The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Death Off the Cuff</i>, written by Simon Christiansen.  <I>Death Off the Cuff</I> was originally released as part of the 2010 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took fifth place.  At the time of posting this transcript, the character of Saint Germain has been nominated for a Xyzzy for Best Individual PC, though the winner has not yet been announced.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Death_Off_the_Cuff'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | Germain?", says Shane Pearson.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Is it not obvious?" says the Doctor. "The detective has figured out
<b>Floyd</b> | who killed the Colonel and intends to explain to us how he did it."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You twirl your moustache. "The good Doctor is correct, Mademoiselle
<b>Floyd</b> | Pearson. I have indeed solved the case. The murderer was clever, but
<b>Floyd</b> | he proved no match for my gray matter." You tap a finger against the
<b>Floyd</b> | side of your head to illustrate the point.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | They all stare at you expectantly, like children waiting to be told a
<b>Floyd</b> | bedtime story. And who can blame them? You are, after all, Anthony
<b>Floyd</b> | Saint Germain, the great French detective. No criminal has ever been a
<b>Floyd</b> | match for you, and everybody is looking forward to a description of
<b>Floyd</b> | your brilliant deductions.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There is just one small problem. One tiny detail that makes it
<b>Floyd</b> | different this time. A mere trifle, really. This time you have no idea
<b>Floyd</b> | who did it. An entire day of investigation have turned up nothing. No
<b>Floyd</b> | one even seems to have a damn motive.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | No matter. Most of the time when you do this the murderer breaks down
<b>Floyd</b> | and confesses half way through your speech anyway. All you have to do
<b>Floyd</b> | is stall and wait for the guilty party to slip up. People love talking
<b>Floyd</b> | about themselves. If you wait long enough, they always end up
<b>Floyd</b> | revealing something you can use.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is going to be fine.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | First time players should type ABOUT for some basic information about
<b>Floyd</b> | the game.

<b>Floyd</b> | Hotel Lounge
<b>Floyd</b> | The hotel lounge is small, but comfortable. A large couch stands near
<b>Floyd</b> | one wall, with a mahogany couch table in front of it. Next to it is an
<b>Floyd</b> | old fashioned reclining chair. In the corner of the room, an old
<b>Floyd</b> | grandfather clock is steadily ticking away, lending a dignified air to
<b>Floyd</b> | the proceedings.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | James Garfield, the owner of Seafront Hotel, is standing by the clock,
<b>Floyd</b> | watching you expectantly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Jonathan Allington stands next to Mr. Garfield, his employer. His face
<b>Floyd</b> | reveals no emotions.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Shane Pearson is sitting in the couch with her legs crossed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Doctor Elias Mole is sitting next to Shane in the couch, leaning
<b>Floyd</b> | forward with an inquisitive look in his eyes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Count Heinrich Von Carstein is leaning backwards in the reclining
<b>Floyd</b> | chair, sipping a glass of wine.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Detective Goodfellow is standing behind you, eagerly waiting to assist

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | "Death Off the Cuff" is a conversation based game where you need to
<b>Floyd</b> | talk about various things to move the plot forward. This is
<b>Floyd</b> | accomplished by typing "TALK ABOUT SOMETHING", or simply "T SOMETHING"
<b>Floyd</b> | for convenience. "Something" can be anything you can see in the
<b>Floyd</b> | environment. You will often have more than one thing to say about the
<b>Floyd</b> | same object.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can only talk about visible objects, not just arbitrary topics.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Occasionally, talking about something or someone will bring up a menu
<b>Floyd</b> | with various options for what to say. If you don't like any of the
<b>Floyd</b> | options, you can simply change the topic by talking about something
<b>Floyd</b> | else instead.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Talking doesn't solve every problem, though. You may also need to
<b>Floyd</b> | physically interact with things and people to progress.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Make sure you examine your surrounding regularly. You might notice new
<b>Floyd</b> | things.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you get stuck, typing "HINT" or "HELP" will provide a hint on what
<b>Floyd</b> | to do in the current situation. There is usually more than one hint
<b>Floyd</b> | available for a given scene, so if the first one doesn't help the next
<b>Floyd</b> | one might.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Typing "WALKTHRU" will provide detailed instructions on how to finish
<b>Floyd</b> | the game.

<b>Floyd</b> | Lastly, I would like thank my testers: Katzy, Brooks Reeves and John
<b>Floyd</b> | Murphy.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    The mystery, for you, started two years ago.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Come here, there's something I want to tell you," your old
<b>Floyd</b> | grandfather had said, "Quick, before your mother comes back in the
<b>Floyd</b> | room."
<b>Floyd</b> |    The smell of antiseptic and an unidentifiable odor that seemed to
<b>Floyd</b> | emanate from the very walls of the old age home made you uncomfortable
<b>Floyd</b> | enough.  The thought of your grandfather having a secret he wanted to
<b>Floyd</b> | share only made that unplanned visit to the Shady Pastures
<b>Floyd</b> | Convalescent Home all the more nerve-wracking.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "If you have any mind for it, go back to Dalton.  Your Grandmother
<b>Floyd</b> | left something she wanted you to have."  Before you could ask him
<b>Floyd</b> | specifics, he turned away as your Mom reentered the room with a bottle
<b>Floyd</b> | of water.  The topic would not come up again, which was fine by you.
<b>Floyd</b> | No one in your family had been to the Dalton property since your
<b>Floyd</b> | grandmother died over eight years ago, and as far as you knew, the
<b>Floyd</b> | place could have burned down by now.
<b>Floyd</b> |    When you thought back to your childhood, you could remember
<b>Floyd</b> | spending the summers with your grandmother at the old house in Dalton,
<b>Floyd</b> | located on the Texas Gulf Coast.  Grandma Eleanor Sorich always had
<b>Floyd</b> | smiles for you, and made you feel that she understood you better than
<b>Floyd</b> | you did yourself.  When she eventually passed away, you were deeply
<b>Floyd</b> | saddened, as if you had lost one of your best friends.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Grandpa Sorich, on the other hand, was a different story.  A bitter
<b>Floyd</b> | man who spent most of the time during your visits off by the Dalton
<b>Floyd</b> | Harbor with his drinking buddies.  As far as you could tell, their
<b>Floyd</b> | marriage was more of convenience than love.  At her funeral, he showed
<b>Floyd</b> | only the faintest hint of remorse.  He spent the years after her death
<b>Floyd</b> | mostly silent in an old age home...  until that visit.
<b>Floyd</b> |    It's been two years since your chat with Grandpa.  In that time,
<b>Floyd</b> | you have often reflected back on the conversation, curious as to what
<b>Floyd</b> | would make your grandfather act in such a mysterious fashion, and
<b>Floyd</b> | curious about what your grandmother could've possibly wanted you to
<b>Floyd</b> | have.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Finally, an unexpected road trip across the country has allowed you
<b>Floyd</b> | to make a brief detour at the old family property.  You find yourself
<b>Floyd</b> | back in the draining heat of Dalton, Texas, assessing the old Sorich
<b>Floyd</b> | property your family all but abandoned years ago.  It hasn't burned
<b>Floyd</b> | down, but indeed stood patiently waiting for someone to return.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | house, like your grandfather, has not aged gracefully, and looks as if
<b>Floyd</b> | it too is just waiting out the rest of it's years....

<b>Floyd</b> | Front of House
<b>Floyd</b> |    You stand before the small coast house where you used to go on
<b>Floyd</b> | summer vacations with your parents when you were young.  A weathered
<b>Floyd</b> | fence which has long since given up it's white paint to hot Texas sun
<b>Floyd</b> | and salty coastal air surrounds the property.  To the east lies Beach
<b>Floyd</b> | Street, as old as the town itself, separating the property from harbor
<b>Floyd</b> | and the bay.  Across the road to the east you can make out the remains
<b>Floyd</b> | of the Dalton Fishing Pier and Dalton Harbor.  The old house itself is
<b>Floyd</b> | to the west, facing the water like it has for the last 100 years.
<b>Floyd</b> | Though you are shin deep in weeds, you can make out a small path that
<b>Floyd</b> | winds around the house to the northwest and southwest.  Crumbling
<b>Floyd</b> | cement stairs lead up to the porch of the house.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Stephen Newton has been a fan of interactive fiction since discovering
<b>Floyd</b> | Zork I on his friend's Apple II in the early 80's.  He is recently
<b>Floyd</b> | married and enjoys playing computer games as well as researching
<b>Floyd</b> | ancient history and watching as many movies as work and real life
<b>Floyd</b> | permit.  The Coast House is his first piece of IF.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Stephen would like to thank his wife Lisa for her patience during the
<b>Floyd</b> | many late nights he spent writing this game.  He also thanks his
<b>Floyd</b> | brother Dan for co-authoring - without whom the game never would have
<b>Floyd</b> | been finished on time.  Special thanks go to beta testers Steve `Nutz'
<b>Floyd</b> | Rossi and John & Lisa Conner.  Additional thanks to Mike Roberts for
<b>Floyd</b> | writing the fine product TADS; Stephen Granade for organizing the
<b>Floyd</b> | Interactive Fiction Competition; and all the people who responded to
<b>Floyd</b> | programming questions in the rec.arts.int-fiction newsgroup!

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Dan Newton would like to thank his older brother Stephen, without
<b>Floyd</b> | whom, he wouldn't have the fondness for creative writing that he does.
<b>Floyd</b> | He would also like to thank his girlfriend, Christine Scott, for
<b>Floyd</b> | testing the game and for putting up with his rather bizarre ways of

<b>Floyd</b> | to keep the memory of the true coast house alive in the family.

<b>Floyd</b> |    On this side of the pier, only one guardrail remains, the other
<b>Floyd</b> | lost to the elements.  Choppy water splashes against the few remaining
<b>Floyd</b> | supports beneath the pier sending plumes of water shooting up through
<b>Floyd</b> | the planks.  The constant splashes has made the planks of the pier
<b>Floyd</b> | mossy and slick.  A sign nearby advised that the pier is closed until

<b>Floyd</b> |    You remember stories your grandfather would tell you about Dalton
<b>Floyd</b> | Harbor back in his day - the shrimp industry supported the town and
<b>Floyd</b> | boats could be seen leaving early in the morning with seagulls
<b>Floyd</b> | circling closely overhead as their nets were drawn up.  Now, however,
<b>Floyd</b> | one would uses the term harbor loosely when viewing this small dock.
<b>Floyd</b> | Today's harbor is nothing more than a couple of rotted wooden poles
<b>Floyd</b> | being used to tie old shrimp boats against.  The shrimp boats hardly
<b>Floyd</b> | look seaworthy with their hulls scraped and their nets faded and
<b>Floyd</b> | tattered.  A small A-shaped sign offers tourist bargains.

<b>Floyd</b> | HOW TO PLAY
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In an adventure game, you play by typing commands that describe what
<b>Floyd</b> | you want to do.  Unfortunately, the game isn't as smart as you are, so
<b>Floyd</b> | it can't understand nearly as many sentences as a person could.
<b>Floyd</b> | You'll type things like the following:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    GO NORTH
<b>Floyd</b> |    NORTH
<b>Floyd</b> |    N
<b>Floyd</b> |    UP
<b>Floyd</b> |    TAKE THE BOX
<b>Floyd</b> |    PUT THE FLOPPY DISK INTO THE BOX
<b>Floyd</b> |    REPAIR THE LAMP WITH THE GLUE
<b>Floyd</b> |    CLOSE BOX
<b>Floyd</b> |    LOOK AT DISK
<b>Floyd</b> |    TAKE DISK OUT OF BOX
<b>Floyd</b> |    LOOK IN BOX
<b>Floyd</b> |    WEAR THE CONICAL HAT
<b>Floyd</b> |    TAKE OFF HAT
<b>Floyd</b> |    CLOSE BOX
<b>Floyd</b> |    TURN ON THE LANTERN
<b>Floyd</b> |    RING BELL
<b>Floyd</b> |    PUSH BUTTON
<b>Floyd</b> |    TURN KNOB
<b>Floyd</b> |    EAT COOKIE
<b>Floyd</b> |    DRINK MILK
<b>Floyd</b> |    READ NEWSPAPER
<b>Floyd</b> |    LOOK THROUGH WINDOW
<b>Floyd</b> |    UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY
<b>Floyd</b> |    CLIMB UP THE LADDER
<b>Floyd</b> |    TURN THE KNOB
<b>Floyd</b> |    JUMP
<b>Floyd</b> |    GET IN THE CAR
<b>Floyd</b> |    GET OUT OF THE CAR
<b>Floyd</b> |    GET ON THE HORSE
<b>Floyd</b> |    GIVE WAND TO WIZARD
<b>Floyd</b> |    ASK WIZARD ABOUT WAND
<b>Floyd</b> |    SHOW SWORD TO WIZARD
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | OTHER CHARACTERS
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You may encounter other characters in the game.  You can interact in
<b>Floyd</b> | certain ways with these characters.  For example, you can GIVE things
<b>Floyd</b> | to them, SHOW things to them and even attack them (although this is a
<b>Floyd</b> | non-violent game, so you shouldn't expect to solve any of your
<b>Floyd</b> | problems this way).  In addition, you can ask characters about things:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    ASK WIZARD ABOUT WAND
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | SPECIAL COMMANDS
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The game understands several special commands that you can use to
<b>Floyd</b> | control the game.  You can use these commands at any prompt.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | AGAIN or G:  Repeats your last command.  If your last input line was
<b>Floyd</b> | composed of several commands, only the last command on the line is
<b>Floyd</b> | repeated.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | CREDITS:  Show a list of the people that developed this game.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | INVENTORY or I:  Shows the list of items you are carrying.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | LOOK or L:  Shows the full description of your location.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | NOTIFY:  Tells the game whether you want to be notified of score
<b>Floyd</b> | changes when they happen.  When the game starts, NOTIFY is turned on,
<b>Floyd</b> | so you will see a message whenever you do something that changes your
<b>Floyd</b> | score.  If you'd prefer not to see these messages, type NOTIFY.  (If
<b>Floyd</b> | you later change your mind, typing NOTIFY again will turn notification
<b>Floyd</b> | back on.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | OOPS:  Allows you to correct the spelling of a word in the last
<b>Floyd</b> | command.  You can use OOPS when the game displays this complaint:  "I
<b>Floyd</b> | don't know the word ."  Immediately after this message, you can type
<b>Floyd</b> | OOPS followed by the corrected spelling of the misspelled word.  You
<b>Floyd</b> | can only type one word after OOPS, so this command doesn't allow you
<b>Floyd</b> | to correct certain types of errors, such as when you run two words
<b>Floyd</b> | together without a spce.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | QUIT:  Stops the game, and returns you to your operating system.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | RESTART:  Starts the game over from the beginning.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | RESTORE:  Restores a position previously saved with the SAVE command.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | SAVE:  Stores the current state of the game in a disk file, so that
<b>Floyd</b> | you can come back to the same place later (with the RESTORE command).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | SCORE:  Shows you your current score, the maximum possible score, and
<b>Floyd</b> | the number of turns you have taken so far.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | SCRIPT:  Starts writing everything you see on the screen (your
<b>Floyd</b> | commands and the game's responses) to a disk file.  The game will ask
<b>Floyd</b> | you for a filename to be used for the transcript; you should select a
<b>Floyd</b> | filename that does not yet exist on your disk, because if you use an
<b>Floyd</b> | existing filename, data in the file will be destroyed.  Use the
<b>Floyd</b> | UNSCRIPT command to stop making the transcript.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | TERSE:  Tells the game that you wish to see only short descriptions of
<b>Floyd</b> | locations you have already seen when you enter them.  This is the
<b>Floyd</b> | default mode. See also the VERBOSE command.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | UNDO:  Take back the last command.  This can be used multiple times to
<b>Floyd</b> | take back a series of commands in sequence.  The number of commands
<b>Floyd</b> | that you can undo at any given time varies, but you can generally undo
<b>Floyd</b> | over a hundred commands.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | UNSCRIPT:  Turns off the transcript being made with the SCRIPT
<b>Floyd</b> | command.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | VERBOSE:  Tells the game to show you the full description of every
<b>Floyd</b> | location you enter, whether or not you have seen the description
<b>Floyd</b> | before.  By default, the game will show you the full description of a
<b>Floyd</b> | location only when you first enter it, and will show you the short
<b>Floyd</b> | description each time you enter the location thereafter.  Of course,
<b>Floyd</b> | you can get a full description at any time by typing LOOK.  See also
<b>Floyd</b> | the TERSE command.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | VERSION:  Shows you the current version of the game.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | WAIT or Z:  Causes game time to pass.  When the game is waiting for
<b>Floyd</b> | you to type command, no game time passes; you can use this command to
<b>Floyd</b> | wait for something to happen.

<b>Floyd</b> |    When you were a youngster, you remember this pier being a lot

<b>Floyd</b> | pier and had her way with it.  The pier extends out into the water but
<b>Floyd</b> | the wood is broken and splintered farther out stopping well short of
<b>Floyd</b> | it's original length.  A second, inaccessible section of the pier is
<b>Floyd</b> | visible even farther out; the area that connected the two having been
<b>Floyd</b> | washed away.
<b>Floyd</b> |    On this side of the pier, only one guardrail remains, the other
<b>Floyd</b> | lost to the elements.  Choppy water splashes against the few remaining
<b>Floyd</b> | supports beneath the pier sending plumes of water shooting up through
<b>Floyd</b> | the planks.  The constant splashes has made the planks of the pier
<b>Floyd</b> | mossy and slick.  A sign nearby advised that the pier is closed until
<b>Floyd</b> | storm damage can be repaired.  What remains of the pier extends to the
<b>Floyd</b> | east.  The service road leads away to the west.

<b>Floyd</b> | of two children from Beauregard and Esther Lynn Dalton, wealthy cattle
<b>Floyd</b> | ranchers from Lubbock, Texas. Clyde and his brother, Claude, came to
<b>Floyd</b> | what was then known as Port Dietrich in 1922.  From an inheritance
<b>Floyd</b> | left by their parents, Claude opened a meat-packing plant while Clyde
<b>Floyd</b> | began investing money to local businesses.  The meat-packing plant and
<b>Floyd</b> | the businesses funded by Clyde helped the growth of Port Dietrich.  In
<b>Floyd</b> | 1925, the increasing port population and growth of the economy,
<b>Floyd</b> | despite nationwide depression, made Port Dietrich eligible for "town"
<b>Floyd</b> | status.  With considerable influence from the Dalton brothers, Port
<b>Floyd</b> | Dietrich was renamed "Dalton."  Claude left the Dalton estate in 1930.
<b>Floyd</b> | Clyde Dalton, an influential Board member and businessman himself,
