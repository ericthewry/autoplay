The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Uncle Zebulon's Will</i>, written by Magnus&nbsp;Olsson.  <i>Uncle Zebulon's Will</i> was originally released in 1995. It took first place in the TADS Division of the very first IF Competition and was consequently included as a piece of 'modern' (for the time) IF on Activision's 1996 commercial release of "<A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Classic_Text_Adventure_Masterpieces_of_Infocom">Classic Text Adventure: Masterpieces of Infocom</A>". You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Uncle_Zebulon%27s_Will"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

</br>Once we were done playing <i>Uncle Zebulon's Will</i>, we moved on to playing another Olsson game, <i>Zugzwang</i>, so I've just included that in the transcript as well.  Enjoy!</br>

<b>Floyd</b> | Uncle Zebulon's Will by Magnus Olsson (mol@df.lth.se)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The news of your uncle Zebulon's death came as a shock.  You've been
<b>Floyd</b> | out of touch lately, and since you left for college a year ago you
<b>Floyd</b> | haven't heard a word from him.  During your childhood, however, your
<b>Floyd</b> | eccentric uncle - once the black sheep of the family, an unsuccessful

<b>Floyd</b> | alchemist and self-proclaimed wizard, reputed to be a very wealthy man
<b>Floyd</b> | - was your favourite relative.  Perhaps you were his favourite nephew
<b>Floyd</b> | as well.  You miss his stories of distant realms and the magic gadgets
<b>Floyd</b> | he loved to demonstrate...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You leave for home immediately on receiving the message, but the

<b>Floyd</b> | trip is long and you're delayed by the inevitable train strikes.  When
<b>Floyd</b> | you finally arrive, you find your family in a state of frustrated
<b>Floyd</b> | confusion.  Not only is your uncle's will written in a quite unsuitably
<b>Floyd</b> | sarcastic tone, seriously insulting most of your relatives, but it
<b>Floyd</b> | turns out there isn't much of an inheritance to fight over; despite a
<b>Floyd</b> | thorough search of your uncle's house, no fabulous treasures are found.

<b>Floyd</b> | The bequests for you and your cousins are almost pathetic:  one small
<b>Floyd</b> | memento each, to be selected after everybody else have made their
<b>Floyd</b> | choices.  Yet what is there to lose?  At least you'd like to have one
<b>Floyd</b> | last look at uncle Zeb's house; maybe you'll find some treasure
<b>Floyd</b> | overlooked by the others, perhaps something magical...

<b>Floyd</b> | Shed

<b>Floyd</b> |    This shed was used by uncle Zebulon for his goldmaking:  strange
<b>Floyd</b> | experiments that could often be smelt from across town, even occasional
<b>Floyd</b> | explosions.  Your uncle spoke very little of his experiments, and never
<b>Floyd</b> | showed any signs of making money out of them, yet people generally
<b>Floyd</b> | assumed that they were successful and a source of great wealth.  In all
<b>Floyd</b> | other matters, your family regarded uncle Zebulon as a useless dreamer,

<b>Floyd</b> | even an embarrassment, but they took a certain reluctant pride in his
<b>Floyd</b> | reputation as a goldmaker.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    As a consequence of your relatives' frantic search for valuables,
<b>Floyd</b> | the place is in an even greater mess than you remember.  The workbench
<b>Floyd</b> | has been cleared of the usual odds and ends, and all even remotely

<b>Floyd</b> | useful tools or utensils have been removed.  Large heaps of junk and
<b>Floyd</b> | broken glass remain in the corners, and in the centre of the room is a
<b>Floyd</b> | large, hideous statue of a three-eyed dog - probably some exotic idol
<b>Floyd</b> | brought home from your uncle's travels.  You can't remember ever seeing
<b>Floyd</b> | it before.

<b>Floyd</b> | melancholy way at the workbench, as if lamenting the mess.  It looks
<b>Floyd</b> | very much out of place in this shed.

<b>Floyd</b> |    Apart from its general ugliness, one thing about the dog immediately
<b>Floyd</b> | catches your attention:  for some unfathomable reason, it has three

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Shed
<b>Floyd</b> |    This shed was used by uncle Zebulon for his goldmaking:  strange
<b>Floyd</b> | experiments that could often be smelt from across town, even occasional
<b>Floyd</b> | explosions.  Your uncle spoke very little of his experiments, and never
<b>Floyd</b> | showed any signs of making money out of them, yet people generally
<b>Floyd</b> | assumed that they were successful and a source of great wealth.  In all

<b>Floyd</b> | other matters, your family regarded uncle Zebulon as a useless dreamer,
<b>Floyd</b> | even an embarrassment, but they took a certain reluctant pride in his
<b>Floyd</b> | reputation as a goldmaker.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    As a consequence of your relatives' frantic search for valuables,
<b>Floyd</b> | the place is in an even greater mess than you remember.  The workbench

<b>Floyd</b> | has been cleared of the usual odds and ends, and all even remotely
<b>Floyd</b> | useful tools or utensils have been removed.  Large heaps of junk and
<b>Floyd</b> | broken glass remain in the corners, and in the centre of the room is a
<b>Floyd</b> | large, hideous statue of a three-eyed dog - probably some exotic idol
<b>Floyd</b> | brought home from your uncle's travels.  You can't remember ever seeing
<b>Floyd</b> | it before.  Powerful beams of coloured light emerge from the statue's

<b>Floyd</b> | eyes, forming an image on the workbench.
<b>Floyd</b> |    You see a blue bottle here.  On the bronze stand you see a scrap of
<b>Floyd</b> | paper.  The blue bottle seems to contain a gold ball.

<b>Floyd</b> | Shed
<b>Floyd</b> |    This shed was used by uncle Zebulon for his goldmaking:  strange
<b>Floyd</b> | experiments that could often be smelt from across town, even occasional

<b>Floyd</b> | explosions.  Your uncle spoke very little of his experiments, and never
<b>Floyd</b> | showed any signs of making money out of them, yet people generally
<b>Floyd</b> | assumed that they were successful and a source of great wealth.  In all
<b>Floyd</b> | other matters, your family regarded uncle Zebulon as a useless dreamer,
<b>Floyd</b> | even an embarrassment, but they took a certain reluctant pride in his
<b>Floyd</b> | reputation as a goldmaker.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    As a consequence of your relatives' frantic search for valuables,
<b>Floyd</b> | the place is in an even greater mess than you remember.  The workbench
<b>Floyd</b> | has been cleared of the usual odds and ends, and all even remotely
<b>Floyd</b> | useful tools or utensils have been removed.  Large heaps of junk and
<b>Floyd</b> | broken glass remain in the corners, and in the centre of the room is a

<b>Floyd</b> | large, hideous statue of a three-eyed dog - probably some exotic idol
<b>Floyd</b> | brought home from your uncle's travels.  You can't remember ever seeing
<b>Floyd</b> | it before.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a mysterious dark hole in the middle of the workbench.

<b>Floyd</b> | Garden

<b>Floyd</b> |    You are standing just inside the gate of uncle Zebulon's garden, on
<b>Floyd</b> | the weed-infested gravel path that leads east up to the porch of the
<b>Floyd</b> | house.  On the north side of the lawn, almost hidden behind the huge,
<b>Floyd</b> | unkempt rosebushes, is the garden shed.  The bright summer sun glistens
<b>Floyd</b> | on the wet grass, and the air, fresh from the recent rain, is alive
<b>Floyd</b> | with the buzzing of insects and filled with sweet fragrances.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you step onto the porch, the demon looks pointedly at you.  "What?
<b>Floyd</b> | Back already?  Aren't you satisfied with your blue bottle?  Remember
<b>Floyd</b> | that you're not allowed to change your mind!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Porch

<b>Floyd</b> |    On this rickety porch, uncle Zebulon used to spend the long summer
<b>Floyd</b> | evenings, relaxing in his rocking chair and smoking his pipe.  Your
<b>Floyd</b> | parents used to sneer at his laziness; why couldn't he use all that
<b>Floyd</b> | spare time to make his garden look a little more respectable?
<b>Floyd</b> |    The rocking chair is still there, right outside the front door of
<b>Floyd</b> | the house. It is not occupied by uncle Zebulon, though, but by a

<b>Floyd</b> | sneering, rather mean-looking demon.
<b>Floyd</b> |    You see a letter here.
<b>Floyd</b> |    The demon is picking his claws with a rather nasty-looking dagger.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The demon shrugs and lets you past.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Hall
<b>Floyd</b> |    Uncle Zeb's house isn't large enough to warrant a large entrance
<b>Floyd</b> | hall, but at least there is this small room, with just enough space for
<b>Floyd</b> | a coathanger and a narrow staircase up to a trapdoor in the ceiling.
<b>Floyd</b> | Wooden doors lead north, east, west and south.
<b>Floyd</b> |    You see a book, a sheet of writing paper, a crystal ball, a green

<b>Floyd</b> | bottle, a magic wand, a large carrot, a small glass flask, a scroll, an
<b>Floyd</b> | iron coin, a small teak box, and a lead coin here.

<b>Floyd</b> | Plain
<b>Floyd</b> |    Around you, a seemingly limitless expanse of flat, greyish ground,

<b>Floyd</b> | smells of sand and salt; in the distance you hear the booming sound of
<b>Floyd</b> | surf.  You recognize the view from uncle Zebulon's tower.  Not a trace

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You let your gaze wander around the distant horizon, where palm

<b>Floyd</b> | city somehow doesn't seem dead, but rather asleep.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Finally, you reach the end of the road, in an open place just in
<b>Floyd</b> | front of the city's gates.  The polished marble walls tower above you,
<b>Floyd</b> | gleaming coolly with reflected starlight.  Not a single sentry hails

<b>Floyd</b> | you.  As you approach the tall bronze gates, they swing open to leave

<b>Floyd</b> | you enter the city to claim your inheritance.

<b>Floyd</b> | It has been a fierce battle, full of bold moves, daring attacks,

<b>Floyd</b> | exchanged, it finally looks as if it is your turn. The White King and

<b>Floyd</b> | without help.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The White King calls you to action. It is time to make your move.
