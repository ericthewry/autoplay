The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Starborn</i>, written by Juhana Leinonen.  <I>Starborn</I> was part of the seventieth collection of Speed IFs (can you believe it?). You can learn more about all the games in the Even Newer New Year's Speed, including how to download them, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Even_Newer_New_Year'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | The shuttle takes off and starts its descent. Soon I feel something
<b>Floyd</b> | I've never experienced before: gravity pulling me downwards to my
<b>Floyd</b> | seat.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My heart is beating fast. I don't know if it's the excitement or if
<b>Floyd</b> | something is wrong. I start to feel increasing discomfort. The shuttle
<b>Floyd</b> | touches ground and I almost pass out.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I manage to stumble out of the shuttle into the open air--and a
<b>Floyd</b> | wonderful, magnificent view of the Earth opens before me. It is
<b>Floyd</b> | everything I could have hoped for and more. A breath of air caresses
<b>Floyd</b> | my being and the Sun's warmth feels so soft. Actual atmosphere is so
<b>Floyd</b> | much gentler than Magellan's artificial environment.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Is everything allright, young man?" I hear someone ask. "Yes," I
<b>Floyd</b> | manage to whisper. It's hard to speak when you have to fight the pull
<b>Floyd</b> | of gravity with all the strength you have.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A woman behind me catches me as I fall. She sounds hysterical, she's
<b>Floyd</b> | calling for the medical personnel. I see her face and the blue sky
<b>Floyd</b> | behind her. A lone bird flies past the sun.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My vision fades but I can still hear the people around me. They are
