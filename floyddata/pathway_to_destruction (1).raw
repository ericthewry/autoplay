The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Pathway to Destruction</i>, written by Richard Otter.  <I>Pathway to Destruction</I> was originally released as part of the 2005 Finish the Game Comp, where it took first place. It went on to place ninth in the 2005 InsideADRIFT End of Year Comp.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Pathway_to_Destruction'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | Pathway to Destruction by Richard Otter, version 1.21
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You have worked at the Institute of Transportation for nearly five
<b>Floyd</b> | years. As one of the engineering team in the Research and Development
<b>Floyd</b> | section, it is considered a highly respected position and is
<b>Floyd</b> | particularly well paid. In recent years it has become even more
<b>Floyd</b> | important, as with a growing population the global transport system is
<b>Floyd</b> | struggling to cope. A complete collapse has been predicted in a little
<b>Floyd</b> | under five years time.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You are currently working on the Pathway project which is a new
<b>Floyd</b> | developmental Rapid Transit System (RTS).  This holds out the promise
<b>Floyd</b> | of fast, efficient and cheap travel for the whole planet.  You do not
<b>Floyd</b> | fully understand the science but it has something to do with
<b>Floyd</b> | particles, magnetism and time travel. Basically, you arrive at your
<b>Floyd</b> | destination the exact same moment you leave your starting point.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The initial trials have been extremely promising and the first long
<b>Floyd</b> | distance test is now underway. You are being 'particled' (as it is
<b>Floyd</b> | called) from one side of the planet to the other and then back again.
<b>Floyd</b> | At this very moment you are being strapped into a chair situated in
<b>Floyd</b> | the centre of the testing chamber. Colin, the senior technician on
<b>Floyd</b> | project, is giving you the thumbs up sign from the control room and
<b>Floyd</b> | the ignition lights have just come on. Your hands and feet are
<b>Floyd</b> | starting to tingle and your vision is blurring; then nothing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nothing until now.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In this adventure you are John Taylor, one of the engineering team in
<b>Floyd</b> | the Research and Development section of the Institute of
<b>Floyd</b> | Transportation.  Your goal is a simple one - to try and make sense of
<b>Floyd</b> | the world you find yourself in.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Some useful commands to help you in your mission -
<b>Floyd</b> | use object with object, get all from object, give object to character
<b>Floyd</b> | pick lock, look under object, look through object
<b>Floyd</b> | talk to character, ask character about subject
<b>Floyd</b> | look through object, move rubble with bar

<b>Floyd</b> | "We have no idea, you didn't appear at the destination test site and

<b>Floyd</b> | Colin asks, "Are you all right?"
<b>Floyd</b> | Shaking your head you reply, "Yeh, I must have been dreaming." The Tarc

<b>Floyd</b> | Colin stares at it and asks, "How did you get that? You didn't have it
