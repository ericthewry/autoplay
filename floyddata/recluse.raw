The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Recluse</i>, written by Stephen&nbsp;Gorrell.  <i>Recluse</i> was released in 2008, approximately one month before it was explored by ClubFloyd, and was not released as part of any competition.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Recluse"><u>the IFwiki</u></A>.</br>

<b>Floyd</b> | deliver a small, sealed package, in-person delivery required, contents
<b>Floyd</b> | unknown.  Your task is made a bit more difficult because immediately
<b>Floyd</b> | following the death of J. Daggett's lovely young bride Emmeline some

<b>Floyd</b> | three years ago, he quietly withdrew into the depths of his
<b>Floyd</b> | magnificent Gothic mansion, and no one has had any direct contact with

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Main Entrance
<b>Floyd</b> | You are standing before the main entrance to a huge, foreboding Gothic

<b>Floyd</b> | mansion.  A massive pair of solid oak doors leads inside.  To the
<b>Floyd</b> | south marble steps lead down to the gravel driveway behind you.  At
<b>Floyd</b> | the moment the doors are closed, and there is no one in sight.  There
<b>Floyd</b> | is a polished brass plaque mounted on the wall next to the doors.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your car broke down a mile up the road, and you're eager to complete

<b>Floyd</b> | your delivery and get started on your long walk back to town.  You
<b>Floyd</b> | can't see a bell or buzzer of any kind near the doors, so you might as
<b>Floyd</b> | well try knocking.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | RECLUSE Playing Tips
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The following tips provide general advice about playing RECLUSE.  No

<b>Floyd</b> | specific information about any game task or puzzle is provided, but
<b>Floyd</b> | they may help you think of some additional things to try if you're
<b>Floyd</b> | stuck.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 1.  If an object has something written on it you may need to type
<b>Floyd</b> | "read [object]" to read it.  Typing "examine [object]" will only

<b>Floyd</b> | include the readable text if the object's primary purpose is to be
<b>Floyd</b> | read (like a sign or plaque).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 2.  Likewise, if an object conceals something you will usually need to
<b>Floyd</b> | type "look in/under/behind [object]" or "search [object]" to find it.
<b>Floyd</b> | Typing "examine [object]" will show you a description of the object,

<b>Floyd</b> | not what it's hiding.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 3.  Examine everything.  If components or additional items are
<b>Floyd</b> | mentioned in the description examine those too.  Even if you don't
<b>Floyd</b> | discover anything new some of the descriptions can be entertaining.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | 4.  Try everything.  Drink some water, kiss a creature, toss a coin
<b>Floyd</b> | into a fountain, whatever pops into your head.  Many objects provide
<b>Floyd</b> | custom responses to actions that are reasonable for the object (like
<b>Floyd</b> | drinking water) but unnecessary to the game.  You can always type UNDO
<b>Floyd</b> | if it backfires on you.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | 5.  Try things multiple times.  Sometimes you'll get a different
<b>Floyd</b> | result on subsequent tries.  However, once you start getting the same
<b>Floyd</b> | response over and over, try something else.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 6.  A number of new verbs are available in RECLUSE.  Don't worry about
<b>Floyd</b> | trying to remember them.  Most of them are not required to complete

<b>Floyd</b> | the game, and the usage of the few that are should be obvious.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | rest are simply there as a player convenience, and to make certain
<b>Floyd</b> | in-game actions seem more natural.  They are:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ALERTS, ALERTS ON/OFF (manage unwinnable game alerts, ON by default)
<b>Floyd</b> | COUNT

<b>Floyd</b> | DEFLATE, DEFLATE WITH
<b>Floyd</b> | DELIVER
<b>Floyd</b> | DIVE, DIVE IN
<b>Floyd</b> | DRINK FROM
<b>Floyd</b> | GET WITH
<b>Floyd</b> | HANG ON/FROM

<b>Floyd</b> | INFLATE, INFLATE WITH
<b>Floyd</b> | LICENSE (show the end-user license agreement)
<b>Floyd</b> | LOAD, LOAD WITH
<b>Floyd</b> | LOWER
<b>Floyd</b> | PICK, PICK WITH
<b>Floyd</b> | RAISE

<b>Floyd</b> | RAKE
<b>Floyd</b> | REPAIR, REPAIR WITH
<b>Floyd</b> | RIDE/PADDLE [direction], RIDE/PADDLE [vehicle] [direction]
<b>Floyd</b> | SCREW, SCREW INTO
<b>Floyd</b> | SHARPEN, SHARPEN WITH
<b>Floyd</b> | SHOOT, SHOOT AT/WITH

<b>Floyd</b> | SWIM, SWIM IN
<b>Floyd</b> | TIE, TIE TO
<b>Floyd</b> | TOUCH WITH
<b>Floyd</b> | UNTIE, UNTIE FROM
<b>Floyd</b> | WADE, WADE IN
<b>Floyd</b> | YELL AT

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 7.  There is also one standard verb that is critically important in
<b>Floyd</b> | RECLUSE.  You've heard it before.  I'm going to say it again.  SAVE
<b>Floyd</b> | OFTEN!  Yes, you can get the game in an unwinnable state.  Yes, there
<b>Floyd</b> | are puzzles that must be completed within a certain number of steps.
<b>Floyd</b> | Yes, backtracking to a previous state after using trial and error to

<b>Floyd</b> | figure out how something is done will be required.  So don't rely
<b>Floyd</b> | solely on undo.  Save, save, SAVE.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 8.  If you do get stuck try the Hint system.  It contains both guided
<b>Floyd</b> | hints that start by offering gentle nudges and progress to outright
<b>Floyd</b> | spoilers, and a walkthrough which is a step-by-step solution to the

<b>Floyd</b> | entire game.  The Hint system also contains general (non-spoiler)
<b>Floyd</b> | questions, background info on some of the items in the game, and a fun
<b>Floyd</b> | things to try section.  One other feature of the hint system is that
<b>Floyd</b> | it does its best to hide hints for things you haven't seen yet.  So if
<b>Floyd</b> | a task requires steps A, B, and C, you will need to complete A to even
<b>Floyd</b> | see the hints for B, and complete A and B to see then hints for C.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 9.  And finally, every effort has been made to ensure that all the
<b>Floyd</b> | puzzles in the game are "fair."  My definition of a "fair" puzzle is
<b>Floyd</b> | one that you either manage to solve in a logical manner, or one that
<b>Floyd</b> | if you do get stuck and ask for help, your reaction to the solution
<b>Floyd</b> | is, "I should have thought of that."  If your reaction is, "That makes

<b>Floyd</b> | no sense!" or, "I never would have thought of that!" then let the
<b>Floyd</b> | author know.  (See CREDITS for contact info.)

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | Ignoring a growing sense of impending doom, you reach out and firmly
<b>Floyd</b> | rap your knuckles on one of the doors.  The sound is surprisingly

<b>Floyd</b> | loud.  You can hear it echoing down the long empty corridor on the
<b>Floyd</b> | other side.  You hold your breath.  Nothing happens. You put your ear
<b>Floyd</b> | to the door.  Not a sound.  Maybe there's nobody home.  No, wait.
<b>Floyd</b> | Sounds like footsteps approaching.  Yes, definitely footsteps.  Long,
<b>Floyd</b> | slow, thudding ones.  Uh oh...
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The doors slowly creak open to reveal a heavyset oriental in a tuxedo,
<b>Floyd</b> | probably the butler.  He bears a remarkable resemblance to Oddjob from
<b>Floyd</b> | the James Bond movie Goldfinger.  He is not smiling, which is just as
<b>Floyd</b> | well.  He probably only smiles while he's torturing salesmen.  You try
<b>Floyd</b> | not to think about it.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Uh...  Hi there.  Is Mr. Winton in by any chance?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In one powerful motion, the butler reaches out, grabs the front of
<b>Floyd</b> | your shirt, and lifts you six inches off the ground.  Holding you at
<b>Floyd</b> | arms length, he demands thickly, "You have appointment?"
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You can hear yourself stammering.  "Uh...  Well actually, no.  But you
<b>Floyd</b> | see I have this package..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The butler's scowl darkens.  Your eyes widen.  A moment later you're
<b>Floyd</b> | flying through the air.  You have been bodily hurled right off the
<b>Floyd</b> | steps!  You barely have time to hear him growl, "Next time, have

<b>Floyd</b> | appointment," behind you before the gravel driveway floats up to meet
<b>Floyd</b> | your pointy head and knocks you silly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After regaining consciousness the first thing you notice is a pair of
<b>Floyd</b> | shiny black boots just inches in front of your eyes.  You hear the
<b>Floyd</b> | metallic snick of a spring-loaded carpenter's tape-measure retracting

<b>Floyd</b> | into its case, followed by a rumbling chuckle. The butler, who has
<b>Floyd</b> | been squatting beside you, stands and pulls a little spiral notebook
<b>Floyd</b> | from his pocket.  He makes an entry, then to nobody in particular
<b>Floyd</b> | states, "Sixteen feet, six and one-half inches.  New record!"  The
<b>Floyd</b> | boots turn and disappear from your line of sight, and you hear him
<b>Floyd</b> | crunching his way back up the driveway.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You hear the mansion door slam shut, and he is gone.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Gravel Driveway
<b>Floyd</b> | The gravel driveway starts at the foot of the marble steps, then winds
<b>Floyd</b> | off across the lawn to the south.  It also continues around the

<b>Floyd</b> | building to the east.  A neatly trimmed hedge borders the outside edge
<b>Floyd</b> | of the driveway on both sides, broken only by the entrance to a
<b>Floyd</b> | flagstone path leading west.  Tall trees dot the landscape, getting
<b>Floyd</b> | generally thicker to the south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You see a business card here.

<b>Floyd</b> | Hmm...  Looks like some poor siding salesman didn't read the plaque.

<b>Floyd</b> | Oh well, not your problem.  On the other hand, at least he managed to

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you just had a few simple props you could easily impersonate a
<b>Floyd</b> | salesman, knock on the doors, and in you'd go.  You already have a

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Guide to Elevator Operation:

<b>Floyd</b> | 1.  Press RESET to start.
<b>Floyd</b> | 2.  Press one or more grid buttons (A1..E5) to extinguish them.  Note
<b>Floyd</b> | that only one row of buttons (A..E) may be accessed during a single
<b>Floyd</b> | entry cycle.
<b>Floyd</b> | 3.  Press NEXT when you have completed your selection(s) to end your
<b>Floyd</b> | entry cycle.

<b>Floyd</b> | 4.  The controller will extinguish one or more grid buttons (following
<b>Floyd</b> | the rules above) and complete it's entry cycle.
<b>Floyd</b> | 5.  Repeat steps 2-4 until all grid buttons have been extinguished.
<b>Floyd</b> | 6.  The elevator door will open if, and only if, the controller is
<b>Floyd</b> | forced to extinguish the last available button.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The next page is filled with a list of the butler's personal notes on
<b>Floyd</b> | the control panel.  They're also in English (thank goodness), and have
<b>Floyd</b> | been heavily crossed out and revised.  It looks like he spent quite a
<b>Floyd</b> | bit of time struggling with it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Tips

<b>Floyd</b> | - The AI is randomized.  J.D.W. says there's no fixed pattern that
<b>Floyd</b> | will always work.  I actually have to outplay the damn thing every
<b>Floyd</b> | time!
<b>Floyd</b> | - I can make it go first by just pushing NEXT, but when I do it always
<b>Floyd</b> | wins.
<b>Floyd</b> | - E1 seems to be a good first move.

<b>Floyd</b> | - Push Next, and after it takes one try to get it into a 2-2-4-4
<b>Floyd</b> | pattern if possible.  Otherwise push Reset and try again.
<b>Floyd</b> | - From there just keep the rows evenly matched until it's down to 2-1.
<b>Floyd</b> | Take the 2 and Bob's your uncle!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There's one page left.  It contains a single note.

<b>Floyd</b> | Or I could just blow it off and use the access card J.D.W. gave me.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You turn the final page, but all that remains is the notebook's back
<b>Floyd</b> | cover.  And taped to the inside of that is a paper sleeve containing a
<b>Floyd</b> | white plastic access card.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The elevator slows to a stop.  The doors whoosh open.  You look out
<b>Floyd</b> | onto a long, beautifully appointed hallway.  You sigh with relief.

<b>Floyd</b> | You've finally made it into the main part of the mansion.  Elated, you
<b>Floyd</b> | step out of the elevator and into the hall.  The elevator doors whoosh
<b>Floyd</b> | closed behind you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You're still trying to figure out which way to go when a heavyset
<b>Floyd</b> | figure in a black tuxedo steps out of the shadows to stand directly in

<b>Floyd</b> | front of you.  You recognize him instantly.  The butler!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your mind whirls.  Fight, or flee?  The elevator doors are closed
<b>Floyd</b> | behind you.  You're at the far end of the hall so the only way you can
<b>Floyd</b> | go is toward the butler.  You look around for a weapon.  A suit of
<b>Floyd</b> | armor holding a double-bladed axe would be about right.  Then

<b>Floyd</b> | suddenly, and without warning, the butler does something totally
<b>Floyd</b> | unexpected.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He smiles, and bows.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Good, evening, and welcome to Seacliff.  Mr. Winton is expecting you.

<b>Floyd</b> | If you will be so kind as to follow me I will take you to his study."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The butler's guttural grunts and snarls have completely vanished.  He
<b>Floyd</b> | speaks to you with a perfect clipped British accent.  You're stunned.
<b>Floyd</b> | A thousand questions flood your mind.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Main Hall
<b>Floyd</b> | J. Daggett Winton's mansion has the kind of tasteful elegance that
<b>Floyd</b> | only the seriously wealthy can afford.  The floor is Italian marble.
<b>Floyd</b> | Groupings of antique furniture sit on Persian rugs.  Impressionist
<b>Floyd</b> | paintings hang on the walls.  The skylight is Tiffany stained glass.
<b>Floyd</b> | And that's just the hall.  You can't even imagine what the rooms must

<b>Floyd</b> | be like.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You're standing at the far north end of the mansion's main hall.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | closed entrance doors can be seen at the other end of the hall.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | elevator doors, also closed, are directly behind you to the south.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The butler is standing here.  He is waiting for you to follow him to
<b>Floyd</b> | Mr. Winton's study.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The hall branches left and right.  You pass open doors leading into a
<b>Floyd</b> | regal dining room, a huge mahogany-paneled library overflowing with
<b>Floyd</b> | leather-bound volumes, a comfortably appointed study, and an atrium
<b>Floyd</b> | filled with exotic plants.  You finally turn right down a side hall

<b>Floyd</b> | and stop before a closed door.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Mr. Winton's study," the butler informs you.  He glances
<b>Floyd</b> | disapprovingly at your somewhat rumpled appearance.  "I will knock and
<b>Floyd</b> | announce your arrival when you are ready."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Hey, thanks to you I've had a pretty rough day," you grumble as you
<b>Floyd</b> | tuck in your shirt.  You do your best to imitate his first words to
<b>Floyd</b> | you.  "You have appointment?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The butler grins.  "All part of the first-class service visitors to
<b>Floyd</b> | Seacliff have come to expect."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Ignoring him for the moment, you run your fingers through your tousled
<b>Floyd</b> | hair, take in a deep breath, and let it out.  You decide that short of
<b>Floyd</b> | a shower and a change of clothes, you're as ready to meet the famously
<b>Floyd</b> | reclusive J. Daggett Winton as you're going to be.  You catch the
<b>Floyd</b> | butler's eye and nod.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Study Entrance
<b>Floyd</b> | You are standing in a short side hallway just outside J. Daggett
<b>Floyd</b> | Winton's study door.  Its wainscoted walls are hung with portraits of
<b>Floyd</b> | his Winton ancestors going back to Captain Darren Lamont Winton III.

<b>Floyd</b> | moment you've been working toward has finally arrived.  You tuck the
<b>Floyd</b> | package firmly under your arm and step into J. Daggett Winton's

<b>Floyd</b> | private study.  His task complete, the butler departs, closing the
<b>Floyd</b> | door behind you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | J. Daggett smiles and offers his hand.  Once you're comfortably seated
<b>Floyd</b> | in his guest chair he gets right to the point.  "I believe you have
<b>Floyd</b> | something for me."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Study
<b>Floyd</b> | You expected a dimly-lit chamber filled with dark leather furniture
<b>Floyd</b> | and smelling of single-malt scotch and cigar smoke.  You're surprised
<b>Floyd</b> | to discover that J. Daggett's study is light, airy, and quite modern.
<b>Floyd</b> | Instead of oak and mahogany the walls and bookcases are made from

<b>Floyd</b> | natural cherry.  Dozens of sticky-notes litter his expansive desk.  It
<b>Floyd</b> | is also home to two large flat-screen computer terminals and an array
<b>Floyd</b> | of state-of-the-art communications equipment.  Message lights flash.
<b>Floyd</b> | Market quotes scroll across one terminal.  The other is
<b>Floyd</b> | teleconferenced into a board meeting of some kind.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The second big surprise is J. Daggett Winton himself.  He still looks
<b>Floyd</b> | like the same swarthy, ruggedly-handsome businessman/adventurer who
<b>Floyd</b> | used to be featured in the news on an almost daily basis.  A little
<b>Floyd</b> | older, a little wearier perhaps.  But the glint of brilliance in his
<b>Floyd</b> | keen gray eyes hasn't dimmed in the least.  However the information
<b>Floyd</b> | about the accident that had taken Emmeline's life hadn't included any

<b>Floyd</b> | mention of his own injuries.  There is no office chair behind his
<b>Floyd</b> | desk.  It has been removed to make room for his high-tech powered
<b>Floyd</b> | wheelchair.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | J. Daggett Winton is sitting on the wheelchair.  He is waiting for you
<b>Floyd</b> | to deliver the package.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ah, finally," he beams.  He checks the wrapping paper to make sure it
<b>Floyd</b> | hasn't been tampered with.  Slipping a finger under a taped seam he
<b>Floyd</b> | tears it open.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You guessed it might be a book, and you are correct.  But what kind of
<b>Floyd</b> | book?  A rare Gutenberg Bible, or perhaps one of Leonardo da Vinci's
<b>Floyd</b> | lost notebooks?  Your pulse quickens with excitement.  You lean

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

<b>Floyd</b> | by J.K. Rowling
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Stunned" doesn't even begin to describe how you feel.  It slowly
<b>Floyd</b> | sinks in that you have risked life and limb to deliver a Harry Potter
<b>Floyd</b> | book to J. Daggett Winton!  But then again, maybe there's something
<b>Floyd</b> | special about this particular copy of this particular Harry Potter

<b>Floyd</b> | book.  Perhaps it is a signed first-edition of some kind with a
<b>Floyd</b> | personal note from J.K. Rowling herself inscribed inside the cover.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then you see the little blue sticker on the cover.

<b>Floyd</b> | WAL*MART

<b>Floyd</b> | $13.99
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You slump into your chair like a deflated balloon!  At least J.
<b>Floyd</b> | Daggett seems happy enough with it.  He thumbs the pages, checks the
<b>Floyd</b> | binding, then turns and slides it onto the bookshelf behind him.  You
<b>Floyd</b> | do notice that it fits neatly into one of the few gaps in the

<b>Floyd</b> | overflowing shelves, and that it is sitting next to books 1 & 2 of the
<b>Floyd</b> | series.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You finally manage to regain enough of your composure to realize that
<b>Floyd</b> | J. Daggett has been watching your reaction to the package's contents

<b>Floyd</b> | Instead of oak and mahogany the walls and bookcases are made from
<b>Floyd</b> | natural cherry.  Dozens of sticky-notes litter his expansive desk.  It
<b>Floyd</b> | is also home to two large flat-screen computer terminals and an array
<b>Floyd</b> | of state-of-the-art communications equipment.  Message lights flash.

<b>Floyd</b> | Market quotes scroll across one terminal.  The other is
<b>Floyd</b> | teleconferenced into a board meeting of some kind.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The second big surprise is J. Daggett Winton himself.  He still looks
<b>Floyd</b> | like the same swarthy, ruggedly-handsome businessman/adventurer who
<b>Floyd</b> | used to be featured in the news on an almost daily basis.  A little

<b>Floyd</b> | older, a little wearier perhaps.  But the glint of brilliance in his

<b>Floyd</b> | mention of his own injuries.  There is no office chair behind his

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You fall in behind his wheelchair.  The short hallway leads to another

<b>Floyd</b> | is confirmed when the doors open as J. Daggett approaches, then close

<b>Floyd</b> | behind you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The descent is brief.  The elevator quickly slows to a stop and the

<b>Floyd</b> | jaw drops in amazement.  You're so overwhelmed that it takes a moment
<b>Floyd</b> | for you to realize that J. Daggett has moved forward.  You trot after

<b>Floyd</b> | him.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Artifacts Chamber
<b>Floyd</b> | The chamber is huge and crammed floor to ceiling with a dazzling array
<b>Floyd</b> | of historical artifacts.  There are Renaissance masterpieces, Grecian
<b>Floyd</b> | sculptures, numerous statues from the Egyptian and Roman pantheons,

<b>Floyd</b> | Aztec and Mayan figurines, suits of samurai armor, a troop of Emperor
<b>Floyd</b> | Qin Shi Huang's terra cotta soldiers, and that's just what's setting
<b>Floyd</b> | out around you.  Chests and packing cases are stacked everywhere.  You
<b>Floyd</b> | half expect to see the crated Ark of the Covenant being wheeled off in
<b>Floyd</b> | the distance.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The elevator doors lie behind you to the north.  The only clear path
<b>Floyd</b> | you can see through the stacked crates continues southward.  Several
<b>Floyd</b> | rather unusual pieces near where you're standing arouse your

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The first time I met Emmeline we were on the face of a cliff.  I was
<b>Floyd</b> | headed up.  She was on her way down.  We stopped on a ledge for a bit
<b>Floyd</b> | of a chat.  I was very impressed by her skill as a climber; and when

<b>Floyd</b> | we met again a day later at a dinner party, I was even more impressed
<b>Floyd</b> | by her grace and beauty.  We continued to see each other and were
<b>Floyd</b> | married within six months.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &ldquoShe was a bit overwhelmed by Seacliff at first, but it didn't

<b>Floyd</b> | take her long to settle in.  She charmed Harold immediately, and he
<b>Floyd</b> | really helped her feel at home.  She especially loved to explore the
<b>Floyd</b> | grounds, and she was delighted the day I showed her the entrance to
<b>Floyd</b> | the caves in the basement.  The cliffs around here are riddled with
<b>Floyd</b> | them.  Some of them go back for miles.  Exploring them together soon
<b>Floyd</b> | became one of our favorite activities.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &ldquoThe day of the accident, we were headed for a large chamber we
<b>Floyd</b> | had named The Cathedral.  Emmeline was in an excellent mood.  I could
<b>Floyd</b> | tell she had some kind of good news she wanted to share with me.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | Cathedral was one of our favorite places to sit and talk.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &ldquoThe only challenge along the route is a sheer descent of about
<b>Floyd</b> | thirty feet down a chasm wall, but we had been up and down it dozens
<b>Floyd</b> | of times before and we had no trouble with it that day.  We were
<b>Floyd</b> | almost there when Em noticed a fresh rock fall, and the new opening

<b>Floyd</b> | that it had exposed.  Of course, we had to see where it led."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The passage beyond opened quickly into a domed chamber.  The walls
<b>Floyd</b> | were polished smooth and had about a dozen small niches cut into them.
<b>Floyd</b> | The center of the chamber was dominated by a wide stone arch.  It was

<b>Floyd</b> | about twelve feet tall and covered with a strange flowing script in a
<b>Floyd</b> | language neither of us had seen before.  The niches were empty, save
<b>Floyd</b> | for one.  It contained a small silver-blue bracelet.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &ldquoThe bracelet was metallic and heavy like gold or platinum might

<b>Floyd</b> | be.  The outside was polished smooth, but the inside had more of the
<b>Floyd</b> | same flowing script engraved around it.  There were no other exits
<b>Floyd</b> | from the room that we could find; and looking at that arch, we
<b>Floyd</b> | couldn't help but think sci-fi..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | J. Daggett smiles slightly in memory.  "Take your pick.  Stargate?

<b>Floyd</b> | The Time Tunnel?  'Beam me up, Scotty?'  I stepped through it first.
<b>Floyd</b> | Nothing.  Em got the idea to slip on the bracelet and try it.  Still
<b>Floyd</b> | nothing.  Oh well.  We took a few pictures and headed back.

<b>Floyd</b> | her, but they had buried her.  That much time with no air...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &ldquoAfter that, all I could do was try to carry her body back.  I
<b>Floyd</b> | remember nothing of the return trip until I reached the chasm.  I was
<b>Floyd</b> | almost at the top when my footing gave way.  We both tumbled to the
<b>Floyd</b> | floor below.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &ldquoI regained consciousness hours later.  My torch was smashed.  I
<b>Floyd</b> | couldn't move my legs.  I figured I would simply die where I lay.  And
<b>Floyd</b> | to be perfectly honest, by that time I was looking forward to doing
<b>Floyd</b> | just that.  I did notice a faint blue glow surrounding Em's body, but

<b>Floyd</b> | I was too far gone to even care what it was.  I was still holding her
<b>Floyd</b> | in my arms when Harold found us."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;
<b>Floyd</b> | It's still too dark to make out any detail.  You continue to wait.
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see the figure a bit more clearly, and you have no doubt now

<b>Floyd</b> | that it's Emmeline.  She's lying on some kind of table in the center
<b>Floyd</b> | of the room.  Her eyes are closed.  Her features are serenely
<b>Floyd</b> | composed.  She is still dressed in khakis and climbing boots as though
<b>Floyd</b> | she had walked out of the cave moments before and stretched out for a
<b>Floyd</b> | bit of a nap.  Her entire body is surrounded by the strange blue glow.
<b>Floyd</b> | She is startlingly beautiful.  You are so struck by the sight that it

<b>Floyd</b> | takes you a moment to realize that J. Daggett has continued his
<b>Floyd</b> | narrative.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Harold took care of everything.  Doctors, police, Em's funeral
<b>Floyd</b> | arrangements, all of it.  I was so deeply depressed that I didn't care
<b>Floyd</b> | if I lived or died.  Then about a month after the accident, Harold

<b>Floyd</b> | finally felt I was well enough for him to tell me that he had secretly
<b>Floyd</b> | arranged to have an empty casket cremated.  He too had discovered the
<b>Floyd</b> | blue glow.  And even stranger, he had found that it was impossible to
<b>Floyd</b> | penetrate.  A needle would stop microns short of actual contact.
<b>Floyd</b> | X-rays just bounced off.  It was as if she was encased in some kind of
<b>Floyd</b> | force field.  He couldn't even be sure if she was dead or alive.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &ldquoAfter that I couldn't wait to get out of the hospital.  I had to
<b>Floyd</b> | know.  I put every ounce of energy and determination I had into my
<b>Floyd</b> | rehabilitation, but it still took me almost six months to get mobile
<b>Floyd</b> | again.  The only thing that made it bearable was Harold's continued

<b>Floyd</b> | assurance that Em's condition remained completely unchanged."

<b>Floyd</b> | lights up a bit.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can now see that the entire back wall of the room is stacked with
<b>Floyd</b> | racks of lab instruments.  All of them are powered off.  Emmeline is
<b>Floyd</b> | lying in front of them on a padded exam table.  J. Daggett touches one
<b>Floyd</b> | of the controls on his wheelchair and all the equipment comes to life

<b>Floyd</b> | at the same time.  Lights flash, traces start scanning across
<b>Floyd</b> | monitors, computer screens display boot up sequences.  He scans the
<b>Floyd</b> | instruments quickly, then turns back to you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "As soon as I got back here I set up this lab and tried everything I
<b>Floyd</b> | could think of to get some kind of reading from inside the field with

<b>Floyd</b> | no success.  I could see her, but I couldn't touch her.  It finally
<b>Floyd</b> | occurred to me to try time-lapse photography.  I set it up to capture
<b>Floyd</b> | any hint of movement inside the field, no matter how slow or faint.
<b>Floyd</b> | And I found it.  A visible pulsing of the carotid artery.  One
<b>Floyd</b> | heartbeat every twenty-seven and a half hours.  She was alive!"
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | J. Daggett leans forward.  "I knew where the field was coming from of
<b>Floyd</b> | course.  She hadn't removed the bracelet after walking through the
<b>Floyd</b> | arch, and she was still wearing it when the passage collapsed.  But it
<b>Floyd</b> | was inside the field with her and untouchable.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &ldquoI've spent over two years now trying to figure out how the

<b>Floyd</b> | bracelet works.  It has to be generating some kind of stasis field.
<b>Floyd</b> | My best guess is that it's a protective device.  The falling rocks
<b>Floyd</b> | activated it.  But why hadn't it turned back off?  I've also had no
<b>Floyd</b> | luck trying to determine its origin.  The script on the arch has
<b>Floyd</b> | proved to be unique.  I needed to try a different approach."

<b>Floyd</b> | also delivered by highly skilled individuals.  Harry Potter and the
<b>Floyd</b> | Sorcerer's Stone arrived by way of an ex-Navy SEAL.  Harry Potter and

<b>Floyd</b> | the Chamber of Secrets was handed to me by a woman who reminded me
<b>Floyd</b> | very much of Emmeline herself.  Both went into the caves.  Neither has
<b>Floyd</b> | returned."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You think about that for a moment before finally asking, "And the
<b>Floyd</b> | second thing I should know?"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "We had both wanted children, but the doctors had told us Em couldn't.
<b>Floyd</b> | Just before we left the chamber containing the arch, Em told me her
<b>Floyd</b> | good news.  She had proved the doctors wrong.  She was going to have a
<b>Floyd</b> | baby."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | J. Daggett is again watching you carefully, trying to gauge your
<b>Floyd</b> | reaction to everything he's told you.  Finally he says, "So now you
<b>Floyd</b> | have to make a choice.  The entrance to the cave is through the wooden
<b>Floyd</b> | door to the west.  The way out is through the steel door behind you.
<b>Floyd</b> | If you choose it, I have misjudged you; and it is best that our
<b>Floyd</b> | relationship ends here.  You can pick up whatever trinket you feel

<b>Floyd</b> | you've earned as payment as you leave.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &ldquoIf you choose to go on I don't need to talk about fame or
<b>Floyd</b> | fortune or glory because you're not motivated by them.  In that case,
<b>Floyd</b> | all I can say further is, 'Good luck, and Godspeed'."

<b>Floyd</b> | Emmeline's Chamber
<b>Floyd</b> | The room has been converted into a laboratory.  The entire back wall
