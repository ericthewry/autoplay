The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Winter Wonderland</i>, written by Laura Knauth.  <I>Winter Wonderland</I> was originally released as part of the 1999 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took first place.  It went on to be nominated for a Xyzzy Award for Best Setting.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Winter_Wonderland'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | companion, her younger brother Sander Bales, has fallen seriously ill
<b>Floyd</b> | with a fever and can barely lift his head from the bed upon which he
<b>Floyd</b> | lies. Young Gretchen could hardly have suspected that such

<b>Floyd</b> | with cupboards from which hang cups and saucers. Near the center of
<b>Floyd</b> | the room stands a modest table surrounded by a few chairs. Centered in

<b>Floyd</b> | Forest Clearing near Cottage
<b>Floyd</b> | The front of a small wooden cottage faces to the west on the far side
<b>Floyd</b> | of this forest clearing. Without the concealing canopy of branches,
<b>Floyd</b> | you see shiny points of light twinkle in the dark sky. The underbrush
<b>Floyd</b> | has grown thick in this area, but it has been cleared away to the east
<b>Floyd</b> | and also looks passable to the southeast. The stone-lined path leads
<b>Floyd</b> | back into the forest to the west.

<b>Floyd</b> | Cottage
<b>Floyd</b> | The cottage is warm and cozy. Burning candles resting in sconces along
<b>Floyd</b> | the walls twinkle brightly illuminating the room in flickering yellow
<b>Floyd</b> | light. The cottage appears to be just a one-room dwelling. The front
<b>Floyd</b> | door is closed to the west. A large walk-in wardrobe has been pushed
<b>Floyd</b> | up against one of the walls; its door hangs open. The portion of the
<b>Floyd</b> | room near the trap door would seem to serve as the kitchen equipped
<b>Floyd</b> | with cupboards from which hang cups and saucers. Near the center of
<b>Floyd</b> | the room stands a modest table surrounded by a few chairs. Centered in
<b>Floyd</b> | the middle of the table is a large glass dome that is now empty. Aside
<b>Floyd</b> | from various knickknacks strewn about, you notice a large couch with

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A little white snow sprite runs right by you carrying a large golden

<b>Floyd</b> | In a far off land, there lies a little village nestled in a snowy
<b>Floyd</b> | mountainscape. As the townsfolk joyously prepare for the coming winter
<b>Floyd</b> | solstice, a young girl living with her family in a humble hut at the
<b>Floyd</b> | outskirts of town gains no comfort in the festivities. Her closest
<b>Floyd</b> | companion, her younger brother Sander Bales, has fallen seriously ill
<b>Floyd</b> | with a fever and can barely lift his head from the bed upon which he
<b>Floyd</b> | lies. Young Gretchen could hardly have suspected that such
<b>Floyd</b> | circumstances would cause the fanciful events that were to occur upon
<b>Floyd</b> | this solstice eve.

<b>Floyd</b> | Cave Entrance
<b>Floyd</b> | This is the base of a giant mountain to the north. The rocky landscape

<b>Floyd</b> | mountainside to the west. Railroad tracks lead from deep inside the
<b>Floyd</b> | cave to a large pile of round stones a few yards from the cave
<b>Floyd</b> | entrance. Looking to the east and southeast, you see the edge of the
<b>Floyd</b> | snowy hills. The mountainous terrain appears impassable in other
<b>Floyd</b> | directions.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You hear the faint groaning of creaky wheels echoing from within the
<b>Floyd</b> | cave. The scraping of metal becomes louder and louder, and suddenly an
<b>Floyd</b> | old mining cart filled with small grey stones emerges from the cave
<b>Floyd</b> | entrance. A stocky, pug-nosed dwarf with a lit candle on his hat
<b>Floyd</b> | pushes the cart along the tracks from behind. Quite oblivious or

<b>Floyd</b> | Fairy Island
<b>Floyd</b> | You have happened upon a magical reverie! In the open clearing
<b>Floyd</b> | encircled by the giant leafy trees, tiny fairies giggle and play as
<b>Floyd</b> | they dance on the giant petals of white orchids which grow abundantly
<b>Floyd</b> | in this soft earth. Mistletoe rich with tiny white berries, spiral up
<b>Floyd</b> | through the branches of the surrounding trees. Moonbeams streak down
<b>Floyd</b> | through the tops of the giant trees illuminating a gurgling spring
<b>Floyd</b> | that wells up warm water in a circular pond at the center of the
<b>Floyd</b> | clearing. Several small doe lie on the soft, lilting grass enchanted
<b>Floyd</b> | by the merry tunes from a company of fauns playing an assortment of
<b>Floyd</b> | flutes, lyres, and reed pipes. The wondrous scene is even more
<b>Floyd</b> | remarkable by the presence of numerous floating orbs that swirl about

<b>Floyd</b> | Thicket Tunnel
<b>Floyd</b> | The thicket almost seems to have formed into a tunnel. The brambles
<b>Floyd</b> | form a complete arch overhead which blocks out most of the moonlight.

<b>Floyd</b> | recognize that a snow-covered trail running along the mountainside is
<b>Floyd</b> | the very same one upon which you had ventured into town so many times.
<b>Floyd</b> | You scamper up the mountain side to the trail which gleams brilliantly

<b>Floyd</b> | left that you are able to muster.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You return home to a teary reunion with your worried parents. And to
<b>Floyd</b> | your great surprise and delight, Sander was well enough to sit at the
<b>Floyd</b> | fireside awaiting your return. When you reveal the handsome shoes you
<b>Floyd</b> | carried through the entire adventure as a solstice gift for him, his
<b>Floyd</b> | eyes gleam with giddy admiration. You feel certain that he will
<b>Floyd</b> | recover soon to join you in all of your games and mischief as once
<b>Floyd</b> | before. Your mother brings out the meager solstice feast she had been
<b>Floyd</b> | saving, and all of you sit around the hearth to celebrate the final
<b>Floyd</b> | moments of this solstice night. Sander smiles with delight as you
<b>Floyd</b> | relate all of your incredible trials and adventures in the winter
<b>Floyd</b> | wonderland, and your parents exchange bewildered glances.

<b>Floyd</b> | land in front of the little spruce tree with a thud. Your parents
<b>Floyd</b> | carefully open the bag and dump out the contents. They nearly fall
<b>Floyd</b> | over in shock as gold pieces spill out onto the floor. You run to the
<b>Floyd</b> | window and poke your head outside. A damp breeze rustles your hair as
<b>Floyd</b> | you look to the east. You hear soft jingling bells among the distant
<b>Floyd</b> | clop of horse hoofs and are barely able to see a fading figure on a
<b>Floyd</b> | white horse disappear into the rising dawn.
