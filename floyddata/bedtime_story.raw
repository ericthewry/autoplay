The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript for two thirds of the 2008 IntroComp entries, in the following order: <i>Storm&nbsp;Cellar</i>, by P.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;Sheckarski; <I>Fiendish&nbsp;Zoo</I>, by Elizabeth&nbsp;Heller; <I>Bedtime&nbsp;Story</I>, by Taleslinger; and <I>The&nbsp;Bloody&nbsp;Guns</I>, by Stuart&nbsp;Allen.  These games were originally released as part of the 2008 IntroComp.  You can learn more about these games, including how to download them, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/IntroComp_2008"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

<b>Floyd</b> | hit you like a brick to the face. Randa was kind, understanding, then
<b>Floyd</b> | with her own soft determination beckoned you to get up from the sofa
<b>Floyd</b> | and put your son to bed. For a moment you gave in to the illusion that

<b>Floyd</b> | you're living the good life, making money, coming home to your family
<b>Floyd</b> | once the tie-up is completed. Then you realize you've been away for six
<b>Floyd</b> | months, a lifetime at his age. You look down on him, guilt in your
<b>Floyd</b> | stomach.
<b>Floyd</b> |  But then he smiles, the smile that always reminds Randa of you, and

<b>Floyd</b> | introduced Prince George, who is sent by king Sean to save some
<b>Floyd</b> | princess. (Even though Danny isn't yet old enough to get his head

<b>Floyd</b> | around the idea of wanting to save a girl.) Looks like the prince did a
<b>Floyd</b> | lot of traveling yesterday, saw a lot of landscape, did a lot of
<b>Floyd</b> | singing, and Danny fell asleep when he finally reached some bridge.
<b>Floyd</b> | Picking up there, you clear your throat and begin:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At the Bridge

<b>Floyd</b> | "The old, (once upon a time) sturdy wooden bridge had crossed the
<b>Floyd</b> | Clearwater River from east to west for as long as the prince could
<b>Floyd</b> | remember, and according to the stories, it had been there long before
<b>Floyd</b> | that, built when the kingdom was young. He fondly remembered hiding in
<b>Floyd</b> | the thick scrub below the bridge from his father's guards when he was
<b>Floyd</b> | but a boy. "

<b>Floyd</b> | DARWIN, AUSTRALIA
<b>Floyd</b> | SUNDAY 22 MARCH 1942
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The sun has almost risen above the tops of the gum trees at the far
<b>Floyd</b> | side of the field and it will soon be too hot to play cricket. From

<b>Floyd</b> | your position in the outfield you watch as Jenkins begins his loping
<b>Floyd</b> | stride towards the crease to deliver the final ball of the over. The
<b>Floyd</b> | other fielders, dressed only in khaki shorts, boots and wide brimmed
<b>Floyd</b> | hats stand stationary in the oppressive humidity. For a moment you
<b>Floyd</b> | think you can hear the faint throbbing drone of approaching aircraft,
<b>Floyd</b> | but then nothing. You tilt your head slightly, straining to hear then

<b>Floyd</b> | jump at the frantic clanging of the improvised air raid bell.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Man the bloody guns!" Sergeant Thompson yells as he drops his bat and
<b>Floyd</b> | lets Jenkins' ball run wide.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The players sprint from the field to the anti-aircraft gun mounted

<b>Floyd</b> | behind you at the western edge of the site as the sound of aircraft
<b>Floyd</b> | returns louder than before.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The worn leather cricket ball rolls to a stop near your feet.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The assembly area
<b>Floyd</b> | This flat, bare-earth area connects the four anti-aircraft guns. To the

<b>Floyd</b> | quarters for you and the rest of your crew. To the north, a path

<b>Floyd</b> | frame suspends an old oxygen cylinder just above a shallow pit in the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An iron bar used to strike the cylinder in order to raise the alarm is
