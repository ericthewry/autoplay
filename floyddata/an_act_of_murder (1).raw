The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>An Act of Murder</i> by Hugh Dunnett, a fictional character created by Christopher Huang.  <i>An Act of Murder</i> was originally released as part of the 2007 IF Competition, where it took second place.

You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/3041"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.

</BR></BR><B>A Special Note:</B> Unfortunately, the day we played <I>An Act of Murder</I>, we were having some trouble with Floyd, and he crashed three times.  This is an issue with Floyd, not the game.  I have included links which allow you to skip over any redundant commands we had to enter (sometimes quite a few) to catch up to where we were in the game prior to the crash.</BR></BR>

<b>Floyd</b> | FOREWORD
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The following story is set up with a great deal of randomisation, and
<b>Floyd</b> | is different each time you start or restart.  It would therefore be
<b>Floyd</b> | highly advisable to save the game before you even begin your
<b>Floyd</b> | investigation.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The story uses the basic "ask X about Y" format of speaking to other

<b>Floyd</b> | characters.  For the most part, "tell X about Y" will be unimportant:
<b>Floyd</b> | it is generally (though not always!) assumed that your questions about
<b>Floyd</b> | something will include asking about any new discoveries you have made
<b>Floyd</b> | elsewhere about the topic.  The main exception to this rule is when
<b>Floyd</b> | laying out your case before Chief Inspector Duffy: in that event, you
<b>Floyd</b> | will have to depend exclusively on "tell..." instead.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Time in the story proceeds at 15 seconds a turn, allowing you ample
<b>Floyd</b> | time (one hopes) to complete your investigation.  However, there is in
<b>Floyd</b> | fact a time limit: Chief Inspector Duffy will arrive to speak to you at
<b>Floyd</b> | 2:00 am; and, whatever time he arrives, he will eventually lose
<b>Floyd</b> | patience if you don't manage to make an arrest within a certain time of

<b>Floyd</b> | his arrival.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And that's all that's new.  Good luck, Inspector!  Your public awaits!

<b>Floyd</b> | "Frederic Sheppard." Chief Inspector Duffy pulls at his moustache

<b>Floyd</b> | mournfully and stares up at the house through the windshield.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Theatrical sort, usually has a finger in some play or other. He bought
<b>Floyd</b> | up Gull Point about ten years ago. Never any complaints from the
<b>Floyd</b> | neighbours, never any scandals." He pulls at his moustache again. "He
<b>Floyd</b> | was found dead in the cove at the foot of the cliff behind the house
<b>Floyd</b> | about half an hour ago. Caller said it looked as though he fell from

<b>Floyd</b> | his study window."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Think he might have jumped?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "She's your investigation: you tell me. We're treating this as a murder
<b>Floyd</b> | unless you can find anything to prove otherwise."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You nod. As you get out of the car, the Chief Inspector yawns and says,
<b>Floyd</b> | "All right. I'm heading back to HQ. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
<b>Floyd</b> | The investigation's all yours. And if at any time you think you're
<b>Floyd</b> | ready to make an arrest, give me a call first, got it?"
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Got it."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What a wonderful way to spend the night. As Chief Inspector Duffy
<b>Floyd</b> | drives off into the darkness, you check your watch to see just how late
<b>Floyd</b> | it really is -- only to find that your watch has stopped.

<b>Floyd</b> | attractive, with steel-frame glasses. Her manner is cool and aloof; if
<b>Floyd</b> | she is at all disturbed by the current situation, she's hiding it well.
<b>Floyd</b> | She looks you up and down through clear blue eyes before speaking.

<b>Floyd</b> | "This is hardly the time to be playing the fool, Inspector. Now please,
<b>Floyd</b> | come in."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Entrance Foyer
<b>Floyd</b> | Theatrical bills on the walls give this otherwise sterile entry hall
<b>Floyd</b> | the appearance of a theatrical lobby. The front doors are to the north,
<b>Floyd</b> | and the central hall is to the south. The cloak room is to the east.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "My name is Deborah Wolf, by the way. Frederic Sheppard was my uncle.
<b>Floyd</b> | My husband and I just arrived today to spend the weekend...." She
<b>Floyd</b> | shakes her head. "I'm sorry. It has all been a terrible shock. Please,
<b>Floyd</b> | come this way."

<b>Floyd</b> | musical called Twisty Passages, with a friend, Elinor Lamb. They were
<b>Floyd</b> | going to spend the weekend here, working on it together."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Just as you pass under the arch into the central hall, the grandfather
<b>Floyd</b> | clock by the stairs chimes the midnight hour in doleful tones.
<b>Floyd</b> | Wonderful.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Central Hall
<b>Floyd</b> | The central hall is a two-storeyed room, with wide arches north,
<b>Floyd</b> | northwest, southeast and east. French doors to the south open into the
<b>Floyd</b> | library, and a flight of stairs leads upstairs. The kitchen is through
<b>Floyd</b> | a discreet little door to the west. High above, the night sky is

<b>Floyd</b> | visible through a vast skylight.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Deborah Wolf is here, watching you attentively.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Loud, ponderous ticking echoes from the grandfather clock by the
<b>Floyd</b> | stairs.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The hall telephone stands in its niche beneath the stairs like an
<b>Floyd</b> | inscrutable modern art sculpture.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you set your watch and wind it up, a tall, slender young man emerges
<b>Floyd</b> | from the drawing room to the east. "Ah," he drawls, "the illustrious

<b>Floyd</b> | representative of the Law. How perfectly delightful." He looks down at
<b>Floyd</b> | you with a vaguely supercilious manner.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Deborah Wolf makes the introductions. "Inspector, this is Mr Benedict
<b>Floyd</b> | Lamb, Elinor Lamb's brother. As I mentioned, Miss Lamb is collaborating
<b>Floyd</b> | with my husband on a stage musical; and Benedict here is acting

<b>Floyd</b> | Library

<b>Floyd</b> | The study door to the west is almost obscured by the near-solid screen

<b>Floyd</b> | FOREWORD
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The following story is set up with a great deal of randomisation, and
<b>Floyd</b> | is different each time you start or restart.  It would therefore be
<b>Floyd</b> | highly advisable to save the game before you even begin your
<b>Floyd</b> | investigation.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The story uses the basic "ask X about Y" format of speaking to other
<b>Floyd</b> | characters.  For the most part, "tell X about Y" will be unimportant:
<b>Floyd</b> | it is generally (though not always!) assumed that your questions about
<b>Floyd</b> | something will include asking about any new discoveries you have made
<b>Floyd</b> | elsewhere about the topic.  The main exception to this rule is when

<b>Floyd</b> | laying out your case before Chief Inspector Duffy: in that event, you
<b>Floyd</b> | will have to depend exclusively on "tell..." instead.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Time in the story proceeds at 15 seconds a turn, allowing you ample
<b>Floyd</b> | time (one hopes) to complete your investigation.  However, there is in
<b>Floyd</b> | fact a time limit: Chief Inspector Duffy will arrive to speak to you at

<b>Floyd</b> | 2:00 am; and, whatever time he arrives, he will eventually lose
<b>Floyd</b> | patience if you don't manage to make an arrest within a certain time of

<b>Floyd</b> | "Frederic Sheppard." Chief Inspector Duffy pulls at his moustache
<b>Floyd</b> | mournfully and stares up at the house through the windshield.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Theatrical sort, usually has a finger in some play or other. He bought
<b>Floyd</b> | up Gull Point about ten years ago. Never any complaints from the
<b>Floyd</b> | neighbours, never any scandals." He pulls at his moustache again. "He
<b>Floyd</b> | was found dead in the cove at the foot of the cliff behind the house

<b>Floyd</b> | about half an hour ago. Caller said it looked as though he fell from
<b>Floyd</b> | his study window."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Think he might have jumped?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "She's your investigation: you tell me. We're treating this as a murder

<b>Floyd</b> | unless you can find anything to prove otherwise."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You nod. As you get out of the car, the Chief Inspector yawns and says,
<b>Floyd</b> | "All right. I'm heading back to HQ. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
<b>Floyd</b> | The investigation's all yours. And if at any time you think you're
<b>Floyd</b> | ready to make an arrest, give me a call first, got it?"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Got it."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What a wonderful way to spend the night. As Chief Inspector Duffy
<b>Floyd</b> | drives off into the darkness, you check your watch to see just how late
<b>Floyd</b> | it really is -- only to find that your watch has stopped.

<b>Floyd</b> | going to spend the weekend here, working on it together."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Just as you pass under the arch into the central hall, the grandfather
<b>Floyd</b> | clock by the stairs chimes the midnight hour in doleful tones.
<b>Floyd</b> | Wonderful.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Central Hall
<b>Floyd</b> | The central hall is a two-storeyed room, with wide arches north,
<b>Floyd</b> | northwest, southeast and east. French doors to the south open into the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Deborah Wolf is here, watching you attentively.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Loud, ponderous ticking echoes from the grandfather clock by the

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The hall telephone stands in its niche beneath the stairs like an

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you set your watch and wind it up, a tall, slender young man emerges
<b>Floyd</b> | from the drawing room to the east. "Ah," he drawls, "the illustrious
<b>Floyd</b> | representative of the Law. How perfectly delightful." He looks down at

<b>Floyd</b> | you with a vaguely supercilious manner.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Deborah Wolf makes the introductions. "Inspector, this is Mr Benedict
<b>Floyd</b> | Lamb, Elinor Lamb's brother. As I mentioned, Miss Lamb is collaborating

<b>Floyd</b> | Library

<b>Floyd</b> | The study door to the west is almost obscured by the near-solid screen
<b>Floyd</b> | of crowded bookshelves occupying the west wall. The rest of the room is
<b>Floyd</b> | occupied with modern art. French doors open north to the central hall

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Deborah Wolf is here, watching you attentively.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On closer inspection, one piece of modern art turns out to actually be
<b>Floyd</b> | a clock.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can also see a tide table here.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A short, red-headed young man is bent over a leather briefcase as you
<b>Floyd</b> | enter the Library. He looks up, startled, as you come in, and hurriedly
<b>Floyd</b> | shuts the briefcase. Then he's all smiles and cheerful camaraderie as
<b>Floyd</b> | he tosses his briefcase into a corner and comes forward to shake your
<b>Floyd</b> | hand.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Inspector," says Deborah, "I'd like you to meet Mr Cedric Crane, my
<b>Floyd</b> | uncle's former accountant. He was the one -- along with Mr Lamb -- who
<b>Floyd</b> | discovered the crime and raised the alarm."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Cedric Crane pumps your arm with all the excessive energy of a

<b>Floyd</b> | campaigning politician. Close up, you realise that he must actually be
<b>Floyd</b> | quite a bit older than he appeared at first glance. "A pleasure to make

<b>Floyd</b> | Drawing Room
<b>Floyd</b> | The drawing room is a study in contrasts. The walls are very white, and
<b>Floyd</b> | there is a modern-looking fireplace in the middle of the north wall;

<b>Floyd</b> | drawing room furniture one can imagine. Wide arches go west to the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An oversized carriage clock sits on the fireplace mantle.

<b>Floyd</b> | FOREWORD
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The following story is set up with a great deal of randomisation, and
<b>Floyd</b> | is different each time you start or restart.  It would therefore be
<b>Floyd</b> | highly advisable to save the game before you even begin your

<b>Floyd</b> | investigation.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The story uses the basic "ask X about Y" format of speaking to other
<b>Floyd</b> | characters.  For the most part, "tell X about Y" will be unimportant:
<b>Floyd</b> | it is generally (though not always!) assumed that your questions about
<b>Floyd</b> | something will include asking about any new discoveries you have made

<b>Floyd</b> | elsewhere about the topic.  The main exception to this rule is when
<b>Floyd</b> | laying out your case before Chief Inspector Duffy: in that event, you
<b>Floyd</b> | will have to depend exclusively on "tell..." instead.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Time in the story proceeds at 15 seconds a turn, allowing you ample
<b>Floyd</b> | time (one hopes) to complete your investigation.  However, there is in

<b>Floyd</b> | fact a time limit: Chief Inspector Duffy will arrive to speak to you at
<b>Floyd</b> | 2:00 am; and, whatever time he arrives, he will eventually lose
<b>Floyd</b> | patience if you don't manage to make an arrest within a certain time of
<b>Floyd</b> | his arrival.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And that's all that's new.  Good luck, Inspector!  Your public awaits!

<b>Floyd</b> | "Frederic Sheppard." Chief Inspector Duffy pulls at his moustache
<b>Floyd</b> | mournfully and stares up at the house through the windshield.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Theatrical sort, usually has a finger in some play or other. He bought
<b>Floyd</b> | up Gull Point about ten years ago. Never any complaints from the
<b>Floyd</b> | neighbours, never any scandals." He pulls at his moustache again. "He

<b>Floyd</b> | was found dead in the cove at the foot of the cliff behind the house
<b>Floyd</b> | about half an hour ago. Caller said it looked as though he fell from
<b>Floyd</b> | his study window."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Think he might have jumped?"
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "She's your investigation: you tell me. We're treating this as a murder
<b>Floyd</b> | unless you can find anything to prove otherwise."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You nod. As you get out of the car, the Chief Inspector yawns and says,
<b>Floyd</b> | "All right. I'm heading back to HQ. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
<b>Floyd</b> | The investigation's all yours. And if at any time you think you're

<b>Floyd</b> | ready to make an arrest, give me a call first, got it?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Got it."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What a wonderful way to spend the night. As Chief Inspector Duffy
<b>Floyd</b> | drives off into the darkness, you check your watch to see just how late

<b>Floyd</b> | it really is -- only to find that your watch has stopped.

<b>Floyd</b> | Front Drive
<b>Floyd</b> | You are standing on the front drive of Gull Point, residence of noted
<b>Floyd</b> | theatrical patron Frederic Sheppard. The house, a rambling old place,
<b>Floyd</b> | stands to the south.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Beside the front doors, the large doorbell button gleams amber in the
<b>Floyd</b> | moonlight.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can also see a red Triumph Roadster, a blue Austin and a green

<b>Floyd</b> | FOREWORD
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The following story is set up with a great deal of randomisation, and
<b>Floyd</b> | is different each time you start or restart.  It would therefore be
<b>Floyd</b> | highly advisable to save the game before you even begin your
<b>Floyd</b> | investigation.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The story uses the basic "ask X about Y" format of speaking to other

<b>Floyd</b> | characters.  For the most part, "tell X about Y" will be unimportant:
<b>Floyd</b> | it is generally (though not always!) assumed that your questions about
<b>Floyd</b> | something will include asking about any new discoveries you have made
<b>Floyd</b> | elsewhere about the topic.  The main exception to this rule is when
<b>Floyd</b> | laying out your case before Chief Inspector Duffy: in that event, you
<b>Floyd</b> | will have to depend exclusively on "tell..." instead.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Time in the story proceeds at 15 seconds a turn, allowing you ample
<b>Floyd</b> | time (one hopes) to complete your investigation.  However, there is in
<b>Floyd</b> | fact a time limit: Chief Inspector Duffy will arrive to speak to you at
<b>Floyd</b> | 2:00 am; and, whatever time he arrives, he will eventually lose
<b>Floyd</b> | patience if you don't manage to make an arrest within a certain time of

<b>Floyd</b> | his arrival.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And that's all that's new.  Good luck, Inspector!  Your public awaits!

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Frederic Sheppard." Chief Inspector Duffy pulls at his moustache
<b>Floyd</b> | mournfully and stares up at the house through the windshield.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Theatrical sort, usually has a finger in some play or other. He bought
<b>Floyd</b> | up Gull Point about ten years ago. Never any complaints from the
<b>Floyd</b> | neighbours, never any scandals." He pulls at his moustache again. "He
<b>Floyd</b> | was found dead in the cove at the foot of the cliff behind the house
<b>Floyd</b> | about half an hour ago. Caller said it looked as though he fell from
<b>Floyd</b> | his study window."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Think he might have jumped?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "She's your investigation: you tell me. We're treating this as a murder
<b>Floyd</b> | unless you can find anything to prove otherwise."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You nod. As you get out of the car, the Chief Inspector yawns and says,
<b>Floyd</b> | "All right. I'm heading back to HQ. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
<b>Floyd</b> | The investigation's all yours. And if at any time you think you're
<b>Floyd</b> | ready to make an arrest, give me a call first, got it?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Got it."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What a wonderful way to spend the night. As Chief Inspector Duffy
<b>Floyd</b> | drives off into the darkness, you check your watch to see just how late
<b>Floyd</b> | it really is -- only to find that your watch has stopped.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Front Drive
<b>Floyd</b> | You are standing on the front drive of Gull Point, residence of noted

<b>Floyd</b> | theatrical patron Frederic Sheppard. The house, a rambling old place,
<b>Floyd</b> | stands to the south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Beside the front doors, the large doorbell button gleams amber in the
<b>Floyd</b> | moonlight.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You can also see a red Triumph Roadster, a blue Austin and a green
<b>Floyd</b> | Morris Saloon here.

<b>Floyd</b> | Chief Inspector Duffy reaches for his notebook and begins jotting down

<b>Floyd</b> | time before 9:15 pm ... give it another ten minutes; I'd say 9:25 pm
<b>Floyd</b> | would be the very latest that the body could have gone into the water."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Chief Inspector Duffy compares his notes. "Well, that clears two of our
<b>Floyd</b> | suspects, at least: Benedict Lamb and Alexander Wolf appear to have
<b>Floyd</b> | alibis for the small window of opportunity in between Frederic
<b>Floyd</b> | Sheppard's telephone call, when he was last known to be alive, and the
<b>Floyd</b> | time at which he must have gone into the water. And if they're

<b>Floyd</b> | Cedric Crane is still playing pool with Alexander Wolf when you find
<b>Floyd</b> | him, leaning across the table for a difficult shot. He looks up as you
<b>Floyd</b> | approach. "I was wondering when you'd come for me," he says.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You read out the charges and are about to cuff him when Alexander
<b>Floyd</b> | suddenly roars, "Murder AND embezzlement? You bastard! You're the

<b>Floyd</b> | reason Fred wanted to bail on us!" Alexander vaults over the table -- a
<b>Floyd</b> | surprising feat for a man his size -- and it is all you and Chief
<b>Floyd</b> | Inspector Duffy can do to keep him from tearing Cedric Crane apart
<b>Floyd</b> | right there.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The commotion draws the attention of all the other former suspects.

<b>Floyd</b> | Deborah, looking triumphant in the doorway of the library, says, "I
<b>Floyd</b> | told you he was a dishonest man."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Cedric glares at her. "Damn you. It's your own fault -- if you hadn't
<b>Floyd</b> | tipped the old man off, we might have gone on for years. As it was,
<b>Floyd</b> | engineering this little farce was the last chance I had, given the

<b>Floyd</b> | short notice. Shoving the old bastard out the window was child's play;
<b>Floyd</b> | and Mr Lamb played right into my hands when he suggested we walk out
<b>Floyd</b> | towards the rocks.... I would have gotten rid of that confounded
<b>Floyd</b> | ledger, too, but I couldn't find it. I suppose you had it all along and
<b>Floyd</b> | left it lying conveniently on Mr Sheppard's desk for the police to
<b>Floyd</b> | find."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Deborah says, "Of course I did. When I saw the state of the study, I
<b>Floyd</b> | guessed what had happened, and took steps accordingly." She turns to
<b>Floyd</b> | you. "Take him away, Inspector. I hope you put him away for a very,
<b>Floyd</b> | very long time."
