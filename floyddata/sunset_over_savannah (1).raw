The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Sunset Over Savannah</i>, written by Ivan&nbsp;Cockrum.  <i>Sunset Over Savannah</i> was originally released as part of the 1997 IF Comp, where it took sixth place. You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Sunset_Over_Savannah"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

<b>Floyd</b> | Sunset Over Savannah
<b>Floyd</b> | by Ivan Cockrum
<b>Floyd</b> | Contest Release 1.0, 9/30/97.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You follow the sand-strewn brick beach path for the last time, your
<b>Floyd</b> | thoughts a jumble of pleasant memories and angst-filled anticipation.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The past week has been a formless, blissful oasis of peace in your
<b>Floyd</b> | otherwise hectic, demanding life.  You spent it alternately exploring
<b>Floyd</b> | the cool shade of historic downtown Savannah and basking in the warm
<b>Floyd</b> | southern sun.  Today is the last day of your vacation and the sun is
<b>Floyd</b> | setting fast, painting the sky with a breathtaking palette of pastel

<b>Floyd</b> | colors.  Tomorrow you'll be back in the office:  answering phones,
<b>Floyd</b> | writing memos, and painfully plotting every moment of your waking life
<b>Floyd</b> | for the next month.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This short liberty has given you an unexpected sense of perspective on
<b>Floyd</b> | your life.  You've decided that you hate your job.  Though the

<b>Floyd</b> | realization came as no surprise, you were slightly shocked to discover
<b>Floyd</b> | exactly how much you hate your job.  It's not so much the work itself,
<b>Floyd</b> | as the way it's slowly, subtly insinuated itself into your soul.  It
<b>Floyd</b> | fills your thoughts and subverts your energies.  You feel you haven't
<b>Floyd</b> | created anything decent in months, possibly even years.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | In fact, you're of half a mind to quit.  You've got enough cash in the
<b>Floyd</b> | bank for an extended vacation, and with your skills, finding work will
<b>Floyd</b> | never be an issue.  You could even dedicate some time to pursuing your
<b>Floyd</b> | creative interests.  The only real obstacles are your own inertia and
<b>Floyd</b> | an overblown sense of loyalty that goes unreciprocated anyway.  It
<b>Floyd</b> | feels like all you'd need is a little more convincing that there's

<b>Floyd</b> | something more to life than constant, mind-numbing labor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Caught as you are between reverie and dread, you barely notice as your
<b>Floyd</b> | freshly callused feet carry you to the foot of the boardwalk...

<b>Floyd</b> | Beach Path
<b>Floyd</b> | The brick beach path ends at the foot of a cement stairway that leads

<b>Floyd</b> | east to the Tybrisa Pavilion.  To the northeast and southeast, twin
<b>Floyd</b> | boardwalks wrap around the pavilion towards the beach.  By one of the
<b>Floyd</b> | boardwalks is a simple public shower, while a white diving bell stands
<b>Floyd</b> | near the entrance of a small building to the northwest.  Your hotel
<b>Floyd</b> | towers back to the west, obscuring the sunset.
<b>Floyd</b> |    A sign advertising boiled peanuts points east, into the pavilion.

<b>Floyd</b> |    You see a clam shell here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your stomach grumbles at the sight of the boiled peanut sign.  You
<b>Floyd</b> | realize that, in your agitated state, you've completely forgotten to
<b>Floyd</b> | eat dinner.

<b>Floyd</b> | You're standing in the center of a colossal gazebo that provides shade

<b>Floyd</b> | unbroken grey concrete, bordered on each face by a waist high railing.

<b>Floyd</b> | Tall beams support a sloping wooden canopy that rises over three times
<b>Floyd</b> | your height.  A red brick enclosure squats in the southwest corner and
<b>Floyd</b> | a small snack bar nestles up against the enclosure to the south.  To
<b>Floyd</b> | the east lies the foot of a seemingly endless pier.  A number of
<b>Floyd</b> | wooden benches sit along the north face of the pavilion.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The snack bar must be what the sign on the stairs was pointing to.

<b>Floyd</b> | A quaint little snack bar nestles beside the brick enclosure, while

<b>Floyd</b> | sign above the counter advertises boiled peanuts.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Behind the counter is an industrial boiler.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Behind the counter, a vendor is busily locking things away for the
<b>Floyd</b> | night.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | the night.  Another few minutes and I woulda tossed 'em."  He takes a

<b>Floyd</b> | pot holder from beneath the counter and uses it to grab a wireframe
<b>Floyd</b> | sieve resting in the boiler.  He bends over the boiler, and as he
<b>Floyd</b> | does, a small steel key slides out of his shirt pocket and falls into
<b>Floyd</b> | the bubbling water.  Using the sieve, he scoops up the bobbing
<b>Floyd</b> | peanuts.  He waits a moment while the sieve drains, and then dumps the

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | This southern delicacy is still something of an oddity to you.  Some
<b>Floyd</b> | locals actually eat the entire peanut, husk and all.  Never one to
<b>Floyd</b> | pass up a new experience, you pluck a peanut from the sack and pop it
<b>Floyd</b> | into your mouth.  The husk crunches soggily between your teeth,

<b>Floyd</b> | revealing the pulpy fruit inside.  You queazily suspect that a large
<b>Floyd</b> | bug would share the same texture.  But despite that...  it doesn't
<b>Floyd</b> | taste bad.  In fact, boiled, the peanuts taste a lot like black eyed
<b>Floyd</b> | peas.  You try another, this time removing the husk.  Yes, it's quite
<b>Floyd</b> | tasty, so you eat a few more.  They're so rich though, that it doesn't
<b>Floyd</b> | take many at all to quell your hunger.  Thankfully, your stomach has

<b>Floyd</b> | stopped its rumbling, and there are still plenty of peanuts left in
<b>Floyd</b> | the sack.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The vendor bends down and slams a cupboard somewhere behind the
<b>Floyd</b> | counter.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Suddenly, the vendor pulls a white plastic bucket from beneath the
<b>Floyd</b> | counter.  To your surprise, he spills it out over the railing before
<b>Floyd</b> | locking it away again.  "Ah, just about done," he says to no one in
<b>Floyd</b> | particular.  "Just have to dump the peanut water and I'm outta here."
<b>Floyd</b> | He grabs the sieve from the boiler and sets it on the counter.  "Hey,
<b>Floyd</b> | would you lend me a hand here?  I'd really appreciate it."

<b>Floyd</b> | "Thanks!"  With your help, the vendor lifts the boiler pan off its

<b>Floyd</b> | there?"  In an aside to you he says "Don't worry, we only toss out

<b>Floyd</b> | stuff that's edible.  It all gets eaten by the birds and the crabs.
<b>Floyd</b> | Everything else goes to the dump or gets recycled."  He turns back to
<b>Floyd</b> | the railing and, having received no response from below, yells "Ok,
<b>Floyd</b> | boiling water coming down!"  and leads you in tipping out the boiler.
<b>Floyd</b> | The boiling water cascades down into the sand, filling the air with
<b>Floyd</b> | billowing clouds of steam.  Then, the vendor sets the empty boiling

<b>Floyd</b> | pan back on its base and folds down the lid.  He reaches beneath the

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | With great trepidation, you set one foot on the lowest part of the
<b>Floyd</b> | spiral ramp. It supports your weight.  You try the other foot.  When
<b>Floyd</b> | the ramp fails to collapse, you start climbing, slowly, carefully,
<b>Floyd</b> | leaning on the nearby towers for support.  Thank goodness for the blue
<b>Floyd</b> | plastic sheets inlaid in the ramp.  Without them, the glassy surface
<b>Floyd</b> | would be far too slick to climb.  You circle the castle once, twice,

<b>Floyd</b> | three times, four, all the while looking nervously up at the needle
<b>Floyd</b> | sharp spires.  Eventually, the ramp becomes too narrow for you to
<b>Floyd</b> | continue any further.  But, by bracing one foot against the topmost
<b>Floyd</b> | spire and standing on the toes of the other, you can just reach the
<b>Floyd</b> | pipes above.  You reach for the shining object and...  Ahh!  Your foot
<b>Floyd</b> | glides off the glossy spire and you fall to your behind on the ramp.

<b>Floyd</b> | Gravity takes over and sends you sliding down the ramp, rear end
<b>Floyd</b> | scraping blue plastic through turn after turn.  Finally, you slide
<b>Floyd</b> | into the sand at the base of the castle, unharmed.  Wow!  What a trip!
<b>Floyd</b> | Only then do you discover that you succeeded in pulling down the
<b>Floyd</b> | reflective object, because you've still got it clenched tightly in
<b>Floyd</b> | your white knuckled fist.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You examine the object to discover that you've retrieved a black
<b>Floyd</b> | banded scuba mask.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Pavilion
<b>Floyd</b> | You're standing in the center of a colossal gazebo that provides shade
<b>Floyd</b> | for sunburned tourists like yourself.  The octagonal floor is made of
<b>Floyd</b> | unbroken grey concrete, bordered on each face by a waist high railing.
<b>Floyd</b> | Tall beams support a sloping wooden canopy that rises over three times

<b>Floyd</b> | your height.  A red brick enclosure squats in the southwest corner and
<b>Floyd</b> | a small snack bar nestles up against the enclosure to the south.  To
<b>Floyd</b> | the east lies the foot of a seemingly endless pier.  A number of
<b>Floyd</b> | wooden benches sit along the north face of the pavilion.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The light of the setting sun warms your back as you exit the shade of

<b>Floyd</b> | the pavilion and begin the long stroll down the pier.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Middle of Pier
<b>Floyd</b> | The pier is even longer than it looked.  It stretches back west to the
<b>Floyd</b> | great pavilion and continues still further east towards the sea.  A
<b>Floyd</b> | small shelter rests at the far end.  From below, you can hear the

<b>Floyd</b> | fizzle and hiss of the shallow surf.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A speck of sunlight glints off a ship lying far off on the eastern
<b>Floyd</b> | horizon.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust to the shade beneath the

<b>Floyd</b> | small shelter.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | End of Pier
<b>Floyd</b> | The pier ends here in a small rectangular shelter with a low wooden
<b>Floyd</b> | roof.  You imagine that, seen from overhead, it would look like a
<b>Floyd</b> | pendulum hung from the face of the pavilion.  The railing surrounds

<b>Floyd</b> | you on all sides but to the west, where you can follow the pier back
<b>Floyd</b> | towards the pavilion.  A water fountain is tucked in one corner.
<b>Floyd</b> |    You see a strapless pair of goggles, an antique bottle, a cork, a
<b>Floyd</b> | treasure map, a white rubber strap, and a shrimp here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An old man is fishing off the pier with a great, heavy rod.  Resting

<b>Floyd</b> | on the railing beside him is an open tackle box, while at his feet sit
<b>Floyd</b> | a bucket full of freshly caught fish and an empty burlap sack.

<b>Floyd</b> | You come awake groggily, with pounding head.  You seem to be lying on
<b>Floyd</b> | your side in the cold and damp.  You try to sit up, but your arms are

<b>Floyd</b> | somehow pinned behind you.  In fact, it feels like they're tied down.
<b>Floyd</b> | You can even feel a coarse rope tied roughly around you.  Your eyes
<b>Floyd</b> | are gummed shut, but you force them open and take in your surroundings
<b>Floyd</b> | with blurred vision.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can't even begin to imagine how, but you've come to be lying in

<b>Floyd</b> | some sort of underground grotto.  The walls and ceiling are of rough
<b>Floyd</b> | stone, and water drips from the ceiling and puddles around you on the
<b>Floyd</b> | stony floor.  A cool breeze on your back suggests that the cavern
<b>Floyd</b> | extends to some distance behind you.  Nearby, a thin, sandy shore
<b>Floyd</b> | descends towards a sheltered inlet.  The inlet follows the cove as it
<b>Floyd</b> | bends out of sight towards the sea, while pink tongues of sunset reach

<b>Floyd</b> | back around the bend to lick the dark walls of the cave.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You look around to find the elderly couple you've seen strolling the
<b>Floyd</b> | beach, looking down at you concernedly.

<b>Floyd</b> |    "We heard you shout," says the woman.  Seeing the look of confusion
<b>Floyd</b> | on your face, she says "When the sand fell in on you."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "We pulled you out," says the man.  "What were you doing, digging
<b>Floyd</b> | so deeply, anyway?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Oh, it doesn't matter," says she.  "What's important is that

<b>Floyd</b> |    You nod your head, yes.  "Thank you."  The words burn in your

<b>Floyd</b> |    You shake your head in the negative.  "Thanks, I'll be fine."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Well, all right, dear.  But do try to be more careful!"  And with

<b>Floyd</b> | that, the elderly couple strolls away to the east, throwing an
<b>Floyd</b> | occasional concerned glance back your way.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thank goodness, all the pain and grogginess you felt lying in the
<b>Floyd</b> | grotto has disappeared as if it never was.  Nevertheless, all the
<b>Floyd</b> | digging and the subsequent near burial has left you winded.  You rest

<b>Floyd</b> | for a moment, taking stock of...  what?  Was it a vision?  Past life
<b>Floyd</b> | experience?  Suddenly, the word 'shanghaied' pops into your head.
<b>Floyd</b> | You're reminded of your visit to Savannah's famed Pirate House.
<b>Floyd</b> | According to city history, honest-to-goodness pirates frequented the
<b>Floyd</b> | place in the buccaneering days of Savannah's past, largely for
<b>Floyd</b> | convenient access to the caves beneath the tavern.  These underground

<b>Floyd</b> | caverns connected the Pirate House to nearby River Street.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | brigands frequently took advantage of these caverns in order to
<b>Floyd</b> | discreetly carry drunken 'new recruits' out to their ships.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | hapless abductees would later wake to find themselves miles from
<b>Floyd</b> | shore, with no recourse but to join the ship's crew.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Of course, that still doesn't begin to explain your strange
<b>Floyd</b> | experience.  It's reminded you that the true "treasures" are life and
<b>Floyd</b> | freedom.  But suddenly, you recall frighteningly similar nightmares
<b>Floyd</b> | where you were locked into eternal servitude by your slavish job.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | realization jolts you back to your ongoing internal debate.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You're feeling hesitant.  "Well now, wait a minute," is what you're
<b>Floyd</b> | now thinking.  What's life about if not living?  And much as you hate
<b>Floyd</b> | to admit it, your employers can probably replace you easily.  You're
<b>Floyd</b> | still not quite decided, but it would only take several more arguments
<b>Floyd</b> | to set your mind.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |    You see an aluminum recycling canister, a scuba mask, a treasure
<b>Floyd</b> | map, a shingle, a crowbar, and a white rubber strap here.
<b>Floyd</b> |    The white rubber strap dangles limply from the crowbar.

<b>Floyd</b> | their convoluted folds home to tiny, salmon colored shrimp.  Larger

<b>Floyd</b> | wheel and twirl.  Fluted ivory branches climb surface ward, reaching
<b>Floyd</b> | like grasping fingers for the silver fish that dart among them.  And

<b>Floyd</b> | which wave majestically in the currents as if bestowing grace upon

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Discovering all this at such great depth and so far north is nothing

<b>Floyd</b> | becoming more substantial as they spin and whirl in their gossamer

<b>Floyd</b> | wing tips and slippers.  Petticoats twirl about you as the ladies
<b>Floyd</b> | wearing them prance and pirouette, lead by gentlemen in high collared,

<b>Floyd</b> | Tall beams support a sloping wooden canopy that rises over three times

<b>Floyd</b> | a small snack bar nestles up against the enclosure to the south.  To

<b>Floyd</b> |    There are numerous wooden benches here.  Right now, they're
<b>Floyd</b> | stacked, one on top of another, into a towering wooden column twice

<b>Floyd</b> | The old man seems reluctantly to be packing his gear away.  He's

<b>Floyd</b> | he draws a large folding blade from his hip pocket and proceeds to gut
<b>Floyd</b> | his catch.  He takes each fish in turn from the pail and deftly
<b>Floyd</b> | decapitates it, slits it lengthwise, strips out the viscera, and
<b>Floyd</b> | sweeps the offal into the sea.  Once done, he wraps each fish in

<b>Floyd</b> | awakening.  The ripple rebounds from the tail and shudders back up the

<b>Floyd</b> | spine, growing in force and velocity until it disappears into the base
<b>Floyd</b> | of the creature's skull.  Then, slowly, lazily, the eyes open as if
<b>Floyd</b> | from a long, restful sleep.  Suddenly the head darts forward, causing
<b>Floyd</b> | you to leap back, fearful of an attack.  But the creature is merely
<b>Floyd</b> | stretching its long, sinuous neck.  Its angular head splits open in a
<b>Floyd</b> | great, toothy yawn that sends you peddling still further back.  Then,

<b>Floyd</b> | elephantine roar that rattles your bones and sends every gull in the

<b>Floyd</b> | with a loud crack that echoes out over the water like gunshot.

<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, the great, sandy beast glances around the beach, tightens the

<b>Floyd</b> | In an instant, it is airborne, beating the air with mighty strokes of

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You recall that it was penned by Richard Henry Wilde.  It was inspired
