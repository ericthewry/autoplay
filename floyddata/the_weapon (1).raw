The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>The Weapon</i>, written by Sean&nbsp;Barrett.  <i>The Weapon</i> was originally released in 2001.  It received two XYZZY nominations, one for Best Puzzles, and one for Best Individual NPC. You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/1390"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.</br>

So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | You pass the sentry watching the doorway to the Yi control room,
<b>Floyd</b> | hardly aware of his presence, and step inside, stopping before the
<b>Floyd</b> | owner of the familiar, frowning face just inside. Your escorts come to
<b>Floyd</b> | a halt behind you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Tolan," the tall, wiry woman says to you.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You steel yourself for the need to speak. "Cheryl," you reply. "Dig
<b>Floyd</b> | Leader Cheryl Thadafel. I knew you would have need of the greatest
<b>Floyd</b> | Mechanist in the galaxy. Again." The longest speech ever to cross
<b>Floyd</b> | these lips?
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Tolan, this is going to be on my terms, or not at all."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You turn your empty hands face-up. "Cheryl, this is important to me.
<b>Floyd</b> | It is the Yi-Lono-Mordel. Whatever the restrictions, I cannot miss
<b>Floyd</b> | this opportunity."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Especially if the restrictions required you be kept away from it.
<b>Floyd</b> | Enough. I don't have much else to work with here, do I?" As she
<b>Floyd</b> | dismisses the guards, you sweep your eyes about the room.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Again.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | This time you will pull it off--regardless of Cheryl's desires.

<b>Floyd</b> | Most humans would probably find it the height of fashion, but this low
<b>Floyd</b> | ellipsoidal room makes you uncomfortable with its perfect symmetry and
<b>Floyd</b> | sterility. The featureless white wall is broken up only by the large
<b>Floyd</b> | elliptical window in the ceiling and the circular doorway through

<b>Floyd</b> | which you entered. A cluster of forms sits in the center, atop the
<b>Floyd</b> | slightly concave floor.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | knows, even tiny objects which are unlikely to have traditional

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The only other significant deviation of this game from typical
<b>Floyd</b> | interactive fiction is in communication with other characters:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | TALK TO character; TALK; T    Respond to another character's
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation
<b>Floyd</b> | ASK character FOR object      Ask a character to supply you with an

<b>Floyd</b> | object
<b>Floyd</b> | character, EAT FOOD           Ask a character to do something specific
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If someone threatens to incapacitate you if you don't do as they tell
<b>Floyd</b> | you, take the threat seriously. You can always UNDO if things do go
<b>Floyd</b> | wrong; the game prevents you from taking actions that would require

<b>Floyd</b> | more than one UNDO to recover from--that is, actions that put the game
<b>Floyd</b> | in an unwinnable state.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hints and credits are available by typing HINT.
