					<p class="leftalign">
					<span class="fontish smaller">The idea behind ClubFloyd
						is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of 
						people meet online to cooperatively play a game of 
						interactive fiction.<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Sting of the Wasp</em> written by Jason Devlin.
						<I>Sting of the Wasp</I> was originally released as part of the 2004 Interactive Fiction Competition, in which it took fourth place.  It went on to win Xyzzy Awards for Best NPCs and Best Individual PC (for Julia).

					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing this game, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never

<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh, Julia! Where did you learn that?" Keith whispers breathlessly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | All tongue and fingers, he kisses the milky skin above your breasts,
<b>Floyd</b> | while your hands slide their way up and down his sculpted chest, so
<b>Floyd</b> | eager with lust that your watch occasionally snags on a stray chest
<b>Floyd</b> | hair. Your lips, glistening like two fresh strawberries laced with dew,
<b>Floyd</b> | hungrily roam across his neck. And your hips! Well, that's better left
<b>Floyd</b> | to the imagination.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Normally, you wouldn't even consider seeing Keith at Pine Meadows, but
<b>Floyd</b> | Frank's in Boston and won't be back until tonight's banquet.  And when
<b>Floyd</b> | the cat's away...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Just then, a low shelf wedges itself in to your back, jarring you from
<b>Floyd</b> | your reverie. That's when you hear it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A click. A flash. The tell-tale tapping of heels on concrete.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sting of the Wasp
<b>Floyd</b> | Interactive Damage-Control
<b>Floyd</b> | by Jason Devlin.
<b>Floyd</b> | (First time players should type ABOUT)
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 1 / Serial number 040622 / Inform v6.30 Library 6/11
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The next few minutes are a blur.  Keith juts his tongue down your
<b>Floyd</b> | throat, but, without you reciprocating, it feels like he's searching
<b>Floyd</b> | for cavities. The rhythms of your body no longer coincide with his. In
<b>Floyd</b> | fact, the only rhythm left in your body is the pounding of your heart,
<b>Floyd</b> | the warm throbbing of blood in your ears. He must notice your
<b>Floyd</b> | discomfort as soon he backs off and starts buttoning his shirt.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, I gotta get back to the Pro Shop, babe,"  he says, grabbing his
<b>Floyd</b> | shades. "Stop by later." With that, he takes off down the hall, leaving
<b>Floyd</b> | you, still stunned, slumped against the wall.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Utility closet
<b>Floyd</b> | This is the first time you've been in this closet, and hopefully it
<b>Floyd</b> | will be the last. Keith assured you that no one ever comes down here.
<b>Floyd</b> | And now you can see why.  The concrete walls are oppressively close,
<b>Floyd</b> | made more so by the smell of bleach and chemicals coming from a filthy
<b>Floyd</b> | shelf against the far wall. Various brooms clutter the room, displaying
<b>Floyd</b> | none of the pleasant tidiness characteristic of the rest of Pine
<b>Floyd</b> | Meadows. All this can be escaped through a door to the south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Tossed to the side in the throes of passion, your bag, a fabulous Louis
<b>Floyd</b> | Vuitton original, lays on the ground.

<b>Floyd</b> | day. Now hardly anyone comes in here, and you can hardly blame them. It
<b>Floyd</b> | feels more like some hellish jungle than a spa. The smell is subtle but
<b>Floyd</b> | gnaws at you nonetheless. A bed of rocks, heated to drive up sweat and
<b>Floyd</b> | drive out impurities, gives the room a heavy, fevered feeling, making
<b>Floyd</b> | you wonder why they even bothered considering there is already a
<b>Floyd</b> | whirlpool to the south. For those club members who have given up on
<b>Floyd</b> | trying to hide the fact that they dye their hair, a hairdresser's
<b>Floyd</b> | station sits to one side, from which you have a clear view of the lobby
<b>Floyd</b> | and its desk to the north. And all this set to some "Sounds of Nature"
<b>Floyd</b> | CD.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Strands of gray hair form a trail through the spa, left after you gave
<b>Floyd</b> | Ms. Williams the Sinéad O'Conner look.

<b>Floyd</b> | Pine Meadows's most recent addition, the spa was built during the

<b>Floyd</b> | plastic surgery was out. Frankly, you never could understand why it was
<b>Floyd</b> | so popular. The smell of damp seaweed and aromatherapy float in from
<b>Floyd</b> | the south, where the actual spa lies. To the north and west, with a
<b>Floyd</b> | functionalism that seems out of place next to the distinctively modern
<b>Floyd</b> | architecture of the spa, are the women's and men's change facilities,
<b>Floyd</b> | respectively.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The crowning achievement of some hack designer, a desk, dominates the

<b>Floyd</b> | banquet. You've proved quite resourceful so far. Who knows? Had you
<b>Floyd</b> | known it were me from the start, you might have just been able to stop

<b>Floyd</b> | easy to bend when vulnerable, don't you agree?"

<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh well," she says, turning off the machine and wiping the sweat from
<b>Floyd</b> | her brow. As she does, Beverly glances at her watch. "My, my. Look at
<b>Floyd</b> | the time. I must be getting ready for the banquet. Oh yeah, I forgot to
<b>Floyd</b> | tell you. I talked to Charles and told him about how it had been so
<b>Floyd</b> | long since I had seen Frank and he was more than willing to seat us all

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "See you there," she says, throwing her purse over her shoulder and

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Beverly was right, the banquet is almost starting, which means Frank
<b>Floyd</b> | will be arriving soon. You run as fast as you can without breaking a
<b>Floyd</b> | sweat to the bathroom, toss your stuff in your locker, and go about
<b>Floyd</b> | making yourself look as presentable as possible. Quickly, you get the
<b>Floyd</b> | extra clothes from your locker, put them on, and go about fixing your

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Luckily, your speed pays off and you get to the banquet just in time.
<b>Floyd</b> | Frank is just arriving and Beverly is nowhere to be seen, apparently

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Banquet hall (at your table)
<b>Floyd</b> | Well, here you are, seated at a table in what amounts to the most
<b>Floyd</b> | horrifically uncomfortable chair you have ever been upon. An
<b>Floyd</b> | ostentatious centerpiece, surrounded by candles with a program leaning
<b>Floyd</b> | against it, sits in the middle of the table, its baby's breath bouncing
<b>Floyd</b> | perilously close to the flames. All around you, the din of diners
<b>Floyd</b> | talking, plates clunking, and air-conditioners whirring, fade in to the
<b>Floyd</b> | background, allowing you to concentrate on the problem at hand.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Frank sits to one side, gazing fondly at you.
