						The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each
						week at a pre-arranged time, a group of
						people meet online to cooperatively play
						a game of interactive fiction.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Moments Out of Time</em> written by L. Ross Raszewski.
						It took second place in the 2001 Interactive Fiction Competition.

					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of

<b>Floyd</b> | The indicator light switches from blue to green. The thought occurs to

<b>Floyd</b> | the change in hue that indicates clearance for a StreamDive.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your elation is such that it takes you a few seconds to respond to the
<b>Floyd</b> | indicator -- a critical error, though not a fatal one. You touch the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game uses version 6 of the Z-Machine. Because support for this
<b>Floyd</b> | format is limited, you may experience some problems in playing this
<b>Floyd</b> | game. The author believes that this game works best using the MS-DOS
<b>Floyd</b> | and Linux versions of the "Frotz" interpreter by Stefan Jokisch. Users
<b>Floyd</b> | of MS-DOS may find that the '-d1' option gives the optimal display. Of
<b>Floyd</b> | course, the game should function on any compliant Z6 interpreter.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Some versions of the WinFrotz interpreter contain a bug which makes the
<b>Floyd</b> | menu display incorrectly. If you experience difficulties, the command
<b>Floyd</b> | 'WINFROTZ' will enable a workaround to improve the display quality.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If the menu at the bottom of your screen still does not draw correctly,
<b>Floyd</b> | it can be disabled via the "MENU OFF" command.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game supports Blorb sound effects. Sound effects are included in a
<b>Floyd</b> | separate file, which may not be included with this distribution. To
<b>Floyd</b> | hear sound on a supporting interpreter, you will need to obtain a copy
<b>Floyd</b> | of the Blorb resource file for this game and make it available to your
<b>Floyd</b> | interpreter.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Please encourage interpreter authors to provide better support for
<b>Floyd</b> | version 6 games and Blorb.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Interactive fiction" is a story in which you play the main character.
<b>Floyd</b> | It is your own thinking and actions that determines the progress of the
<b>Floyd</b> | story.
<b>Floyd</b> | Works of interactive fiction, such as MOMENTS OUT OF TIME present a
<b>Floyd</b> | series of objects: rooms, items and tools, with which you can interact.
<b>Floyd</b> | In any location, it is usually a good idea to become familiar with your
<b>Floyd</b> | surroundings by exploring nearby rooms and take careful notice of the
<b>Floyd</b> | room descriptions.
<b>Floyd</b> | MOMENTS OUT OF TIME differs from many works of Interactive Fiction in
<b>Floyd</b> | its style; you will not find your progress brought to an impasse by a
<b>Floyd</b> | puzzle, nor will you be able to interact with other characters. Though
<b>Floyd</b> | you can influence your surroundings through your interaction with
<b>Floyd</b> | objects, your primary objective in this game is to explore your
<b>Floyd</b> | environment, and gather knowledge. There is a story behind MOMENTS OUT
<b>Floyd</b> | OF TIME, but your goal is to discover this story, rather than create
<b>Floyd</b> | it.
<b>Floyd</b> | Because the nature of this game is extremely open-ended, you may
<b>Floyd</b> | experience difficulty in assessing your progress. For this reason,
<b>Floyd</b> | MOMENTS OUT OF TIME keeps a numerical score. This score reflects an
<b>Floyd</b> | estimation made by the player character on your performance. This score
<b>Floyd</b> | does not, however, necessarily determine the results of the final
<b>Floyd</b> | evaluation of your performance. A perfect score is not necessary to
<b>Floyd</b> | complete the game, and indeed may not be possible, but by noting
<b>Floyd</b> | actions which increase your score, you may be able to direct your
<b>Floyd</b> | efforts.

<b>Floyd</b> | If you are not familiar with Interactive fiction, please read this
<b>Floyd</b> | section
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In Interactive Fiction, you type commands in plain English at each
<b>Floyd</b> | prompt (&gt;). Most sentences that the game understands are imperatives.
<b>Floyd</b> | To move around, you can give long commands such WALK or GO NORTH, or
<b>Floyd</b> | simply type the direction. Directions can also be abbreviated:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | NORTH               N
<b>Floyd</b> | SOUTH               S
<b>Floyd</b> | EAST                E

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There are many kinds of sentences that Inform understands. Here are
<b>Floyd</b> | some examples:
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle input">&gt;WALK NORTH</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle input">&gt;WEST</span>

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle input">&gt;READ ABOUT GRUES</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle input">&gt;PUT THE RUSTY KEY IN THE CARDBOARD BOX</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | You can use multiple objects with some verbs if you separate them with
<b>Floyd</b> | the word "AND" or a comma. You can put several inputs on a line if you
<b>Floyd</b> | separate them by the word "THEN" or a period:
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;TAKE THE BOOK, THE SPOON AND THE FROG. DROP THE FOOD THEN READ THE
<b>Floyd</b> | BOOK.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can specify all the objects in room with you by typing "ALL":
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle input">&gt;TAKE ALL</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle input">&gt;TAKE ALL THE TOOLS</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle input">&gt;DROP ALL EXCEPT THE JEWEL</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can also use the pronouns "HIM", "HER", and "IT" to refer to the
<b>Floyd</b> | last object you referred to.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | P = previous page    N = next page
<b>Floyd</b> | Q = resume story    G = Go to page
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | These are some of the most common commands for this game.
<b>Floyd</b> | LOOK (L)- One of the most useful verbs in the game. Alone, "LOOK"
<b>Floyd</b> | prints a description of your current location. You can also look at,
<b>Floyd</b> | in, under, or behind an object.
<b>Floyd</b> | EXAMINE (X)- looks at an object.
<b>Floyd</b> | SEARCH - Perform a visual search of an object from your current vantage
<b>Floyd</b> | point. If all angles of an object are not easily visible, you may need
<b>Floyd</b> | to look UNDER or BEHIND it.
<b>Floyd</b> | TAKE (GET)- You can attempt to "TAKE" any object in the game. If the
<b>Floyd</b> | object can be moved, it will be added to your inventory.
<b>Floyd</b> | INVENTORY (I)- This will list everything you are carrying or wearing.
<b>Floyd</b> | You may specify whether you want the inventory to be given in a "tall"
<b>Floyd</b> | format (one object listed underneath another), or a "wide" format
<b>Floyd</b> | (objects listed side by side). This game defaults to "TALL".
<b>Floyd</b> | WAIT (Z)- Because Inform waits for a command to advance the story, you
<b>Floyd</b> | could leave your computer, go out, take a bath, catch a game on the TV,
<b>Floyd</b> | eat a meal, play a quick game of DOOM, and return to find that no time
<b>Floyd</b> | has passed in the story. You can use "WAIT" to make time pass in the
<b>Floyd</b> | story without doing anything.

<b>Floyd</b> | you wish to wait for a specified number of turns to pass, or "WAIT
<b>Floyd</b> | UNTIL" a specified time. If anything interesting happens while you are
<b>Floyd</b> | waiting, you will be given a chance to cut short your period of
<b>Floyd</b> | passivity.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There are certain "special" commands Inform understands. These commands
<b>Floyd</b> | are addressed to the computer rather than the game.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | SAVE - This stores your current position in the game. You can later
<b>Floyd</b> | return to this position through the RESTORE command.
<b>Floyd</b> | RESTORE - Restores a previously saved game.
<b>Floyd</b> | BRIEF - This command instructs the game to print a full description of
<b>Floyd</b> | a room only the first time you enter it. On subsequent visits, only the
<b>Floyd</b> | room name and objects in it will be listed.
<b>Floyd</b> | SUPERBRIEF - This command tells the game not to print room descriptions
<b>Floyd</b> | even if you haven't been there before. It is intended primarily for
<b>Floyd</b> | those already familiar with the game.
<b>Floyd</b> | VERBOSE - In VERBOSE mode, the full room description is printed each
<b>Floyd</b> | time you enter it. This game begins in VERBOSE mode.
<b>Floyd</b> | QUIT (Q)- This lets you stop playing. If you want to save your
<b>Floyd</b> | position, you must first use the SAVE command.
<b>Floyd</b> | RESTART - This stops the game and starts it over from the beginning.
<b>Floyd</b> | VERIFY - This command verifies that the game file has not been
<b>Floyd</b> | corrupted.

<b>Floyd</b> | Q = resume story    G = Go to page
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | SCRIPT - Depending on your interpreter, a transcript of the story can
<b>Floyd</b> | be sent to either a printer or a file. "SCRIPT ON", or just "SCRIPT"
<b>Floyd</b> | begins the transcript, while "SCRIPT OFF" or "UNSCRIPT" ends the
<b>Floyd</b> | transcript.
<b>Floyd</b> | PRONOUNS - This command displays the current assignment of the pronouns
<b>Floyd</b> | "him", "her", and "it".
<b>Floyd</b> | VERSION - Shows the serial number and release number of the story.
<b>Floyd</b> | PRETTY - Depending on your computer and interpreter, some of the
<b>Floyd</b> | semi-graphical features of this game may not look right. The internal
<b>Floyd</b> | "PRETTY" settings may be changed by issuing the commands "PRETTY ON"
<b>Floyd</b> | and "PRETTY OFF". On its own, PRETTY will toggle the current pretty
<b>Floyd</b> | state.
<b>Floyd</b> | NOTIFY - Normally, you are not informed of changes in your progress
<b>Floyd</b> | rating. The command NOTIFY ON tells the game to print messages whenever
<b>Floyd</b> | this occurs. NOTIFY OFF causes these messages not to be printed. On its
<b>Floyd</b> | own, NOTIFY will toggle the current status.
<b>Floyd</b> | AGAIN (G) - This will exactly repeat the last command entered.

<b>Floyd</b> | SOUND - Some versions of this game include sound effects. If your

<b>Floyd</b> | re-enable it. "SOUND UP" and "SOUND DOWN" can be used to alter the

<b>Floyd</b> | at the prompt
<b>Floyd</b> | MENU ADD WORD x: You may also add a "word" to the custom menu. When

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The top-level menu has the following options:
<b>Floyd</b> | GAME: Game meta-commands
<b>Floyd</b> | VERBS: Common verbs

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One of the key pieces of equipment carried by your character in this
<b>Floyd</b> | game is the "StreamDive Console". The StreamDive console serves a wide
<b>Floyd</b> | variety of functions, and it will be impossible to satisfactorily
<b>Floyd</b> | complete the game without it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The StreamDive console's many functions are accessed by using
<b>Floyd</b> | StreamDive chips. In terms of the game, these functions are realized as
<b>Floyd</b> | a set of verbs provided by each chip. When a chip is in place, its
<b>Floyd</b> | commands are available as normal game verbs, but when the chip is not
<b>Floyd</b> | in place, the parser will treat the verbs as unknown.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A large number of StreamDive chips will be available to you, but the
<b>Floyd</b> | StreamDive console is only capable of holding five chips, so you will
<b>Floyd</b> | have to carefully choose those chips which provide the functionality
<b>Floyd</b> | you want. Each chip will open up certain avenues of exploration, but
<b>Floyd</b> | the restriction on the number of chips means that other areas will
<b>Floyd</b> | remain closed.

<b>Floyd</b> | Mission Summary: The purpose of your StreamDive is historical research.
<b>Floyd</b> | We have isolated an evacuated area to minimize potential corruption.
<b>Floyd</b> | You are to record all findings, but avoid direct contact with any
<b>Floyd</b> | inhabitants. Records from this zone are fragmentary, so any documents

<b>Floyd</b> | Historical Period: ca 865600-866300 UDC
<b>Floyd</b> | Possibly the darkest period in recent history, this period contains the
<b>Floyd</b> | last and largest of the intercontinental wars. Several Middle Eastern
<b>Floyd</b> | nations formed a military alliance, and began imposing expansionist
<b>Floyd</b> | policies on neighboring countries. When the United States threatened to
<b>Floyd</b> | cut off trade relations with these countries, the formed a lucrative
<b>Floyd</b> | trade alliance with China. Because during this period, industrialized
<b>Floyd</b> | nations were still highly dependent on fossil fuel, an alliance of
<b>Floyd</b> | western nations declared war on China and the Arabic alliance. Tactical
<b>Floyd</b> | nuclear warheads were used by both sides, resulting in the near-total
<b>Floyd</b> | annihilation of many US-sympathetic countries in southeast Asia. Though
<b>Floyd</b> | US nuclear weapons were unable to breach Chinese countermeasures,
<b>Floyd</b> | several Chinese nuclear missiles did penetrate the US defensive system,
<b>Floyd</b> | obliterating a number of cities. The war was finally ended when the
<b>Floyd</b> | massive space station Kennedy crashed to Earth near the Chinese
<b>Floyd</b> | capital. The resulting explosion killed over two billion people,
<b>Floyd</b> | forcing the Chinese government to capitulate. However, widespread
<b>Floyd</b> | environmental and war damage left the entire world badly crippled.
<b>Floyd</b> | Reconstruction would take much of the next century, and the extensive
<b>Floyd</b> | costs of rebuilding the damaged world forced the beginning of
<b>Floyd</b> | governmental alliances that would eventually lead to a United Earth
<b>Floyd</b> | Government.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your mission occurs during the opening of the nuclear phase of the war.
<b>Floyd</b> | At 785278.83 UDC, a missile launched from China will exploit the breach
<b>Floyd</b> | in the US missile shield. Nine hours later, its course will be diverted
<b>Floyd</b> | away from Washington, DC to avoid US countermeasures. It will narrowly
<b>Floyd</b> | miss a secondary target, several miles from your Dive site, at 865741.8
<b>Floyd</b> | UDC.

<b>Floyd</b> | Space Station Kennedy
<b>Floyd</b> | The first orbital platform intended for permanent occupation, Space
<b>Floyd</b> | Station Kennedy was assembled in Earth orbit in the second quarter of
<b>Floyd</b> | the twenty-first century. Compared with earlier projects, Kennedy was
<b>Floyd</b> | ambitious; it contained living facilities for twenty-five families,
<b>Floyd</b> | and, unlike earlier space stations, its primary function was not
<b>Floyd</b> | scientific, but industrial. Methods of zero-gravity production which
<b>Floyd</b> | had previously been tested on earlier space missions were implemented
<b>Floyd</b> | on a grand scale. It was also the first space vehicle to be equipped
<b>Floyd</b> | with a synthetic gravity system. After two decades of service, the
<b>Floyd</b> | station was badly damaged during the intercontinental war of the mid
<b>Floyd</b> | twenty-first century. Its crew were not able to prevent a forced
<b>Floyd</b> | re-entry, and chose to direct the crashing space station to a heavily
<b>Floyd</b> | inhabited area of China. Everyone aboard the station was killed in the
<b>Floyd</b> | resulting explosion, which also resulted in severe environmental
<b>Floyd</b> | catastrophes in Asia, prompting the end of the war.

<b>Floyd</b> | Mr. Wallace,
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In response to your inquiry, Arcotech shelters are designed to
<b>Floyd</b> | withstand most conventional attacks and fallout resulting from nuclear
<b>Floyd</b> | attacks. However, no consumer shelter can provide total protection. In
<b>Floyd</b> | the unlikely event that a nuclear strike occurs sufficiently close that
<b>Floyd</b> | your shelter would be within the cratered area, our level of protection
<b>Floyd</b> | would fail. Please keep in mind, however, that the chances of a nuclear
<b>Floyd</b> | strike close to your home are miniscule.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We hope that your concerns have been addressed in a timely and useful
<b>Floyd</b> | manner. Please contact us if you have further concerns.

<b>Floyd</b> | Q = resume story    G = Go to page
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Dear customer,
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The following technical support information is being sent in response
<b>Floyd</b> | to your message entitled: "Eye recharge fails", dated 5/11. If you
<b>Floyd</b> | believe this message has been sent in error, please contact
<b>Floyd</b> | abuse@optitron-biotechnics.usa
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Dear Mr. Wallace,
<b>Floyd</b> | Though recharge failures are rare, they do occur. Please be sure to
<b>Floyd</b> | clean the optic unit and charger receptacle thoroughly, as directed by
<b>Floyd</b> | your user manual. We find that over 90% of recharging difficulties are
<b>Floyd</b> | due to dirty contacts or charger misuse. If the problem persists, it
<b>Floyd</b> | may point to battery exhaustion. Though Optitron LZ-model storage units
<b>Floyd</b> | generally last at least 10 years, excessive wear and environmental
<b>Floyd</b> | conditions can shorten their lifetimes. Since your unit is over six
<b>Floyd</b> | years old, there is a small service charge for replacing the power
<b>Floyd</b> | unit. This charge covers installation of a new power cell, unit
<b>Floyd</b> | cleaning, and re-alignment.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Please consider upgrading your prosthesis to the new LZ100-model, which
<b>Floyd</b> | adds the following enhancements:
<b>Floyd</b> |  *Compatible with M-VIDEO 7 image capture devices
<b>Floyd</b> |  *Improved resolution and focus
<b>Floyd</b> |  *New long-life power cell, capable of storing power for 72 hours of
<b>Floyd</b> | use
<b>Floyd</b> |  *High-speed recharge: battery can be charged to capacity in under 2
<b>Floyd</b> | hours
<b>Floyd</b> |  *Power-saving mode: engages when eyes are closed to conserve power
<b>Floyd</b> |  *In-place recharger: the prosthesis can be charged without removal
<b>Floyd</b> |  *Increased comfort and durability
<b>Floyd</b> |  *New life-like cosmetic lens: prosthesis is undetectable under casual
<b>Floyd</b> | examination
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We hope this information has been useful in solving your problem.
<b>Floyd</b> | Please cite this incident number (31821) your response if you wish to
<b>Floyd</b> | update your support issue.

<b>Floyd</b> | Camphor Tryst

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Can you believe this shit?
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;In these times of trial, every American Citizen must do his part
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;to ensure a safe and prosperous future for your country. If the
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;enemies of freedom are to be defeated, we must be able to meet
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;their vile atrocities with whatever force necessary.
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;Many traitors and cowards have tried to claim that this war is
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;unnecessary, and have avoided their patriotic duty by claiming
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;cowardly "conscientious objector" status.
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;If the US is to arise victorious from this war, such cowards and
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;traitors must be stopped. Every man in this country has a patriotic
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;duty to serve in the armed forces during this conflict. DON'T WAIT
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;to be drafted. ENLIST TODAY
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;For the army we fight is a dangerous foe, with armies to spare.
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;Back at home, the brave women of the united states have a duty to
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;their country as well. Arms and equipment manufacturers all over
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;the country are hiring laborers to ensure that our boys abroad have
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;what they need to win this conflict.
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;But the women of this country have yet a more important duty to our
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;future. As wives and mothers they must help raise our youth to
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;understand the importance of the war we fight, and to help rebuild
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;our population in hope of the day when freedom again reigns
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;supreme.
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;The militant lesbian conspiracy has attempted GENOCIDE by fooling
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;the female population into shirking their duty to produce a new
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;generation of Americans to carry on the fight. It is the duty of
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;EVERY woman, regardless of age, income, or sexual "preference" to
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;contribute their genetic material to future generations by bearing
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;as many children as they are physically capable. Birth rates in the
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;US have been steadily declining for almost a century, and our enemies
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;KNOW IT! They want to watch us die out!
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;Selfish traitors claim that we are trying to "oppress" womankind by
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;"enslaving" them to their biology. These traitors ignore the fact that
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;they play the most important role in our future. Before shipping out
<b>Floyd</b> | to
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;defend our great nation, every man should make arrangements to ensure
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;that his DNA is preserved in future generations by impregnating his
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;spouse or lover, and by making regular contributions to sperm banks.
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;The future of our country is in your hands. Put aside your selfishness
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;and do what's right!

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Mr. Wallace, Thank you for your concern. According to our records, your
<b>Floyd</b> | ArcoTech shelter is designed to provide living facilities for four
<b>Floyd</b> | persons for thirty years. Because we realize that unforeseen
<b>Floyd</b> | circumstances might increase the number of persons occupying the
<b>Floyd</b> | shelter (births, inability to turn away unprepared neighbors), all our
<b>Floyd</b> | shelters provide some leeway. In the situation described, the addition
<b>Floyd</b> | of another person might decrease shelter comfort and efficiency, but
<b>Floyd</b> | should not seriously endanger you or your family. If it becomes
<b>Floyd</b> | necessary to occupy your shelter, you should implement stricter
<b>Floyd</b> | rationing than normal to ensure that supplies are not over-taxed.
<b>Floyd</b> | Because air and water availability are your most pressing concerns, we
<b>Floyd</b> | recommend you install the Arcotech Supplementary Life Support System,
<b>Floyd</b> | which will reduce the load on the main system to increase shelter
<b>Floyd</b> | comfort if it is made to provide for more occupants.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We hope that your concerns have been addressed in a timely and useful
<b>Floyd</b> | manner. Please contact us if you have further concerns.

<b>Floyd</b> | Term used to describe the period from September to November of the
<b>Floyd</b> | old-calendar year 2102. Reconstruction after the wars of the previous
<b>Floyd</b> | century left most of the world in the debt of seventeen
<b>Floyd</b> | megacorporations. On September 12, 2102 (old date), the
<b>Floyd</b> | megacorporations foreclosed on the collective nations of the world, and
<b>Floyd</b> | assumed legal control of the planet. They were met with little
<b>Floyd</b> | resistance from world populations, who had grown dissatisfied with the
<b>Floyd</b> | national governments. Though their leadership was able to provide rapid
<b>Floyd</b> | improvement of living conditions for many inhabitants, the task of
<b>Floyd</b> | managing an entire planet proved too much for the megacorporations, who
<b>Floyd</b> | soon discovered that the world as a whole could not be run profitably.
<b>Floyd</b> | After several administrative fiascoes, the most notable of which
<b>Floyd</b> | involved the firing and eviction from Earth of the entire population of
<b>Floyd</b> | Canada, the corporate consortium itself declared bankruptcy exactly 70
<b>Floyd</b> | days after its inception, thrusting the world into anarchy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The United Earth Directorate quickly arose to fill the infrastructure

<b>Floyd</b> | April 25 - Jim keeps going on about this new program he's working on.
<b>Floyd</b> | Thinks it's going to, and I quote, "set him up among the gods." He's
<b>Floyd</b> | trying to get in touch with a bunch of professors at the big-league CS
<b>Floyd</b> | schools. Thinks he's hot stuff. Dad, who really ought to know better,
<b>Floyd</b> | asked him about his new "discovery", and he went on for about an hour,
<b>Floyd</b> | not really saying anything that made much sense. The long and short of
<b>Floyd</b> | it is that he thinks he's figured out how his brain works, and he
<b>Floyd</b> | thinks he's got a way to make a computer do the same thing. Wonderful.
<b>Floyd</b> | A computer that thinks like my brother.

<b>Floyd</b> | May 6 - You are not fucking going to believe this. They've started up
<b>Floyd</b> | the draft. And what's more? They're not taking girls. I know, they've
<b>Floyd</b> | never taken them before, but they said that they would now, since
<b>Floyd</b> | they're all "liberated" and shit.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Anyway, why aren't they taking girls, you ask? Well, there was a
<b>Floyd</b> | fucking commercial. A fucking commercial explaining how important women
<b>Floyd</b> | were to the war effort, and that's why they're not drafting them. And
<b>Floyd</b> | the way they're important to the war effort? You're gonna fucking love
<b>Floyd</b> | this -- reproduction. They're saying that it's "The duty of all
<b>Floyd</b> | citizens to make full use of their reproductive capabilities to ensure
<b>Floyd</b> | that our population remains strong and growing through these times of
<b>Floyd</b> | adversity."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What is this, the fucking dark ages? In addition to their
<b>Floyd</b> | heart-fucking-felt sermon, they've voted in a massive tax-break for
<b>Floyd</b> | families with newborns, a government handout for women who get
<b>Floyd</b> | themselves pregnant, and subsidies for unmarried women who want
<b>Floyd</b> | artificial insemination. They're also rushing through a bunch of
<b>Floyd</b> | fertility drugs that increase the chances of having twins. The got some
<b>Floyd</b> | low-level flunkie in one of the fringe groups on record saying that it
<b>Floyd</b> | was the "sworn duty of every woman to attempt conception", and that
<b>Floyd</b> | parents should encourage their daughters to get themselves knocked up
<b>Floyd</b> | as young as fifteen. They're trying to fucking breed themselves an
<b>Floyd</b> | army.

<b>Floyd</b> | May 17 (later) - Fell asleep without taking my eye out so it's dead
<b>Floyd</b> | today. And no one ever told me how much it hurts if you sleep with
<b>Floyd</b> | contacts in. Told mom I was too sick to see the shrink today, which
<b>Floyd</b> | isn't far from the truth. I managed to get Donna down to her bed before
<b>Floyd</b> | mom went to wake her up for breakfast. As if we could eat. We crashed
<b>Floyd</b> | in my room most of the day so no one would see how sick we were.

<b>Floyd</b> | June 2 - Donna is still acting funny. I wonder if she's worried about

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | June 3 - As close as I can tell, I'm a free woman again. Mom and Dad
<b>Floyd</b> | aren't watching me constantly, and I can pretty much come and go as I
<b>Floyd</b> | please, with the caveat that I can't stay out too long, what with the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But I'm worried about Donna. She wanders off for hours at a time,
<b>Floyd</b> | doesn't say anything.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | June 4 - Jimmy's got himself a girlfriend. How cute. She's a
<b>Floyd</b> | rolly-polly little thing with coke-bottle glasses who thinks the sun

<b>Floyd</b> | but there was something distant about her. About the only thing she was

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | June 10 - Rained all day today. After watching a whole lot of TV, we

<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room
<b>Floyd</b> | The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
<b>Floyd</b> | does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
<b>Floyd</b> | room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
<b>Floyd</b> | "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
<b>Floyd</b> | video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
<b>Floyd</b> | living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
<b>Floyd</b> | an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
<b>Floyd</b> | the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
<b>Floyd</b> | a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
<b>Floyd</b> | are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
<b>Floyd</b> | the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
<b>Floyd</b> | the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
<b>Floyd</b> | closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
<b>Floyd</b> | foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Construction
<b>Floyd</b> | Arcotech shelters are built with the highest degree of precision
<b>Floyd</b> | technology to provide optimal support and security. Shelter roofs and
<b>Floyd</b> | walls are built from high-tech steel corrugated arch panels to ensure
<b>Floyd</b> | maximum strength and load-bearing. The corrugated design allows
<b>Floyd</b> | high-quality seals between arch panels so that shelters can be built of
<b>Floyd</b> | any length.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Arcotech shelters come standard with heavy steel endwalls. For added
<b>Floyd</b> | protection, concrete endwall reinforcements are available. Due to the
<b>Floyd</b> | patented interlocking all-steel design, additional layers of protection
<b>Floyd</b> | can be added to the arch or endwalls.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For the ultimate in radiation protection, lead insulating sheets may be
<b>Floyd</b> | added.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | All Arcotech shelters come with a reinforced heavy steel door. Thick
<b>Floyd</b> | security bolts ensure that the shelter cannot be breached. Many
<b>Floyd</b> | Arcotech shelters include a secondary egress hatch, which can be
<b>Floyd</b> | installed in the roof with a minimal reduction in structural integrity.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Life-support Equipment
<b>Floyd</b> | Arcotech shelters include the latest in high-endurance life support
<b>Floyd</b> | equipment. All Arcotech shelters are equipped with both secure
<b>Floyd</b> | ventilation systems for processing outside air, and with an advanced
<b>Floyd</b> | air recycling system. In emergencies, the shelter can be sealed and
<b>Floyd</b> | operate entirely on stored air reserves for up to six months at a time.
<b>Floyd</b> | When outside air is safe for use, it can be used to replenish internal
<b>Floyd</b> | supplies in a matter of hours.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The water recycling system standard on Arcotech shelters is able to
<b>Floyd</b> | provide adequate, safe water supplies over extended periods. With
<b>Floyd</b> | strict water rationing, the shelter is able to recycle approximately
<b>Floyd</b> | 85% of its stored water. Optional accessories include facilities for
<b>Floyd</b> | collecting and purifying water from surface runoff and underground
<b>Floyd</b> | deposits. The standard water storage system included with each Arcotech
<b>Floyd</b> | shelter contains sufficient reserves for three months of use. With
<b>Floyd</b> | water recycling and collection, usable water may be replenished
<b>Floyd</b> | indefinitely.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sanitation and waste-disposal facilities in Arcotech Shelters are
<b>Floyd</b> | second to none. The low-energy waste incinerator reduces all human and
<b>Floyd</b> | other waste products to compact ash, which is stored in the insecure
<b>Floyd</b> | waste pit. Waste pit capacities vary with space availability, but are
<b>Floyd</b> | generally large enough to store several years worth of waste.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The standard equipment for Arcotech home survival shelters includes a
<b>Floyd</b> | 30-year supply of nonperishable food stocks designed to meet all
<b>Floyd</b> | nutritional needs. Users with infants and small children are advised to
<b>Floyd</b> | consider ordering the optional child nutrition supplement.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In addition for stocks of first-aid supplies, the medical stores
<b>Floyd</b> | standard in Arcotech shelters include medical equipment and medicine
<b>Floyd</b> | for treating minor maladies and injuries, along with detailed, useful
<b>Floyd</b> | information on their use. To foster adequate health and morale, most
<b>Floyd</b> | shelters are capable of increasing the normally dim lights to output
<b>Floyd</b> | sun-like spectra for limited periods. By using this feature several
<b>Floyd</b> | times a week, occupants can avoid depression and diseases caused by
<b>Floyd</b> | lack of sunlight.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Arcotech shelters are powered by a patented high-performance chemical
<b>Floyd</b> | induction system, which can deliver operating power to the shelter for
<b>Floyd</b> | at least 30 years without replenishment. For above-ground shelters,
<b>Floyd</b> | solar power cells are also available. The energy source is suitably
<b>Floyd</b> | shielded from EMP effects which may accompany nuclear attacks.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Accommodations
<b>Floyd</b> | Arcotech home survival shelters come standard with accommodations for
<b>Floyd</b> | families of four, six, eight, and twelve persons. Accommodations for
<b>Floyd</b> | larger groups may be custom ordered.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Standard accommodations include comfortable, high-durability bedding
<b>Floyd</b> | with optional privacy screens, a dining and utility table with chairs,
<b>Floyd</b> | personal storage compartments, and durable survival clothing. Efficient
<b>Floyd</b> | kitchen, laundry, and toilet facilities are also provided, as is a
<b>Floyd</b> | privacy-screen area for low-water washing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Because of the importance of maintaining morale during an extended
<b>Floyd</b> | stay, Arcotech shelters also contain minimal facilities for relaxation,
<b>Floyd</b> | exercise, and entertainment. All non-value-line models of Arcotech
<b>Floyd</b> | shelters include a "relaxation area", consisting of a foldable couch
<b>Floyd</b> | (which may be raised to form an exercise area), small television with
<b>Floyd</b> | video and music player, and storage space large enough to contain a
<b>Floyd</b> | small library or children's toys.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Security/Survival
<b>Floyd</b> | All Arcotech shelters are equipped with the following minimal equipment
<b>Floyd</b> | to facilitate survival in times of crisis. Many other options are
<b>Floyd</b> | available. Contact your Arcotech Sales Representative for a full list
<b>Floyd</b> | of features recommended in your area.
<b>Floyd</b> |  *Easy-to-use radiation meters
<b>Floyd</b> |  *Two 30" 22 mag. cal. single-action rifles and ammunition for personal
<b>Floyd</b> | defense and hunting
<b>Floyd</b> |  *Shortwave radio and transmitter
<b>Floyd</b> |  *Desktop computer with wireless network connection
<b>Floyd</b> |  *"Panic" locking mechanism: Shelter egress can be secured so that its
<b>Floyd</b> | entryway cannot be opened from inside for a specified time, or until
<b>Floyd</b> | radiation levels are safe, to prevent early egress in the event an
<b>Floyd</b> | occupant becomes unreasonable
<b>Floyd</b> |  *Cyanide capsules: stored in a locked box, also fitted with a panic
<b>Floyd</b> | locking mechanism, are provided as a painless alternative to radiation
<b>Floyd</b> | sickness or degenerative illness
<b>Floyd</b> |  *Government approved survival instructions: Arcotech is the only
<b>Floyd</b> | shelter manufacturer to equip each shelter with all of the Federal
<b>Floyd</b> | Government's latest survival instruction booklets. Other manufacturers
<b>Floyd</b> | often use dangerously out-of-date materials, some nearly a century old
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Arcotech: Your Life May Depend On It
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You notice that the document mentions nothing about protection from
<b>Floyd</b> | photo-nuclear weapons. Though the document is grossly limited in its
<b>Floyd</b> | treatment of technical considerations, you quickly realize that such a
<b>Floyd</b> | shelter would not provide adequate protection from even non-nuclear
<b>Floyd</b> | attacks closer than a few dozen kilometers away. Its primary utility
<b>Floyd</b> | rests in protecting its occupants from residual radiation released by
<b>Floyd</b> | fallout from a distant bomb strike. Of course, a far less opulent
<b>Floyd</b> | shelter would still provide adequate defense under such circumstances.

<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room
<b>Floyd</b> | The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
<b>Floyd</b> | does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
<b>Floyd</b> | room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
<b>Floyd</b> | "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
<b>Floyd</b> | video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
<b>Floyd</b> | living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
<b>Floyd</b> | an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
<b>Floyd</b> | the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
<b>Floyd</b> | a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
<b>Floyd</b> | are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
<b>Floyd</b> | the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
<b>Floyd</b> | the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
<b>Floyd</b> | closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
<b>Floyd</b> | foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.

<b>Floyd</b> | Kitchen
<b>Floyd</b> | In the days before all food could be prepared by an automated

<b>Floyd</b> | predominant style is kept to a minimum. Heavier items and food supplies

<b>Floyd</b> | Dining Room
<b>Floyd</b> | When this house was first built, conventions of style dictated a degree
<b>Floyd</b> | of spartan functionality from the dining area. The construction of this
<b>Floyd</b> | room has a sort of tacit apology built into its architecture, as if the
<b>Floyd</b> | dedication of an entire room to dining facilities was seen as an
<b>Floyd</b> | undesirable extravagance. The twenty years that followed saw a reversal
<b>Floyd</b> | of the cultural mores which had all but done away with a fixed dining
<b>Floyd</b> | area. The net result is that this particular dining room has an
<b>Floyd</b> | uncomfortable blend of styles. A small, nondescript table shows signs
<b>Floyd</b> | of heavier wear than it was meant for. An ornate china cabinet stands
<b>Floyd</b> | in one corner, looking very out-of-place. The buffet counter, again
<b>Floyd</b> | nondescript and too small to be really serviceable, stretches across a
<b>Floyd</b> | portion of the north wall. Open archways lead south and east, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | small door is west.

<b>Floyd</b> | Dining Room
<b>Floyd</b> | When this house was first built, conventions of style dictated a degree
<b>Floyd</b> | of spartan functionality from the dining area. The construction of this
<b>Floyd</b> | room has a sort of tacit apology built into its architecture, as if the
<b>Floyd</b> | dedication of an entire room to dining facilities was seen as an
<b>Floyd</b> | undesirable extravagance. The twenty years that followed saw a reversal
<b>Floyd</b> | of the cultural mores which had all but done away with a fixed dining
<b>Floyd</b> | area. The net result is that this particular dining room has an
<b>Floyd</b> | uncomfortable blend of styles. A small, nondescript table shows signs
<b>Floyd</b> | of heavier wear than it was meant for. An ornate china cabinet stands
<b>Floyd</b> | in one corner, looking very out-of-place. The buffet counter, again
<b>Floyd</b> | nondescript and too small to be really serviceable, stretches across a
<b>Floyd</b> | portion of the north wall. Open archways lead south and east, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | small door is west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the buffet are two oil lamps.

<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room
<b>Floyd</b> | The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
<b>Floyd</b> | does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
<b>Floyd</b> | room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
<b>Floyd</b> | "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
<b>Floyd</b> | video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
<b>Floyd</b> | living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
<b>Floyd</b> | an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
<b>Floyd</b> | the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
<b>Floyd</b> | a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
<b>Floyd</b> | are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
<b>Floyd</b> | the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
<b>Floyd</b> | the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
<b>Floyd</b> | closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the

<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room
<b>Floyd</b> | The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
<b>Floyd</b> | does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
<b>Floyd</b> | room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
<b>Floyd</b> | "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
<b>Floyd</b> | video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
<b>Floyd</b> | living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
<b>Floyd</b> | an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
<b>Floyd</b> | the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
<b>Floyd</b> | a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
<b>Floyd</b> | are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
<b>Floyd</b> | the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
<b>Floyd</b> | the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
<b>Floyd</b> | closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
<b>Floyd</b> | foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.

<b>Floyd</b> | Of all the rooms you've seen so far, this bedroom shows the least signs

<b>Floyd</b> | that the room is long-overdue for renovation. There is a bookcase along
<b>Floyd</b> | one wall, containing model space ships, toy robots, and a very few
<b>Floyd</b> | books. A desk beside the door is loaded down with computer equipment.
<b>Floyd</b> | The most interesting feature of the room is the floor; while most of
<b>Floyd</b> | the other rooms have had wall-to-wall carpeting, this room has what
<b>Floyd</b> | appears to be industrial grade linoleum tile. The hallway lies west.

<b>Floyd</b> | Jim,
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hello. Dr. Shalanzar showed me some of the work you've done, and I
<b>Floyd</b> | can't believe my eyes. I'm going to forward some of my research to you,
<b>Floyd</b> | maybe we can work together. I didn't think it was possible, but it
<b>Floyd</b> | looks like you're most of the way to a viable simulation of human
<b>Floyd</b> | functioning. I could certainly use some of your heuristics in my own
<b>Floyd</b> | project. Let me tell you, having a paper out in a journal is a pretty
<b>Floyd</b> | sure-fire way to get your college career paid for.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | From what you've told me, I agree that taking a comprehensive
<b>Floyd</b> | activation scan of a human brain is feasible with your heuristic, and
<b>Floyd</b> | it may be the only way to solve the missing part of your simulation.
<b>Floyd</b> | The main problem is that you could only take the kind of readings you
<b>Floyd</b> | need if you had some kind of direct interface to the optic nerve. And,
<b>Floyd</b> | of course, you'd need a human subject willing to have an optical
<b>Floyd</b> | interface implant. I doubt you could get it past an ethics review
<b>Floyd</b> | board.

<b>Floyd</b> | D00dz,
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Found a relay this week, something that the can't trace you back from.
<b>Floyd</b> | I've got the Plover program running on about sixty systems now, and I
<b>Floyd</b> | think we can bring down all kinds of shit.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Jimbo comes through again. We got into the missile security system last
<b>Floyd</b> | night. Good thing we were using the relay or there'd be black
<b>Floyd</b> | helicopters at my house now, but if we can get the shroud working
<b>Floyd</b> | right, hell, we could even nuke a small country if we wanted.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | No new sites this week, but I've got one better. Dante swapped out
<b>Floyd</b> | Lynchzilla's LZ-100 for his, with the remote chip. He's got about 8
<b>Floyd</b> | hours of her "monitoring" the girl's locker room. You know how big a
<b>Floyd</b> | dyke she is, well we got the goods, since she since she did some
<b>Floyd</b> | hardcore "monitoring" while Libby Sikes was in the showers after field
<b>Floyd</b> | hockey practice. It's all up on Dante's LibertyNet node. He put up some
<b>Floyd</b> | pretty sick stuff too, Lynchzilla "entertaining" herself.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This is really hard, and I'm probably not making a lot of sense, but I

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's just that lately, I've been feeling kind of pressured by you. I

<b>Floyd</b> | that I don't want to have sex with you, but this is kind of fast.
<b>Floyd</b> | You're my first real bf, and I don't want to rush into it and feel bad

<b>Floyd</b> | now I keep getting this vibe from you that you're getting impatient. I
<b>Floyd</b> | keep getting afraid that if we do it, I'll be lousy and you'll leave
<b>Floyd</b> | me, or it'll change everything and it'll get all weird.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Look, I'm sorry. This is probably all in my head. You know I don't want
<b>Floyd</b> | to hurt you.

<b>Floyd</b> | Guys, we've got a problem. Like, a BIG problem.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I was watching the feed from Coach Lynch's eye today after school,
<b>Floyd</b> | right? So she's in her office after practice and Libby Sikes comes in,
<b>Floyd</b> | ok? And they're talking for a while, but I can't hear what they're
<b>Floyd</b> | saying, of course. After a while, Lynchzilla shuts the door, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | couple of minutes later, she's feeling Libby up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I ran the video by Marty, since he's deaf and reads lips. From Libby's
<b>Floyd</b> | side of it, it looks like she's gonna get cut from the team, on account
<b>Floyd</b> | of she sucks ass at field hockey. And, we're not too sure on this, but
<b>Floyd</b> | it looks like Lynch is gonna let her stay on the team if she fucks her.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lynch should go to jail for fucking a student, but no one but us knows
<b>Floyd</b> | about it, and all the proof we got is this recording, so if we give it
<b>Floyd</b> | to the cops, we'll be in the cell right next to her. We should never
<b>Floyd</b> | have done this.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So what should we do?

<b>Floyd</b> | Of all the rooms you've seen so far, this bedroom shows the least signs
<b>Floyd</b> | of having been tidied before the house was abandoned. Naturally, of
<b>Floyd</b> | course, this heightens your curiosity; untidy rooms generally tell you
<b>Floyd</b> | more than clean ones. From the space-shuttle wallpaper, you suspect
<b>Floyd</b> | that this room belonged to a young child, though it might simply imply
<b>Floyd</b> | that the room is long-overdue for renovation. There is a bookcase along
<b>Floyd</b> | one wall, containing model space ships, toy robots, and a very few
<b>Floyd</b> | books. A desk beside the door is loaded down with computer equipment.
<b>Floyd</b> | The most interesting feature of the room is the floor; while most of
<b>Floyd</b> | the other rooms have had wall-to-wall carpeting, this room has what
<b>Floyd</b> | appears to be industrial grade linoleum tile. The hallway lies west.

<b>Floyd</b> | Originally an outgrowth of a research project in distributed document

<b>Floyd</b> | The system propagated documents in a semi-anonymous manner so that

<b>Floyd</b> | FYEO
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Clearance granted for immediate StreamDive. Target is local grid
<b>Floyd</b> | reference 0x1549. Temporal Reference 785278.7 UDC. We will be in phase
<b>Floyd</b> | for StreamDive at 865741.3 UDC. Dive duration not to exceed .5 units
<b>Floyd</b> | UDC (12 hours local time). Stream Capacitance field will be set for
<b>Floyd</b> | auto-recall at this time.
<b>Floyd</b> | Research unit indicates high levels of stream distortion in this zone,
<b>Floyd</b> | indicating that premature extraction may not be possible.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Mission Summary: The purpose of your StreamDive is historical research.
<b>Floyd</b> | We have isolated an evacuated area to minimize potential corruption.
<b>Floyd</b> | You are to record all findings, but avoid direct contact with any
<b>Floyd</b> | inhabitants. Records from this zone are fragmentary, so any documents
<b>Floyd</b> | of historical interest should be added to your DataStore.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | *WARNING*
<b>Floyd</b> | Due to ambient radiation levels, wideband recall will not be available.
<b>Floyd</b> | Since StreamDive instruments are shielded against EMP effects, lost
<b>Floyd</b> | components may be recoverable after destruction of the local grid
<b>Floyd</b> | section. For this reason, level 1b restrictions are in effect for the
<b>Floyd</b> | duration of this dive.

<b>Floyd</b> | April 20 - Dreamt last night. The unbelievable pleasure of feeling a
<b>Floyd</b> | knife being thrust into my chest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Mom didn't take the bait. Maybe she's not still snooping on me.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | April 22 - They're sending troops into the middle east. Everyone says
<b>Floyd</b> | not to worry and we'll just clear this up like we have before. There's
<b>Floyd</b> | not going to be a war. But we've already got troops in so many other
<b>Floyd</b> | places. Jim's terrified that he's gonna get drafted. There hasn't been
<b>Floyd</b> | a draft in almost a hundred years though. The news says this will blow
<b>Floyd</b> | over in a couple of months, but Jimmy says that the president's an ass
<b>Floyd</b> | and he wants a war to boost his popularity rating. Dad thinks he's an
<b>Floyd</b> | idiot because no president would think that starting a war and getting
<b>Floyd</b> | hundreds of our people killed would make him popular. Maybe I should
<b>Floyd</b> | start reading the papers more.

<b>Floyd</b> | April 25 - Jim keeps going on about this new program he's working on.
<b>Floyd</b> | Thinks it's going to, and I quote, "set him up among the gods." He's
<b>Floyd</b> | trying to get in touch with a bunch of professors at the big-league CS
<b>Floyd</b> | schools. Thinks he's hot stuff. Dad, who really ought to know better,
<b>Floyd</b> | asked him about his new "discovery", and he went on for about an hour,
<b>Floyd</b> | not really saying anything that made much sense. The long and short of
<b>Floyd</b> | it is that he thinks he's figured out how his brain works, and he
<b>Floyd</b> | thinks he's got a way to make a computer do the same thing. Wonderful.

<b>Floyd</b> | May 6 - You are not fucking going to believe this. They've started up
<b>Floyd</b> | the draft. And what's more? They're not taking girls. I know, they've
<b>Floyd</b> | never taken them before, but they said that they would now, since
<b>Floyd</b> | they're all "liberated" and shit.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Anyway, why aren't they taking girls, you ask? Well, there was a
<b>Floyd</b> | fucking commercial. A fucking commercial explaining how important women
<b>Floyd</b> | were to the war effort, and that's why they're not drafting them. And
<b>Floyd</b> | the way they're important to the war effort? You're gonna fucking love
<b>Floyd</b> | this -- reproduction. They're saying that it's "The duty of all
<b>Floyd</b> | citizens to make full use of their reproductive capabilities to ensure
<b>Floyd</b> | that our population remains strong and growing through these times of
<b>Floyd</b> | adversity."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What is this, the fucking dark ages? In addition to their
<b>Floyd</b> | heart-fucking-felt sermon, they've voted in a massive tax-break for
<b>Floyd</b> | families with newborns, a government handout for women who get
<b>Floyd</b> | themselves pregnant, and subsidies for unmarried women who want
<b>Floyd</b> | artificial insemination. They're also rushing through a bunch of
<b>Floyd</b> | fertility drugs that increase the chances of having twins. The got some
<b>Floyd</b> | low-level flunkie in one of the fringe groups on record saying that it
<b>Floyd</b> | was the "sworn duty of every woman to attempt conception", and that
<b>Floyd</b> | parents should encourage their daughters to get themselves knocked up
<b>Floyd</b> | as young as fifteen. They're trying to fucking breed themselves an
<b>Floyd</b> | army.

<b>Floyd</b> | May 7 - Oh the shit has hit the fan. There's rioting in the streets.
<b>Floyd</b> | The people who don't like the war are protesting the war. The people
<b>Floyd</b> | who don't like the draft are protesting the draft. Pretty much everyone
<b>Floyd</b> | is protesting the breeding plan, except for the ones that are lined up
<b>Floyd</b> | around the block to get a big fat shot of fertility drugs and the big
<b>Floyd</b> | fat check that goes with it. Mom's friend that works for a doctor says
<b>Floyd</b> | that they've been asked not to tie anyone's tubes or give out
<b>Floyd</b> | contraceptives anymore. I found out that Jim's stockpiling condoms, on
<b>Floyd</b> | the off chance he manages to get a girl who doesn't think the rest of
<b>Floyd</b> | him's as ugly as his face. Says there's a bill in congress to restrict
<b>Floyd</b> | the sale of anything that prevents pregnancy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Donna's friend Rusty is talking about signing up. She's trying to talk
<b>Floyd</b> | him out of it, but he figures his draft notice is in the mail already

<b>Floyd</b> | June 7 - We're sending troops into Vietnam. Where have I heard that
<b>Floyd</b> | before?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | June 9 - Donna asked me to try on some of her clothes. I don't like
<b>Floyd</b> | wearing a skirt, but she said I have really nice legs & I should show
<b>Floyd</b> | them off. Nice legs? Anyway, I hope this means she's feeling better,
<b>Floyd</b> | but there was something distant about her. About the only thing she was
<b>Floyd</b> | willing to talk about was the time I slit my wrists. Morbid.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | June 10 - Rained all day today. After watching a whole lot of TV, we
<b>Floyd</b> | basically just sat around. I worked on new pages for my code book while
<b>Floyd</b> | Donna just sat there and watched me.

<b>Floyd</b> | Basement
<b>Floyd</b> | The basement of this house is a simple, large room with cinderblock
<b>Floyd</b> | walls. Boxes, crates, and other large items are scattered haphazardly
<b>Floyd</b> | about. A lightweight wooden door in the east wall appears to be an
<b>Floyd</b> | exterior exit, presumably to allow heavy gardening equipment, such as
<b>Floyd</b> | the lawnmower in one corner, to be removed. The stairs up to the rest
<b>Floyd</b> | of the house are along the south wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | And something unusual. The west wall is metal, with a very large,
<b>Floyd</b> | robust door set in it.
<b>Floyd</b> | It couldn't be. Or could it? You've never actually seen one before, but
<b>Floyd</b> | from your records...
<b>Floyd</b> | Yes. It is. It's a bomb shelter; a small room specially designed to act
<b>Floyd</b> | as an emergency shelter in the event of nuclear attack. None have

<b>Floyd</b> | Bomb Shelter
<b>Floyd</b> | This is career-making stuff. A period survival shelter, fully intact
<b>Floyd</b> | and operational. The ceiling and walls form a single-piece dome, which,
<b>Floyd</b> | you recall, increased the structural stability with the building
<b>Floyd</b> | materials they had available. The eastern end, nearest the exit, seems
<b>Floyd</b> | to be some kind of living area, with a table and several chairs. Past
<b>Floyd</b> | it, you can see four bunked beds. At the far end of the shelter is a
<b>Floyd</b> | curtained area, holding the minimal sanitation facilities.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, your training releases its hold over your mind and lets you
<b>Floyd</b> | take notice of what would have been the first thing anyone but a
<b>Floyd</b> | StreamDiver would see. Two female bodies, quite motionless, lie on one
<b>Floyd</b> | of the beds. You don't need to check for a pulse on either of them
<b>Floyd</b> | [Footnote 4], but you do, all the same.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Still warm. Your hands tremble, and it takes a moment to force yourself
<b>Floyd</b> | to calm down. You've seen dead bodies before, on missions. Victims of
<b>Floyd</b> | the massacre on Mars Colony Omega, ritual sacrifice victims in an Aztec
<b>Floyd</b> | temple, but the immediacy of these deaths is something you weren't
<b>Floyd</b> | prepared for. They can't have been dead for more than a few hours, may
<b>Floyd</b> | even have died while you were in the house. You try to tell yourself
<b>Floyd</b> | that this is an irrelevant detail -- from your proper perspective,
<b>Floyd</b> | they, and everyone else on the planet, have been dead for hundreds of

<b>Floyd</b> | Historical Period: ca 865600-866300 UDC
<b>Floyd</b> | Possibly the darkest period in recent history, this period contains the
<b>Floyd</b> | last and largest of the intercontinental wars. Several Middle Eastern
<b>Floyd</b> | nations formed a military alliance, and began imposing expansionist
<b>Floyd</b> | policies on neighboring countries. When the United States threatened to
<b>Floyd</b> | cut off trade relations with these countries, the formed a lucrative
<b>Floyd</b> | trade alliance with China. Because during this period, industrialized
<b>Floyd</b> | nations were still highly dependent on fossil fuel, an alliance of
<b>Floyd</b> | western nations declared war on China and the Arabic alliance. Tactical
<b>Floyd</b> | nuclear warheads were used by both sides, resulting in the near-total
<b>Floyd</b> | annihilation of many US-sympathetic countries in southeast Asia. Though
<b>Floyd</b> | US nuclear weapons were unable to breach Chinese countermeasures,
<b>Floyd</b> | several Chinese nuclear missiles did penetrate the US defensive system,
<b>Floyd</b> | obliterating a number of cities. The war was finally ended when the
<b>Floyd</b> | massive space station Kennedy crashed to Earth near the Chinese
<b>Floyd</b> | capital. The resulting explosion killed over two billion people,
<b>Floyd</b> | forcing the Chinese government to capitulate. However, widespread
<b>Floyd</b> | environmental and war damage left the entire world badly crippled.
<b>Floyd</b> | Reconstruction would take much of the next century, and the extensive
<b>Floyd</b> | costs of rebuilding the damaged world forced the beginning of
<b>Floyd</b> | governmental alliances that would eventually lead to a United Earth
<b>Floyd</b> | Government.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your mission occurs during the opening of the nuclear phase of the war.
<b>Floyd</b> | At 785278.83 UDC, a missile launched from China will exploit the breach
<b>Floyd</b> | in the US missile shield. Nine hours later, its course will be diverted
<b>Floyd</b> | away from Washington, DC to avoid US countermeasures. It will narrowly
<b>Floyd</b> | miss a secondary target, several miles from your Dive site, at 865741.8
<b>Floyd</b> | UDC.

<b>Floyd</b> | 4:45 pm
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We were supposed to do it together. That was the plan.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We thought it through, talked about it over and over.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nothing else made any sense. The safety broke down. The door isn't
<b>Floyd</b> | going to open for thirty years. We can't just stay down here for thirty
<b>Floyd</b> | years. And what about her? We can't take care of that on our own.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Still, we might have tried. We might have been able to work something
<b>Floyd</b> | out. But we haven't heard anything upstairs for days. Not that you can
<b>Floyd</b> | hear much, but sometimes there's a little banging in the pipes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | That damned radio. My hand's all cut up from smashing it to bits.
<b>Floyd</b> | There's going to be an air strike. They don't know where yet, but there
<b>Floyd</b> | isn't any way to stop it. We're less than a hundred miles from the
<b>Floyd</b> | biggest military base in three states. Even if we survive, no one's
<b>Floyd</b> | going to find us. No one's going to save us.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So we decided. I unlocked the box. I took out two pills...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This is all my fault. If I hadn't been so damned paranoid, we wouldn't
<b>Floyd</b> | even be down here. It's my fault that Donna's dead. It's my fault that
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm going to be dead.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We were going to do it together. We laid down on the bed, next to each
<b>Floyd</b> | other, and she hugged me, and she told me she didn't blame me, and then
<b>Floyd</b> | we were going to bite down at the same time and it would all be over.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm such a fucking coward.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I don't think she felt anything. I hope she didn't know what a coward I
<b>Floyd</b> | am. She closed her eyes, and I closed mine, and then she just sort of
<b>Floyd</b> | shook once, and it was over. And I got up, and I laid her out flat and
<b>Floyd</b> | crossed her arms over her chest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What the fuck is wrong with me? I don't want to live. I never cared if
<b>Floyd</b> | I lived or died since the accident six years ago, and I sure as hell
<b>Floyd</b> | don't want to live down here for the next thirty years, especially now
<b>Floyd</b> | that Donna's gone. I tried to kill myself once before. All I have to do
<b>Floyd</b> | is bite down.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So why won't my hands stop shaking? I'm going to do it now. For real
<b>Floyd</b> | this time.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm not getting back into the same bed with Donna. I don't deserve
<b>Floyd</b> | that.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I hope my parents will forgive me. I hope Jim will forgive me. Most of
<b>Floyd</b> | all, though, I hope Donna will forgive me.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Goodbye.

<b>Floyd</b> | Current Events
<b>Floyd</b> | April 25
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This morning, at 7:42 AM, Congress ratified a declaration of war
<b>Floyd</b> | against an alliance of countries in the Middle East. The official
<b>Floyd</b> | reasons for this declaration were the unlawful occupation of Israel by
<b>Floyd</b> | allied Arabic forces. Nonetheless, several articles in the Global
<b>Floyd</b> | Register suppose that recent military action was motivated by trade
<b>Floyd</b> | restrictions imposed by the Arabic Alliance against Europe and the
<b>Floyd</b> | United States. These restrictions have severely limited the
<b>Floyd</b> | availability of gasoline in the US. According to the April 20 issue of
<b>Floyd</b> | the National Chronicle, the Arabic states have formed an exclusive
<b>Floyd</b> | trade pact with China. The Brandenberg News Network has run several
<b>Floyd</b> | stories saying that Chinese weapons were used in the invasion of
<b>Floyd</b> | Israel, and editorials in several newspapers claim that if the war
<b>Floyd</b> | escalates, China will enter the war on the side of the Arabic Alliance.
<b>Floyd</b> | An article in the Times says that the Chinese newspapers have already
<b>Floyd</b> | printed articles calling for war unless the US backs out of affairs in
<b>Floyd</b> | the Middle East.

<b>Floyd</b> | 4:45 pm
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We were supposed to do it together. That was the plan.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We thought it through, talked about it over and over.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nothing else made any sense. The safety broke down. The door isn't
<b>Floyd</b> | going to open for thirty years. We can't just stay down here for thirty
<b>Floyd</b> | years. And what about her? We can't take care of that on our own.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Still, we might have tried. We might have been able to work something
<b>Floyd</b> | out. But we haven't heard anything upstairs for days. Not that you can
<b>Floyd</b> | hear much, but sometimes there's a little banging in the pipes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | That damned radio. My hand's all cut up from smashing it to bits.
<b>Floyd</b> | There's going to be an air strike. They don't know where yet, but there
<b>Floyd</b> | isn't any way to stop it. We're less than a hundred miles from the
<b>Floyd</b> | biggest military base in three states. Even if we survive, no one's
<b>Floyd</b> | going to find us. No one's going to save us.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So we decided. I unlocked the box. I took out two pills...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This is all my fault. If I hadn't been so damned paranoid, we wouldn't
<b>Floyd</b> | even be down here. It's my fault that Donna's dead. It's my fault that
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm going to be dead.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We were going to do it together. We laid down on the bed, next to each
<b>Floyd</b> | other, and she hugged me, and she told me she didn't blame me, and then
<b>Floyd</b> | we were going to bite down at the same time and it would all be over.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm such a fucking coward.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I don't think she felt anything. I hope she didn't know what a coward I
<b>Floyd</b> | am. She closed her eyes, and I closed mine, and then she just sort of
<b>Floyd</b> | shook once, and it was over. And I got up, and I laid her out flat and
<b>Floyd</b> | crossed her arms over her chest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What the fuck is wrong with me? I don't want to live. I never cared if
<b>Floyd</b> | I lived or died since the accident six years ago, and I sure as hell
<b>Floyd</b> | don't want to live down here for the next thirty years, especially now
<b>Floyd</b> | that Donna's gone. I tried to kill myself once before. All I have to do
<b>Floyd</b> | is bite down.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So why won't my hands stop shaking? I'm going to do it now. For real
<b>Floyd</b> | this time.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm not getting back into the same bed with Donna. I don't deserve
<b>Floyd</b> | that.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I hope my parents will forgive me. I hope Jim will forgive me. Most of
<b>Floyd</b> | all, though, I hope Donna will forgive me.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Goodbye.

<b>Floyd</b> | April 25
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This morning, at 7:42 AM, Congress ratified a declaration of war
<b>Floyd</b> | against an alliance of countries in the Middle East. The official
<b>Floyd</b> | reasons for this declaration were the unlawful occupation of Israel by
<b>Floyd</b> | allied Arabic forces. Nonetheless, several articles in the Global
<b>Floyd</b> | Register suppose that recent military action was motivated by trade
<b>Floyd</b> | restrictions imposed by the Arabic Alliance against Europe and the
<b>Floyd</b> | United States. These restrictions have severely limited the
<b>Floyd</b> | availability of gasoline in the US. According to the April 20 issue of
<b>Floyd</b> | the National Chronicle, the Arabic states have formed an exclusive
<b>Floyd</b> | trade pact with China. The Brandenberg News Network has run several
<b>Floyd</b> | stories saying that Chinese weapons were used in the invasion of
<b>Floyd</b> | Israel, and editorials in several newspapers claim that if the war
<b>Floyd</b> | escalates, China will enter the war on the side of the Arabic Alliance.
<b>Floyd</b> | An article in the Times says that the Chinese newspapers have already
<b>Floyd</b> | printed articles calling for war unless the US backs out of affairs in
<b>Floyd</b> | the Middle East.

<b>Floyd</b> | The basement of this house is a simple, large room with cinderblock
<b>Floyd</b> | walls. Boxes, crates, and other large items are scattered haphazardly
<b>Floyd</b> | about. A lightweight wooden door in the east wall appears to be an
<b>Floyd</b> | exterior exit, presumably to allow heavy gardening equipment, such as
<b>Floyd</b> | the lawnmower in one corner, to be removed. The stairs up to the rest
<b>Floyd</b> | of the house are along the south wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | And something unusual. The west wall is metal, with a very large,
<b>Floyd</b> | robust door set in it.
<b>Floyd</b> | The house shakes hard as a something, probably an aircraft or small
<b>Floyd</b> | bomb, crashes to earth in the distance.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The stack of boxes teeters unsteadily. Another shake like that could

<b>Floyd</b> | Girl's Bedroom
<b>Floyd</b> | Coming, as you do, from an enlightened time period where man has, by
<b>Floyd</b> | and large, learned to overcome prejudicial assumptions about people on
<b>Floyd</b> | the basis of gender or background [Footnote 6], you know better than to
<b>Floyd</b> | jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
<b>Floyd</b> | stereotypes of their living space.
<b>Floyd</b> | Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
<b>Floyd</b> | particular thing [Footnote 7]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
<b>Floyd</b> | from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
<b>Floyd</b> | dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
<b>Floyd</b> | corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
<b>Floyd</b> | ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
<b>Floyd</b> | insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
<b>Floyd</b> | certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
<b>Floyd</b> | quarters.
<b>Floyd</b> | The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,
<b>Floyd</b> | well stocked, but uncluttered. There is a closet door on the east wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | The exit to the hall is south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the nightstand is a charger.
<b>Floyd</b> | Somewhere, probably a few kilometers away, there is an explosion. The
<b>Floyd</b> | house rocks, and you have a hard time keeping your footing.

<b>Floyd</b> | The viewpoint of the camera suggests that the wearer is seated in front
<b>Floyd</b> | of a portable computer. Her hand reaches out and picks up a small
<b>Floyd</b> | device beside the computer. She turns it over, presumably examining it
<b>Floyd</b> | from all angles. The hand turns the device until its barrel-end points
<b>Floyd</b> | directly into the camera. A finger twitches, pressing a button. A flash
<b>Floyd</b> | of light issues from the end of the device, and the image flickers,
<b>Floyd</b> | distorts, and breaks up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When the image returns, the device has been dropped to the table. The
<b>Floyd</b> | wearer stands, and the camera reels in unsteady ascent. Again a hand
<b>Floyd</b> | reaches out, this time to switch the computer off. It takes a small red
<b>Floyd</b> | pill from the table, and then moves to the wearer's mouth.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The camera turns quickly, and moves toward one of the bunked beds. It
<b>Floyd</b> | focuses on the motionless body of a beautiful blonde girl. The image
<b>Floyd</b> | switches to infrared, showing the characteristic cooling of a recently
<b>Floyd</b> | deceased body, then the camera changes back to the visual spectrum. The
<b>Floyd</b> | camera bobs up and down, as if slowly nodding. It moves toward the face
<b>Floyd</b> | of the dead girl, and stays very close to one cheek for a long time.
<b>Floyd</b> | The camera withdraws, and the wearer extends a hand, tracing the
<b>Floyd</b> | shoulder and arm of the corpse, finally coming to rest atop the folded
<b>Floyd</b> | hands. The wearer's hand squeezes the dead hands once, then the camera
<b>Floyd</b> | turns toward the opposite cot.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The camera moves toward the cot, then turns and lowers, finally
<b>Floyd</b> | pitching back as the wearer lies down. A hand moves toward the camera,
<b>Floyd</b> | and as it passes in front of it, the recording ends.

<b>Floyd</b> | April 17 - Mom found my diary and read it. I'm ashamed at how I acted.
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm very angry at her for invading my privacy, but I understand that
<b>Floyd</b> | she's just worried about me.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She doesn't want me to see CJ anymore because he's a bad influence. I
<b>Floyd</b> | guess I see her point, but I really care about him.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I have to start seeing a therapist again. Maybe he will help me feel
<b>Floyd</b> | better about myself.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | April 18 - Jimmy pulled a prank on me. It was mean. I didn't tell mom,
<b>Floyd</b> | but I hope she finds out and punishes him.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | April 19 - Met with the doctor today. It was really good to talk with
<b>Floyd</b> | someone.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | April 21 - We had lima beans with dinner tonight. I hate lima beans.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | April 22 - It looks like there's going to be a war. I'm really scared.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | April 24 - I saw my old friend Donna today. I hope I get to talk to
<b>Floyd</b> | her. She's nice. It would be good to have a friend again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | April 25 - Jimmy has some new idea for a computer program. I wish I was
<b>Floyd</b> | that smart. Maybe he'll get rich and famous.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | April 26 - I saw the doctor again. I think I'm making progress.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | April 27 - I had a nightmare about the accident last night. I remember
<b>Floyd</b> | Donna's mom screaming when the guy ran that red light. The car got hit
<b>Floyd</b> | on Donna's side, so she's so lucky just to be alive. I wouldn't have
<b>Floyd</b> | been hurt at all if I'd had my seat belt on. I got thrown over top of
<b>Floyd</b> | Donna when the car spun around and landed face down on what was left of
<b>Floyd</b> | her window. I remember Donna screaming for her mom, because she was out
<b>Floyd</b> | cold, but I don't remember doing anything myself. Just laying there
<b>Floyd</b> | with a big piece of glass through my eye.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | April 29 - The fighting keeps getting worse in china and the middle
<b>Floyd</b> | east.
<b>Floyd</b> | April 30 - I got to talk to Donna. She's doing well, but she lives with
<b>Floyd</b> | her dad now. I invited her over to dinner tomorrow. Hope mom doesn't
<b>Floyd</b> | mind. I wanted to talk to her longer but mom worries if I don't get
<b>Floyd</b> | home right away after school.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 1 - Mom made her "famous" squash stuffing with pork chops. I like
<b>Floyd</b> | it better with steak. Jimmy made himself look bad by asking her about
<b>Floyd</b> | the scar she has from the accident. After dinner we talked and did
<b>Floyd</b> | homework. She's a much better friend than CJ.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 2 - I have to decide what to do about college. Mom doesn't want me
<b>Floyd</b> | to go away. Since my grades weren't good enough to get into a good
<b>Floyd</b> | school, I guess it doesn't make much difference. I'm not smart like
<b>Floyd</b> | Jimmy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 3 - I told the doctor that I was afraid because of the war, and how
<b>Floyd</b> | bad I feel about my eye. He showed me some exercises to not get so hung
<b>Floyd</b> | up on it. Seems kind of silly, but I'll give it a shot.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 4 - Donna and I went SHOPPING! I love shopping. I really lost out
<b>Floyd</b> | not having any girl friends for so long. Donna talked me into buying
<b>Floyd</b> | this little pink top and a floral mini that she said makes me look
<b>Floyd</b> | cute. I guess it's good for me to start dressing like a girl again
<b>Floyd</b> | instead of all the black frumpy things I always wear. It was kind of a
<b>Floyd</b> | low cut shirt though. Donna said she wished she could get away with
<b>Floyd</b> | wearing something like that, which is kind of a nice way of saying that
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm flat.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 5 - I really wish I had Frankie the Bear back. I miss him.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 6 - * They're drafting. I'm scared that Jimmy will get picked. They
<b>Floyd</b> | made a lot of other announcements about wanting women to start having
<b>Floyd</b> | more babies. That sounds really stupid. I bet there's going to be a lot
<b>Floyd</b> | of fighting about that.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 7 - And there was. Mom took me aside today and asked me what I
<b>Floyd</b> | would think if she and Daddy tried to have another baby. I don't think
<b>Floyd</b> | she should, since things might get bad with the war. She doesn't like
<b>Floyd</b> | the way that everyone's trying to railroad women into having more
<b>Floyd</b> | babies, but she says that if too many people get killed, it won't be
<b>Floyd</b> | good for the future.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 8 - Donna met a new guy named Tom. I think he's nice. It's good for
<b>Floyd</b> | her to be dating someone
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 9 - Dad cooked something new with lots of sprouts. Sprouts are
<b>Floyd</b> | supposed to be healthy, but doesn't it cancel them out if you fry them?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 10 - I saw the doctor. I don't think we got to anything new. There
<b>Floyd</b> | was something funny about him, like he kept wanting to tell me
<b>Floyd</b> | something but never got up the nerve.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 11 - My eye didn't work today. Daddy got all upset and shouted
<b>Floyd</b> | about crummy workmanship. Mom thought I should go out to the mall with
<b>Floyd</b> | Donna anyway, but I don't like people seeing me with my eyepatch so we
<b>Floyd</b> | just stayed in.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 12 - It worked today. Daddy told me to clean the charger and be
<b>Floyd</b> | more careful.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 13 - Donna's dad is going off to serve in the navy. Mom says she
<b>Floyd</b> | can stay with us until the end of school, since she can't stay with her
<b>Floyd</b> | mom. I'm glad.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 14 - There's a party friday for the boys who are going to war. Mom
<b>Floyd</b> | says I can't go. It's not fair.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 15 - Happy Birthday! Mom changed her mind about the party, since
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm 18 now and she says I can be trusted to make my own decisions. I
<b>Floyd</b> | got some nice stuff. Donna's boyfriend got drafted, and she's really
<b>Floyd</b> | upset.

<b>Floyd</b> | May 17 - The party wasn't much fun so we left early. Good thing since

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 18 - The war keeps getting worse. I wish they'd just find a
<b>Floyd</b> | peaceful answer.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 19 - Donna wanted some fun so we tried on each other's clothes.
<b>Floyd</b> | We're about the same size, but her boobs are bigger, so some of the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 20 - The war keeps getting worse. Some kids at school are saying

<b>Floyd</b> | electronic shield that stops bombs from getting through.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 21 - I had a nightmare about the bombs dropping.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 22 - School seems so empty. Lots of guys in my class got drafted.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 24 - The doctor said some stuff I didn't like. I told mom about it
<b>Floyd</b> | and she told me I didn't have to go anymore.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 27 - The air raid drills in school are kind of weird. I don't think

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 28 - * Almost a week early. I'm usually a metronome.

<b>Floyd</b> | Girl's Bedroom
<b>Floyd</b> | Coming, as you do, from an enlightened time period where man has, by
<b>Floyd</b> | and large, learned to overcome prejudicial assumptions about people on
<b>Floyd</b> | the basis of gender or background [Footnote 6], you know better than to
<b>Floyd</b> | jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
<b>Floyd</b> | stereotypes of their living space.
<b>Floyd</b> | Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
<b>Floyd</b> | particular thing [Footnote 7]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
<b>Floyd</b> | from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
<b>Floyd</b> | dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
<b>Floyd</b> | corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
<b>Floyd</b> | ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | This is a magazine whose articles showcase current events in the
<b>Floyd</b> | scientific community. It is written to a target audience of educated,
<b>Floyd</b> | but not scientifically trained, readers.
<b>Floyd</b> | You browse through the magazine, looking for anything of interest. You
<b>Floyd</b> | are not disappointed. There is a short article, all the way at the
<b>Floyd</b> | back, summarizing the doctoral thesis of one Emmanuel Kaldeki.
<b>Floyd</b> | This is quite a find; Kaldeki's original thesis has long been lost, and
<b>Floyd</b> | it has long been assumed that he had not pursued the line of research
<b>Floyd</b> | that would eventually lead to StreamDive technology until after the
<b>Floyd</b> | war. You read the article...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Physicist Emmanuel Kaldeki created a buzz in the scientific world early
<b>Floyd</b> | this month with the delivery of his PhD thesis, "Mathematical Modeling
<b>Floyd</b> | of Non-Temporal Quantum Particles" at the Pacific Institute of
<b>Floyd</b> | Technology. The paper describes a set of mathematical formulae which
<b>Floyd</b> | model a theoretical particle called "Q-omega". The Q-omega particle,
<b>Floyd</b> | according to Kaldeki's model, behaves in most respects like a
<b>Floyd</b> | strange-matter quark, but also exhibits properties previously only
<b>Floyd</b> | modeled in tachyons. Specifically, it reacts in unusual ways to
<b>Floyd</b> | space-time curvature. The Kaldeki model suggests that that at
<b>Floyd</b> | relativistic velocities, the Q-omega particle would "plane" on highly
<b>Floyd</b> | curved space-time, in much the same way that the hull of a speed boat
<b>Floyd</b> | planes over water.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Most of the excitement over Kaldeki's paper comes not from the modeling
<b>Floyd</b> | technique itself, but from the two major example models included. The
<b>Floyd</b> | first demonstrates how the non-temporal nature of the Q-omega particle
<b>Floyd</b> | renders it immune from the effects of time and mass dilation occurring
<b>Floyd</b> | at speeds near that of light. Indeed, because of their unique nature,
<b>Floyd</b> | the model shows that Q-omega particles can be accelerated above the
<b>Floyd</b> | speed of light, a possibility generally disallowed by the theory of
<b>Floyd</b> | relativity.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The second, and more impressive example studies the behavior of Q-omega
<b>Floyd</b> | in the vicinity of a black hole. Under such extreme space-time
<b>Floyd</b> | curvature, Kaldeki predicts that the Q-omega particle would completely
<b>Floyd</b> | disassociate itself with conventional space-time, being displaced along
<b>Floyd</b> | a predictable path to some distant point in the universe
<b>Floyd</b> | instantaneously. Because the path of the particle does not go through
<b>Floyd</b> | space-time during this journey, it is possible for Q-omega to re-enter
<b>Floyd</b> | normal space at a point in time prior to its departure.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The scientific community is excited about the implications of this
<b>Floyd</b> | theory: several researchers have suggested that Kaldeki's findings may
<b>Floyd</b> | open the way to faster-than-light travel, matter transmission, and time
<b>Floyd</b> | travel. Asked about these possibilities, Kaldeki said, "I think it's a
<b>Floyd</b> | bit early to start talking about applications; we don't even know yet
<b>Floyd</b> | if the particles I've modeled can be created. There's nothing in the
<b>Floyd</b> | mathematics that would prohibit [these applications], but actually
<b>Floyd</b> | doing it is a long way off. You've got to remember, we're talking about
<b>Floyd</b> | sub-atomic particles, and if we could scale the effect to something the
<b>Floyd</b> | size of, say, a man, it's not very likely that a living creature could
<b>Floyd</b> | survive being moved around like that."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Kaldeki has received a grant for an undisclosed amount to pursue the
<b>Floyd</b> | fabrication of these particles. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy in
<b>Floyd</b> | Quantum Physics will be conferred upon Emmanuel Kaldeki by the Pacific
<b>Floyd</b> | Institute of Technology during commencement exercises next month.

<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room
<b>Floyd</b> | The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
<b>Floyd</b> | does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
<b>Floyd</b> | room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
<b>Floyd</b> | "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
<b>Floyd</b> | video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
<b>Floyd</b> | living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
<b>Floyd</b> | an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
<b>Floyd</b> | the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
<b>Floyd</b> | a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
<b>Floyd</b> | are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
<b>Floyd</b> | the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
<b>Floyd</b> | the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
<b>Floyd</b> | closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
<b>Floyd</b> | foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.

<b>Floyd</b> | auto-recall at this time.
<b>Floyd</b> | Research unit indicates high levels of stream distortion in this zone,
<b>Floyd</b> | indicating that premature extraction may not be possible.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Mission Summary: The purpose of your StreamDive is historical research.
<b>Floyd</b> | We have isolated an evacuated area to minimize potential corruption.
<b>Floyd</b> | You are to record all findings, but avoid direct contact with any
<b>Floyd</b> | inhabitants. Records from this zone are fragmentary, so any documents
<b>Floyd</b> | of historical interest should be added to your DataStore.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | *WARNING*
<b>Floyd</b> | Due to ambient radiation levels, wideband recall will not be available.
<b>Floyd</b> | Since StreamDive instruments are shielded against EMP effects, lost
<b>Floyd</b> | components may be recoverable after destruction of the local grid
<b>Floyd</b> | section. For this reason, level 1b restrictions are in effect for the
<b>Floyd</b> | duration of this dive.

<b>Floyd</b> | is compared to your records to ensure that you are indeed the person
<b>Floyd</b> | scheduled for this dive. From your training, you know that this record
<b>Floyd</b> | will be compared again when you emerge, to ensure that nothing
<b>Floyd</b> | important about your physiology has altered during the dive. The only
<b>Floyd</b> | visible sign of it is a faint play of laser-light over your body.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Satisfied, an unseen operator opens the door into the next chamber,
<b>Floyd</b> | where a flash of laser-light, radiation, and sickly-sweet aerosol
<b>Floyd</b> | renders you free of micro-organisms.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You are allowed to move on only after placing your hand in an

<b>Floyd</b> | is a room that knows the seriousness of its function. It is far larger
<b>Floyd</b> | than anything it would ever hold, but its size is a necessity of the
<b>Floyd</b> | design. The constant, low hum of the massive generators that power the
<b>Floyd</b> | time machine is inaudible only here. The room feels like another world
<b>Floyd</b> | itself, neither part of the present nor the past.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's all in the hands of the folks upstairs now...

<b>Floyd</b> | In the days before all food could be prepared by an automated

<b>Floyd</b> | kitchenwares give the room a rustic look. The stove, refrigerator and
<b>Floyd</b> | other appliances have a more modern look, but clashing with the
<b>Floyd</b> | predominant style is kept to a minimum. Heavier items and food supplies
<b>Floyd</b> | are kept in the pantry to the west, while archways lead north and east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the refrigerator door are a report card and a receipt.

<b>Floyd</b> | The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
<b>Floyd</b> | does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every

<b>Floyd</b> | "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
<b>Floyd</b> | video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
<b>Floyd</b> | living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
<b>Floyd</b> | an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
<b>Floyd</b> | the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
<b>Floyd</b> | a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
<b>Floyd</b> | are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
<b>Floyd</b> | the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
<b>Floyd</b> | the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
<b>Floyd</b> | closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the

<b>Floyd</b> | Den
<b>Floyd</b> | As an architectural feature, the den declined in popularity during this

<b>Floyd</b> | your historical research, you know that a den is a sort of cross
<b>Floyd</b> | between a study and a family room. This room shows signs of wear;
<b>Floyd</b> | stains and worn patches of carpet suggest heavy use. Behind one
<b>Floyd</b> | recliner, the woodgrain paneling of the wall is scratched and scored
<b>Floyd</b> | from frequent collisions. One wall is covered in bookshelves. A
<b>Floyd</b> | well-stocked wet bar adorns a second. Couches and armchairs form a
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation area in the middle of the room. The western wall is open,
<b>Floyd</b> | leading back to the stairway.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the bar are four glasses (empty) and some bottles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A video game system sits before the video screen.

<b>Floyd</b> | The video screen flickers with computer-generated violence. Before it,

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She blushes. "Distracted?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He places three fingers against her cheek, gently turning her face

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She bursts out laughing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He looks away, feigning shame. "Well, that's done a lot for my self

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She puts both hands on his face and tries to pull him back into a kiss.
<b>Floyd</b> | She doesn't make it, bursting out with more laughter just before their
<b>Floyd</b> | lips touch. This time, he laughs too.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Would it help if I told you I had no idea what I'm doing?" he says.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She laughs some more. "Neither do I. I don't know why I can't stop
<b>Floyd</b> | laughing. I've never done this before."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "That's a relief," Jim says. He tries to kiss her again, and this time

<b>Floyd</b> | "This isn't working," Amy says, trying not to laugh. "We are such
<b>Floyd</b> | geeks."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You have no idea what kind of pressure this is putting on me."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Amy smiles slyly. "Maybe this will help." She puts a leg over his,
<b>Floyd</b> | moving onto his lap.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well that's taken the pressure off," he says with more than a hint of
<b>Floyd</b> | sarcasm. "What now, count to three?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She giggles. "One," he says.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Two," they say in unison.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Amy takes him by surprise, not waiting any longer, and pushes her lips
<b>Floyd</b> | against his. Jim falls backward in surprise, but, though they are both
<b>Floyd</b> | failing to totally suppress laughter, they manage to maintain contact.
<b>Floyd</b> | Jim places a hand against Amy's neck, then moves it down to the small
<b>Floyd</b> | of her back. A few seconds later, he moves his hand down even further.

<b>Floyd</b> | Kitchen
<b>Floyd</b> | In the days before all food could be prepared by an automated

<b>Floyd</b> | are kept in the pantry to the west, while archways lead north and east.

<b>Floyd</b> | Dining Room
<b>Floyd</b> | When this house was first built, conventions of style dictated a degree
<b>Floyd</b> | of spartan functionality from the dining area. The construction of this
<b>Floyd</b> | room has a sort of tacit apology built into its architecture, as if the
<b>Floyd</b> | dedication of an entire room to dining facilities was seen as an
<b>Floyd</b> | undesirable extravagance. The twenty years that followed saw a reversal
<b>Floyd</b> | of the cultural mores which had all but done away with a fixed dining
<b>Floyd</b> | area. The net result is that this particular dining room has an
<b>Floyd</b> | uncomfortable blend of styles. A small, nondescript table shows signs
<b>Floyd</b> | of heavier wear than it was meant for. An ornate china cabinet stands
<b>Floyd</b> | in one corner, looking very out-of-place. The buffet counter, again
<b>Floyd</b> | nondescript and too small to be really serviceable, stretches across a
<b>Floyd</b> | portion of the north wall. Open archways lead south and east, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | small door is west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the buffet are two oil lamps.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Four people, two adults, and two teen-age children sit around the
<b>Floyd</b> | table. The adult woman, the mother, has her hands clasped on the table,
<b>Floyd</b> | as if about to say a prayer, but she thinks better of it as the boy
<b>Floyd</b> | begins to load his plate down with some casserole dish.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "So, how was everyone's day?" the father asks, distractedly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The girl rolls her eyes and looks away. The boy, between rapid, greedy
<b>Floyd</b> | mouthfulls, says, "Did the two of you know that I'm a genius? Like
<b>Floyd</b> | Einstein, only I can do long division."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This time, it is the mother who rolls her eyes. "So how come you're
<b>Floyd</b> | only getting a ninety-nine in calculus?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Katia," the father says, evenly. "What is it this time, Jimmy?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The boy smiles, self-satisfied. "Oh, just a little discovery that's
<b>Floyd</b> | going to set me up among the gods."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Can I be excused? I think I'm getting sick," the girl says.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Julie, please," he father mildly reprimands. "So what's this
<b>Floyd</b> | discovery?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Jimmy has clearly been waiting for a chance to brag. "Dad," he says,
<b>Floyd</b> | with a conspiratorial tone indicating that he considers the subject
<b>Floyd</b> | above the level of the women. "You remember what I was saying about
<b>Floyd</b> | backwards-mapping activation patterns onto a neural network?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The father nods, though without any conviction. Jimmy doesn't appear to
<b>Floyd</b> | care. "I got in touch with a professor at Pacific Tech, he's the top
<b>Floyd</b> | guy in distributed neural nets. Well, he says that I'm on the right
<b>Floyd</b> | track, and my preliminaries open up something they've never even looked
<b>Floyd</b> | at before.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "See, I figure you can represent a human mind by imposing a
<b>Floyd</b> | non-deterministic neural network over this thing called a DeKrupper
<b>Floyd</b> | mapping function."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Which means?" the father asks, cautiously.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The boy sighs, taking the explanation to be beneath his dignity. "It
<b>Floyd</b> | means you can emulate all the functions of a human brain on a computer.
<b>Floyd</b> | Everyone's always thought that was impossible, because it's supposed to
<b>Floyd</b> | reduce to the halting problem. But it doesn't really, because all the
<b>Floyd</b> | proofs for it are based on something that doesn't apply when you use a
<b>Floyd</b> | Nth-level polymatrix."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "So..." the father takes some time to put it all together. "You could
<b>Floyd</b> | create a sentient computer program?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Jimmy beams with pride. "Bingo. But more than that; I mean, you don't
<b>Floyd</b> | have to emulate the whole brain, you could just build up a part of it,
<b>Floyd</b> | like, you could make a computer that does all the work for your motor
<b>Floyd</b> | functions."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "To help people with brain injuries," the father concludes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Jimmy nods. "Of course, the sentient program thing is what's goign to
<b>Floyd</b> | get me the nobel prize."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Wait a minute," the mother says. "You can't do that. You can't know
<b>Floyd</b> | exactly how a human brain works."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "But you can," Jimmy protests. "You just need to back-map from the
<b>Floyd</b> | activation patterns."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "And if this is so simple, why hasn't anyone done it? It won't work."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Mom," Jimmy says, exasperated. "You said the same thing when I came up
<b>Floyd</b> | with the idea for the automatic navigation thing for the car. We could
<b>Floyd</b> | all be rich now if you hadn't told me it wouldn't work."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I never said that," she says, defensively. "I said that I didn't think
<b>Floyd</b> | you could make it work in a way that would be useful outside of very
<b>Floyd</b> | specific examples."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Jimmy sighs. "Look, it's all perfectly simple."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You're perfectly simple," his sister interrupts. "And you're giving me
<b>Floyd</b> | a headache. I'll be in my room."

<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room
<b>Floyd</b> | The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
<b>Floyd</b> | does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
<b>Floyd</b> | room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
<b>Floyd</b> | "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
<b>Floyd</b> | video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
<b>Floyd</b> | living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
<b>Floyd</b> | an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
<b>Floyd</b> | the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
<b>Floyd</b> | a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
<b>Floyd</b> | are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
<b>Floyd</b> | the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
<b>Floyd</b> | the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
<b>Floyd</b> | closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
<b>Floyd</b> | foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.

<b>Floyd</b> | Girl's Bedroom
<b>Floyd</b> | Coming, as you do, from an enlightened time period where man has, by

<b>Floyd</b> | the basis of gender or background [Footnote 4], you know better than to
<b>Floyd</b> | jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
<b>Floyd</b> | stereotypes of their living space.
<b>Floyd</b> | Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
<b>Floyd</b> | particular thing [Footnote 5]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
<b>Floyd</b> | from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
<b>Floyd</b> | dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
<b>Floyd</b> | corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
<b>Floyd</b> | ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
<b>Floyd</b> | insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
<b>Floyd</b> | certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
<b>Floyd</b> | quarters.
<b>Floyd</b> | The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,
<b>Floyd</b> | well stocked, but uncluttered. There is a closet door on the east wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | The exit to the hall is south.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Dining Room
<b>Floyd</b> | When this house was first built, conventions of style dictated a degree
<b>Floyd</b> | of spartan functionality from the dining area. The construction of this
<b>Floyd</b> | room has a sort of tacit apology built into its architecture, as if the
<b>Floyd</b> | dedication of an entire room to dining facilities was seen as an
<b>Floyd</b> | undesirable extravagance. The twenty years that followed saw a reversal
<b>Floyd</b> | of the cultural mores which had all but done away with a fixed dining
<b>Floyd</b> | area. The net result is that this particular dining room has an
<b>Floyd</b> | uncomfortable blend of styles. A small, nondescript table shows signs
<b>Floyd</b> | of heavier wear than it was meant for. An ornate china cabinet stands
<b>Floyd</b> | in one corner, looking very out-of-place. The buffet counter, again
<b>Floyd</b> | nondescript and too small to be really serviceable, stretches across a
<b>Floyd</b> | portion of the north wall. Open archways lead south and east, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | small door is west.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Dining Room
<b>Floyd</b> | When this house was first built, conventions of style dictated a degree
<b>Floyd</b> | of spartan functionality from the dining area. The construction of this
<b>Floyd</b> | room has a sort of tacit apology built into its architecture, as if the
<b>Floyd</b> | dedication of an entire room to dining facilities was seen as an
<b>Floyd</b> | undesirable extravagance. The twenty years that followed saw a reversal
<b>Floyd</b> | of the cultural mores which had all but done away with a fixed dining
<b>Floyd</b> | area. The net result is that this particular dining room has an
<b>Floyd</b> | uncomfortable blend of styles. A small, nondescript table shows signs
<b>Floyd</b> | of heavier wear than it was meant for. An ornate china cabinet stands
<b>Floyd</b> | in one corner, looking very out-of-place. The buffet counter, again
<b>Floyd</b> | nondescript and too small to be really serviceable, stretches across a
<b>Floyd</b> | portion of the north wall. Open archways lead south and east, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | small door is west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the buffet are two oil lamps.

<b>Floyd</b> | Dive section. A number of sensors verify that you are carrying no
<b>Floyd</b> | contraband, and make a detailed record of your relevant bio-data, which
<b>Floyd</b> | is compared to your records to ensure that you are indeed the person
<b>Floyd</b> | scheduled for this dive. From your training, you know that this record
<b>Floyd</b> | will be compared again when you emerge, to ensure that nothing
<b>Floyd</b> | important about your physiology has altered during the dive. The only
<b>Floyd</b> | visible sign of it is a faint play of laser-light over your body.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Satisfied, an unseen operator opens the door into the next chamber,
<b>Floyd</b> | where a flash of laser-light, radiation, and sickly-sweet aerosol
<b>Floyd</b> | renders you free of micro-organisms.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You are allowed to move on only after placing your hand in an
<b>Floyd</b> | indentation by the next door, where ultrasonic "needles" inject you
<b>Floyd</b> | with the requisite immunity boosters, which always gives you the
<b>Floyd</b> | pleasant feeling of being, at least temporarily, totally impregnable to

<b>Floyd</b> | You stand in the core of the StreamDive Temporal Relocation Unit. Far

<b>Floyd</b> | unseeable source. There is always gooseflesh on your arms when you
<b>Floyd</b> | stand in this room. It is not a friendly room, not a relaxed room. This
<b>Floyd</b> | is a room that knows the seriousness of its function. It is far larger
<b>Floyd</b> | than anything it would ever hold, but its size is a necessity of the
<b>Floyd</b> | design. The constant, low hum of the massive generators that power the
<b>Floyd</b> | time machine is inaudible only here. The room feels like another world
<b>Floyd</b> | itself, neither part of the present nor the past.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's all in the hands of the folks upstairs now...

<b>Floyd</b> | and large, learned to overcome prejudicial assumptions about people on
<b>Floyd</b> | the basis of gender or background [Footnote 4], you know better than to
<b>Floyd</b> | jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
<b>Floyd</b> | stereotypes of their living space.
<b>Floyd</b> | Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
<b>Floyd</b> | particular thing [Footnote 5]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
<b>Floyd</b> | from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
<b>Floyd</b> | dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
<b>Floyd</b> | corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
<b>Floyd</b> | ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
<b>Floyd</b> | insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
<b>Floyd</b> | certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
<b>Floyd</b> | quarters.
<b>Floyd</b> | The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,
<b>Floyd</b> | well stocked, but uncluttered. There is a closet door on the east wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | The exit to the hall is south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the nightstand is a charger.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see a probe here.
<b>Floyd</b> | Taken.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hallway, east end
<b>Floyd</b> | You are at the east end of the main hallway on this floor. The hallway
<b>Floyd</b> | ends at a door on the east wall, and another door is north. A doorway
<b>Floyd</b> | to the south has no door, though it looks as if it were designed for
<b>Floyd</b> | one.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A framed photograph of a young man is affixed to the wall.

<b>Floyd</b> | Nook
<b>Floyd</b> | You are in a small room which you suspect has no fixed purpose. There
<b>Floyd</b> | is a table in the center of the room, with a faux-wooden chair at it,
<b>Floyd</b> | and a long bench-seat under the window. The door along the north wall
<b>Floyd</b> | has been removed, presumably in an attempt to turn the room into some

<b>Floyd</b> | Upstairs Landing
<b>Floyd</b> | The stairs from the ground floor land in the middle of a long hallway
<b>Floyd</b> | which extends east and west from your current position. There is a door
<b>Floyd</b> | in the north wall, slightly narrower than usual. From here, you can see
<b>Floyd</b> | three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hall
<b>Floyd</b> | You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
<b>Floyd</b> | purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
<b>Floyd</b> | showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
<b>Floyd</b> | and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
<b>Floyd</b> | polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
<b>Floyd</b> | hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
<b>Floyd</b> | large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the wooden table is a letter to Julia.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room
<b>Floyd</b> | The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
<b>Floyd</b> | does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
<b>Floyd</b> | room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
<b>Floyd</b> | "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
<b>Floyd</b> | video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
<b>Floyd</b> | living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
<b>Floyd</b> | an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
<b>Floyd</b> | the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
<b>Floyd</b> | a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
<b>Floyd</b> | are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
<b>Floyd</b> | the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
<b>Floyd</b> | the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
<b>Floyd</b> | closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
<b>Floyd</b> | foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Back Hallway
<b>Floyd</b> | A poorly-lit length of hallway begins here and continues west. The
<b>Floyd</b> | southern wall is open to the living room. A door leads east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A painting on the wall depicts a nautical theme.

<b>Floyd</b> | scheduled for this dive. From your training, you know that this record

<b>Floyd</b> | visible sign of it is a faint play of laser-light over your body.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Satisfied, an unseen operator opens the door into the next chamber,
<b>Floyd</b> | where a flash of laser-light, radiation, and sickly-sweet aerosol
<b>Floyd</b> | renders you free of micro-organisms.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You are allowed to move on only after placing your hand in an

<b>Floyd</b> | is a room that knows the seriousness of its function. It is far larger
<b>Floyd</b> | than anything it would ever hold, but its size is a necessity of the
<b>Floyd</b> | design. The constant, low hum of the massive generators that power the
<b>Floyd</b> | time machine is inaudible only here. The room feels like another world
<b>Floyd</b> | itself, neither part of the present nor the past.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's all in the hands of the folks upstairs now...

<b>Floyd</b> | Girl's Bedroom
<b>Floyd</b> | Coming, as you do, from an enlightened time period where man has, by

<b>Floyd</b> | the basis of gender or background [Footnote 4], you know better than to
<b>Floyd</b> | jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
<b>Floyd</b> | stereotypes of their living space.
<b>Floyd</b> | Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
<b>Floyd</b> | particular thing [Footnote 5]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
<b>Floyd</b> | from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
<b>Floyd</b> | dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
<b>Floyd</b> | corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
<b>Floyd</b> | ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
<b>Floyd</b> | insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
<b>Floyd</b> | certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
<b>Floyd</b> | quarters.
<b>Floyd</b> | The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,
<b>Floyd</b> | well stocked, but uncluttered. There is a closet door on the east wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | The exit to the hall is south.

<b>Floyd</b> | Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
<b>Floyd</b> | particular thing [Footnote 5]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
<b>Floyd</b> | from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
<b>Floyd</b> | dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the

<b>Floyd</b> | ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not

<b>Floyd</b> | Shield Breach Poses No Threat, Pentagon Says
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Today, officials at the Pentagon released a statement regarding last
<b>Floyd</b> | week's destruction of the Alaska relay station for the sub-orbital
<b>Floyd</b> | missile defense network.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Although many commentators have suggested that this breach will render
<b>Floyd</b> | the shield incapable of deflecting incoming nuclear attacks, Pentagon
<b>Floyd</b> | officials affirm that the damage to the relay station poses "no threat"
<b>Floyd</b> | to US targets.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The system was designed to deal with this sort of attack," said
<b>Floyd</b> | General Renault, director of shield operations in the northwest US,
<b>Floyd</b> | "And even with the loss of this station, other stations in the
<b>Floyd</b> | continental US and Canada will be able to cover most of the affected
<b>Floyd</b> | area. The only reduction in coverage will affect several small Alaskan
<b>Floyd</b> | islands and a limited area of northern Canada. Since these areas
<b>Floyd</b> | contain no significant military targets, the chances of this breach
<b>Floyd</b> | serving any tactical advantage to the enemy is effectively zero."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | However, not all observers are equally optimistic. Eric Blaine, of the
<b>Floyd</b> | independent nuclear defense research group at Pacific Tech, fears
<b>Floyd</b> | worse. "The shield itself is an inherently unstable system. The current
<b>Floyd</b> | implementation was secure only so long as it remained intact. Though
<b>Floyd</b> | the shield itself still covers everything but some uninhabited regions
<b>Floyd</b> | of Alaska and Canada, these areas can be made to serve as a gateway.
<b>Floyd</b> | With the weaknesses this breach has introduced in the shield, it might
<b>Floyd</b> | be possible for a missile, launched from China, to enter the shield
<b>Floyd</b> | through its weakpoint."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Pentagon officials have denied the validity of Blaine's research. An
<b>Floyd</b> | announcement from Congress later in the morning requested the
<b>Floyd</b> | disbanding of the independent nuclear defense research group.

<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room
<b>Floyd</b> | The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
<b>Floyd</b> | does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
<b>Floyd</b> | room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
<b>Floyd</b> | "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
<b>Floyd</b> | video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
<b>Floyd</b> | living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
<b>Floyd</b> | an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
<b>Floyd</b> | the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
<b>Floyd</b> | a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
<b>Floyd</b> | are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
<b>Floyd</b> | the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
<b>Floyd</b> | the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
<b>Floyd</b> | closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
<b>Floyd</b> | foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.
<b>Floyd</b> | The thief walks cautiously into the room.

<b>Floyd</b> | Dining Room
<b>Floyd</b> | When this house was first built, conventions of style dictated a degree
<b>Floyd</b> | of spartan functionality from the dining area. The construction of this
<b>Floyd</b> | room has a sort of tacit apology built into its architecture, as if the
<b>Floyd</b> | dedication of an entire room to dining facilities was seen as an
<b>Floyd</b> | undesirable extravagance. The twenty years that followed saw a reversal
<b>Floyd</b> | of the cultural mores which had all but done away with a fixed dining
<b>Floyd</b> | area. The net result is that this particular dining room has an
<b>Floyd</b> | uncomfortable blend of styles. A small, nondescript table shows signs
<b>Floyd</b> | of heavier wear than it was meant for. An ornate china cabinet stands
<b>Floyd</b> | in one corner, looking very out-of-place. The buffet counter, again
<b>Floyd</b> | nondescript and too small to be really serviceable, stretches across a
<b>Floyd</b> | portion of the north wall. Open archways lead south and east, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | small door is west.
<b>Floyd</b> | A lean and dangerous-looking man surveys the contents of the room.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the buffet are two oil lamps.

<b>Floyd</b> | well-stocked wet bar adorns a second. Couches and armchairs form a

<b>Floyd</b> | leading back to the stairway.
<b>Floyd</b> | A lean and dangerous-looking man surveys the contents of the room.

<b>Floyd</b> | recliner, the woodgrain paneling of the wall is scratched and scored

<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room
<b>Floyd</b> | The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
<b>Floyd</b> | does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
<b>Floyd</b> | room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
<b>Floyd</b> | "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
<b>Floyd</b> | video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
<b>Floyd</b> | living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
<b>Floyd</b> | an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
<b>Floyd</b> | the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
<b>Floyd</b> | a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
<b>Floyd</b> | are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
<b>Floyd</b> | the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
<b>Floyd</b> | the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
<b>Floyd</b> | closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
<b>Floyd</b> | foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.

<b>Floyd</b> | The floor fades to transparency. There is a brilliant point of light
<b>Floyd</b> | somewhere far below you. Scanning beams trace over your body. Below
<b>Floyd</b> | you, a perfect mirror image of yourself fades into existence, your
<b>Floyd</b> | avatar. You have a sinking feeling as your avatar falls toward the
<b>Floyd</b> | light. Just as you were trained, you roll back on the balls of your
<b>Floyd</b> | feet and close your eyes. In your head, you count to six. Deep down
<b>Floyd</b> | there, your avatar enters the event horizon of the artificial

<b>Floyd</b> | Kitchen
<b>Floyd</b> | In the days before all food could be prepared by an automated

<b>Floyd</b> | life. This kitchen is decorated in a country style that was archaic
<b>Floyd</b> | even when it was built. Woodgrain paneling and prominently displayed
<b>Floyd</b> | kitchenwares give the room a rustic look. The stove, refrigerator and
<b>Floyd</b> | other appliances have a more modern look, but clashing with the
<b>Floyd</b> | predominant style is kept to a minimum. Heavier items and food supplies
<b>Floyd</b> | are kept in the pantry to the west, while archways lead north and east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the refrigerator door are a report card and a receipt.

<b>Floyd</b> | The basement of this house is a simple, large room with cinderblock

<b>Floyd</b> | And something unusual. The west wall is metal, with a very large,

<b>Floyd</b> | It couldn't be. Or could it? You've never actually seen one before, but
<b>Floyd</b> | from your records...
<b>Floyd</b> | Yes. It is. It's a bomb shelter; a small room specially designed to act

<b>Floyd</b> | Bomb Shelter
<b>Floyd</b> | This is career-making stuff. A period survival shelter, fully intact

<b>Floyd</b> | materials they had available. The eastern end, nearest the exit, seems

<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, your training releases its hold over your mind and lets you

<b>Floyd</b> | 4:45 pm
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We were supposed to do it together. That was the plan.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We thought it through, talked about it over and over.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nothing else made any sense. The safety broke down. The door isn't
<b>Floyd</b> | going to open for thirty years. We can't just stay down here for thirty
<b>Floyd</b> | years. And what about her? We can't take care of that on our own.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Still, we might have tried. We might have been able to work something
<b>Floyd</b> | out. But we haven't heard anything upstairs for days. Not that you can
<b>Floyd</b> | hear much, but sometimes there's a little banging in the pipes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | That damned radio. My hand's all cut up from smashing it to bits.
<b>Floyd</b> | There's going to be an air strike. They don't know where yet, but there
<b>Floyd</b> | isn't any way to stop it. We're less than a hundred miles from the
<b>Floyd</b> | biggest military base in three states. Even if we survive, no one's
<b>Floyd</b> | going to find us. No one's going to save us.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So we decided. I unlocked the box. I took out two pills...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This is all my fault. If I hadn't been so damned paranoid, we wouldn't
<b>Floyd</b> | even be down here. It's my fault that Donna's dead. It's my fault that
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm going to be dead.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We were going to do it together. We laid down on the bed, next to each
<b>Floyd</b> | other, and she hugged me, and she told me she didn't blame me, and then
<b>Floyd</b> | we were going to bite down at the same time and it would all be over.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm such a fucking coward.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I don't think she felt anything. I hope she didn't know what a coward I
<b>Floyd</b> | am. She closed her eyes, and I closed mine, and then she just sort of
<b>Floyd</b> | shook once, and it was over. And I got up, and I laid her out flat and
<b>Floyd</b> | crossed her arms over her chest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What the fuck is wrong with me? I don't want to live. I never cared if
<b>Floyd</b> | I lived or died since the accident six years ago, and I sure as hell
<b>Floyd</b> | don't want to live down here for the next thirty years, especially now
<b>Floyd</b> | that Donna's gone. I tried to kill myself once before. All I have to do
<b>Floyd</b> | is bite down.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So why won't my hands stop shaking? I'm going to do it now. For real
<b>Floyd</b> | this time.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm not getting back into the same bed with Donna. I don't deserve
<b>Floyd</b> | that.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I hope my parents will forgive me. I hope Jim will forgive me. Most of
<b>Floyd</b> | all, though, I hope Donna will forgive me.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Goodbye.

<b>Floyd</b> | April 25
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This morning, at 7:42 AM, Congress ratified a declaration of war
<b>Floyd</b> | against an alliance of countries in the Middle East. The official
<b>Floyd</b> | reasons for this declaration were the unlawful occupation of Israel by
<b>Floyd</b> | allied Arabic forces. Nonetheless, several articles in the Global
<b>Floyd</b> | Register suppose that recent military action was motivated by trade
<b>Floyd</b> | restrictions imposed by the Arabic Alliance against Europe and the
<b>Floyd</b> | United States. These restrictions have severely limited the
<b>Floyd</b> | availability of gasoline in the US. According to the April 20 issue of
<b>Floyd</b> | the National Chronicle, the Arabic states have formed an exclusive
<b>Floyd</b> | trade pact with China. The Brandenberg News Network has run several
<b>Floyd</b> | stories saying that Chinese weapons were used in the invasion of
<b>Floyd</b> | Israel, and editorials in several newspapers claim that if the war
<b>Floyd</b> | escalates, China will enter the war on the side of the Arabic Alliance.
<b>Floyd</b> | An article in the Times says that the Chinese newspapers have already
<b>Floyd</b> | printed articles calling for war unless the US backs out of affairs in
<b>Floyd</b> | the Middle East.

<b>Floyd</b> | Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
<b>Floyd</b> | particular thing [Footnote 6]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
<b>Floyd</b> | from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
<b>Floyd</b> | dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
<b>Floyd</b> | corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
<b>Floyd</b> | ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
<b>Floyd</b> | insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
<b>Floyd</b> | certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
<b>Floyd</b> | quarters.
<b>Floyd</b> | The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,
<b>Floyd</b> | well stocked, but uncluttered. There is a closet door on the east wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | The exit to the hall is south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the nightstand is a charger.

<b>Floyd</b> | Fucking mom read my diary. Now she wants me to see a fucking shrink
<b>Floyd</b> | again. I'm not doing it. I'll be eighteen in less than a month, she
<b>Floyd</b> | can't make me. Two years they made me go after the accident. I don't
<b>Floyd</b> | fucking want to go back.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Anyway, the rest of the aftermath is that they forbade me to ever see
<b>Floyd</b> | CJ again. Like they could stop me if I wanted to. And they somehow
<b>Floyd</b> | think he's the only person I could get pot from? Mom says that he just
<b>Floyd</b> | got me stoned so he could fuck me, which is fair since I wouldn't have
<b>Floyd</b> | let him get my panties off if I'd been in a legal state of mind. Well,
<b>Floyd</b> | maybe I would've. So I told mom, It's not like he's the only guy I've
<b>Floyd</b> | ever had sex with.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Which is, of course, a lie. Everyone probably thinks I did Rob, but I
<b>Floyd</b> | didn't. He went down on me a couple of times, but before he got up the
<b>Floyd</b> | nerve to try anything more, I broke up with him coz I caught him
<b>Floyd</b> | staring at my eye while we were making out.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Even him. Most guys get freaked out by it and won't come near me.
<b>Floyd</b> | Probably think the rest of me's robotic, and it'll electrocute their...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Well anyway, I'm keeping two diaries now. This one, the legit one, I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | going to hide better. Anything really important, like this, I'll code.
<b>Floyd</b> | The other one's hidden in my room, so if anyone goes looking again,
<b>Floyd</b> | they'll stop when they find it. Maybe I'll put plants in there too, so
<b>Floyd</b> | I can tell if mom reads it again. I told her I'd fucking run away if

<b>Floyd</b> | April 18 - Jim's a bastard. He did it again. Snuck in while I was
<b>Floyd</b> | asleep and recalibrated my eye. When I woke up, I was seeing everything
<b>Floyd</b> | in infrared.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Some days I want to rip the damned thing out with my bare hands.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | April 19 - Mom won the battle of the wills. Had my first appointment
<b>Floyd</b> | with the new shrink today. Of course he's all like, We'll talk about
<b>Floyd</b> | anything you want, but of course what he really wanted to talk about
<b>Floyd</b> | was the accident. So I went through my routine, and told him how big
<b>Floyd</b> | and scary it was, and told him about getting the new eye and all that
<b>Floyd</b> | shit. And he keeps asking how things made me feel, and I tell him I
<b>Floyd</b> | don't remember, but he doesn't believe me because apparently you're
<b>Floyd</b> | supposed to remember all the fucking details when something messes up
<b>Floyd</b> | your life. I really don't remember feeling anything. Just numb. So then
<b>Floyd</b> | he asks me about CJ, and he goes on for half an hour about how drugs
<b>Floyd</b> | are bad, and sex is bad. Well, he didn't say sex is bad, of course,
<b>Floyd</b> | since they're supposed to be all about fostering a healthy attitude
<b>Floyd</b> | toward healthy adult relationships, but you get the idea. It's natural
<b>Floyd</b> | to want to express your bullshit bullshit bullshit, but it's important
<b>Floyd</b> | that you find a healthy and safe outlet bullshit bullshit. I think
<b>Floyd</b> | there was something in there about my body changing and mateuring, like
<b>Floyd</b> | I'd just hit puberty or something. Then he gave me a pamphlet about
<b>Floyd</b> | masturbation, which I guess is some kind of implication that I couldn't
<b>Floyd</b> | work it out on my own.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Anyway, mom's making me go back next week. I guess it's okay since it's
<b>Floyd</b> | her dime.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (wonder why they say "it's your dime." Why not "it's your dollar?"
<b>Floyd</b> | Makes a lot more sense. Least you can buy a pack of gum for a dollar.)

<b>Floyd</b> | places. Jim's terrified that he's gonna get drafted. There hasn't been

<b>Floyd</b> | and he wants a war to boost his popularity rating. Dad thinks he's an

<b>Floyd</b> | April 24 - Donna's back. I can't believe it. Her mom ended up in jail
<b>Floyd</b> | because her boyfriend was using her house to store his meth lab -- will
<b>Floyd</b> | you believe that? She still has her codebook after all these years.
<b>Floyd</b> | Anyway, I've written back to her, but I don't know how to find her. I
<b>Floyd</b> | guess her dad still lives near here, but he moved out of their house
<b>Floyd</b> | after the divorce. How did she find out my locker number? It'll be good
<b>Floyd</b> | to talk to her again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In other news, CJ keeps trying to talk to me. I can't risk anyone
<b>Floyd</b> | seeing us together right yet. Wish I'd come up with a code book for
<b>Floyd</b> | him, then we could talk freely at least. Maybe I can get Donna to be a
<b>Floyd</b> | go-between. There's no one else I trust.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | April 25 - Jim keeps going on about this new program he's working on.
<b>Floyd</b> | Thinks it's going to, and I quote, "set him up among the gods." He's
<b>Floyd</b> | trying to get in touch with a bunch of professors at the big-league CS
<b>Floyd</b> | schools. Thinks he's hot stuff. Dad, who really ought to know better,
<b>Floyd</b> | asked him about his new "discovery", and he went on for about an hour,
<b>Floyd</b> | not really saying anything that made much sense. The long and short of
<b>Floyd</b> | it is that he thinks he's figured out how his brain works, and he
<b>Floyd</b> | thinks he's got a way to make a computer do the same thing. Wonderful.
<b>Floyd</b> | A computer that thinks like my brother.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | April 26 - Return of the Shrink. This time he didn't ask about the
<b>Floyd</b> | accident at all. I don't know if that's a good thing. I kept getting
<b>Floyd</b> | the feeling he was looking for some good dirt about my mom beating me
<b>Floyd</b> | or dad trying to feel me up when I was six or something, like there's
<b>Floyd</b> | some deep dark secret that will magically explain why I'm so fucked up.
<b>Floyd</b> | What the hell does he want? When I was twelve, a drunk driver hit the
<b>Floyd</b> | car I was in and I broke an arm and a leg and one of my eyes got cut
<b>Floyd</b> | out. I think that might be a fair enough explanation.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Oh my god.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Donna's mom was driving. She was in the back seat with me. I think that
<b>Floyd</b> | might have been the last time I saw her.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | April 28 - I saw Donna today. She looks pretty good, except for a scar

<b>Floyd</b> | talk to her. I slipped the note I wrote in her locker. I keep telling
<b>Floyd</b> | myself I don't care if she wrties back or not. That's bullshit, of

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | April 29 - She wrote me back. Said she was afraid to talk to me because

<b>Floyd</b> | she never wrote to me before. I'm writing back to tell her I'm not
<b>Floyd</b> | angry and want to see her. I think maybe the reason I didn't remember

<b>Floyd</b> | April 30 - I finally got to talk to her. Donna just kept apologizing
<b>Floyd</b> | about the accident. I sort of got fed up and nearly walked off. I asked
<b>Floyd</b> | her about getting a note to CJ. She said she would. Talked for a long
<b>Floyd</b> | time about life and stuff. I've really missed her.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She was pretty good about it, but I caught her trying to get a good
<b>Floyd</b> | look at my eye a couple of times. It didn't bother me as much as usual.
<b>Floyd</b> | Maybe because I kept on looking at her scar.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 1 - Donna got my letter to CJ. She's none to thrilled about it,
<b>Floyd</b> | thinks he's an asshole. She's probably right, but what am I going to do
<b>Floyd</b> | about it?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I finally asked Donna about the scar, and yeah, she got it in the
<b>Floyd</b> | accident. She's really self-conscious about it, but she's not as bad as
<b>Floyd</b> | I am about my eye. I think it makes her look tough. At least she's not
<b>Floyd</b> | some kind of freak like me.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 3 - I give up. Told the doctor everything I could remember about
<b>Floyd</b> | the accident, getting the implant. Told him about CJ. Donna too, about
<b>Floyd</b> | her being in the car. Told him about talking to her recently too. Not
<b>Floyd</b> | sure why.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He asked me how I felt about the war. I don't know. They're still
<b>Floyd</b> | saying it won't last long, but we're dropping bombs all over Asia now.
<b>Floyd</b> | If it goes a couple of years, maybe they will draft Jim. I know I say a
<b>Floyd</b> | lot about him, but I don't want him to die. They won't draft me because
<b>Floyd</b> | of my eye, but they could take CJ or Donna.

<b>Floyd</b> | May 4 - I managed to convince mom to let me out of the house. Went to
<b>Floyd</b> | the mall with Donna. Was thinking about seeing CJ, but didn't want to
<b>Floyd</b> | push my luck so we just shopped.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the way back, Donna decided to push her luck and ask me about my
<b>Floyd</b> | eye. I guess she's entitled. I showed her the tuner, and told her about
<b>Floyd</b> | the stupid pranks Jim keeps pulling. I even popped it out and let her
<b>Floyd</b> | look at it close up. She thinks it's neat and asked why I don't do
<b>Floyd</b> | stuff like use it to cheat on tests by turning up the zoom. Said she
<b>Floyd</b> | thinks it's better than having a big-ass scar on her face. That kind of
<b>Floyd</b> | pissed me off. Least she looks human. Why doesn't she get it?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then she said that if it bothers me so much, I should get cosmetic
<b>Floyd</b> | contacts to cover it up. I never thought about that before.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I asked mom about getting contacts later. She said she didn't think
<b>Floyd</b> | they were safe. Of course, next week I'll be able to do as I like about
<b>Floyd</b> | it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 5 - I finally got to see CJ. Just a few minutes; Donna covered by
<b>Floyd</b> | telling mom she had to stop to pick up a prescription on the way home.
<b>Floyd</b> | We had just about enough time to pass the bowl around once and let CJ
<b>Floyd</b> | cop a couple of quick feels. We're going to get together later this
<b>Floyd</b> | week. Mom likes Donna because she's "stable", and since I haven't had
<b>Floyd</b> | any friends worth speaking of since, well, her, she can pretty much
<b>Floyd</b> | talk mom into anything. We're composing a cover story now.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 6 - You are not fucking going to believe this. They've started up
<b>Floyd</b> | the draft. And what's more? They're not taking girls. I know, they've
<b>Floyd</b> | never taken them before, but they said that they would now, since
<b>Floyd</b> | they're all "liberated" and shit.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Anyway, why aren't they taking girls, you ask? Well, there was a
<b>Floyd</b> | fucking commercial. A fucking commercial explaining how important women
<b>Floyd</b> | were to the war effort, and that's why they're not drafting them. And
<b>Floyd</b> | the way they're important to the war effort? You're gonna fucking love
<b>Floyd</b> | this -- reproduction. They're saying that it's "The duty of all
<b>Floyd</b> | citizens to make full use of their reproductive capabilities to ensure
<b>Floyd</b> | that our population remains strong and growing through these times of
<b>Floyd</b> | adversity."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What is this, the fucking dark ages? In addition to their
<b>Floyd</b> | heart-fucking-felt sermon, they've voted in a massive tax-break for
<b>Floyd</b> | families with newborns, a government handout for women who get
<b>Floyd</b> | themselves pregnant, and subsidies for unmarried women who want
<b>Floyd</b> | artificial insemination. They're also rushing through a bunch of
<b>Floyd</b> | fertility drugs that increase the chances of having twins. The got some
<b>Floyd</b> | low-level flunkie in one of the fringe groups on record saying that it
<b>Floyd</b> | was the "sworn duty of every woman to attempt conception", and that
<b>Floyd</b> | parents should encourage their daughters to get themselves knocked up
<b>Floyd</b> | as young as fifteen. They're trying to fucking breed themselves an

<b>Floyd</b> | May 7 - Oh the shit has hit the fan. There's rioting in the streets.
<b>Floyd</b> | The people who don't like the war are protesting the war. The people
<b>Floyd</b> | who don't like the draft are protesting the draft. Pretty much everyone
<b>Floyd</b> | is protesting the breeding plan, except for the ones that are lined up
<b>Floyd</b> | around the block to get a big fat shot of fertility drugs and the big
<b>Floyd</b> | fat check that goes with it. Mom's friend that works for a doctor says
<b>Floyd</b> | that they've been asked not to tie anyone's tubes or give out
<b>Floyd</b> | contraceptives anymore. I found out that Jim's stockpiling condoms, on

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | May 8 - CJ has been selected by his friends and neighbors to represent

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He acted all scared and even cried a little. I imagine this was an act

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Donna's all hot and bothered over CJ's friend Tom (I think "hot and

<b>Floyd</b> | to get blown up, he could fuck himself. Basically, I said that I wasn't
<b>Floyd</b> | going to lock myself in the 30-year deep freeze without her. He said

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He did something else weird, too. He showed me how to open the lock box

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I think he knows that the lead-lined casket in the basement isn't

<b>Floyd</b> | bed with my eyes closed, making the firm decision not to get out of bed
<b>Floyd</b> | until dinner, and she came in around one in the afternoon and asked if
<b>Floyd</b> | she could lay down with me. She got in bed and just lay there for a

<b>Floyd</b> | get her to talk about it, but she didn't say anything. Just lay there
<b>Floyd</b> | sobbing for about three hours. Then, she just got up, thanked me, and

<b>Floyd</b> | Now that the big points are out of the way, I'll get on to the details.
<b>Floyd</b> | Rusty isn't big on wild parties; it was just me and Donna and him and a
<b>Floyd</b> | couple of his friends siting around and drinking. After a couple of
<b>Floyd</b> | games of Beiruit, Donna needed help standing so she could throw the
<b>Floyd</b> | ball. She said she wanted to lie down for a while, so Rusty let me
<b>Floyd</b> | carry her to his sister's room -- she moved out a year ago. I was going
<b>Floyd</b> | to leave her for a while and go back to the party, but she asked me to
<b>Floyd</b> | stay. So I sit on the bed, and she's kind of hanging on me, and about
<b>Floyd</b> | twenty minutes go by, and then she tells me. Actually, she tells my
<b>Floyd</b> | arm, which is where her head was. She was way late so she got a
<b>Floyd</b> | pregnancy test from the drug store and however many lines showed up. So
<b>Floyd</b> | now I know why she's been so weird. I tell her that she shouldn't
<b>Floyd</b> | worry, and she has to take the test again to be sure, and maybe she
<b>Floyd</b> | should see her doctor. But of course her doctor's in Oklahoma, and she
<b>Floyd</b> | doesn't want anyone to know. She asks if I know anyone who can take
<b>Floyd</b> | care of it, because she won't keep it, and she hears that they're
<b>Floyd</b> | paying off abortion doctors to not take any patients, and they keep
<b>Floyd</b> | geting bombed by the war-baby people anyway, but of course I don't. So
<b>Floyd</b> | she cries for a while and hugs me and stuff, and she tells me how
<b>Floyd</b> | scared she is. I tell her that I'll do whatever she needs. I don't have
<b>Floyd</b> | a whole lot of money, because CJ was making me pay for pot most of the
<b>Floyd</b> | time, but I could sneak a bunch of shit from my parents, now that mom's
<b>Floyd</b> | got everything hidden, so if she needs cash to pay for it, I could do
<b>Floyd</b> | that. Or anything else she needs from me. She just wants me to keep
<b>Floyd</b> | holding her while she cries, so I do. And after a while she wants to
<b>Floyd</b> | lie down, so we do, and we just sort of cuddle for a while. She calms
<b>Floyd</b> | down some, so she starts talking about her mom, except she keeps
<b>Floyd</b> | calling her a coked-up whore. She talks some about her dad too, and how
<b>Floyd</b> | she thinks he's going to die.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | SYNC
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Eventually I ask her if she's told Tom. She hasn't, of course, since
<b>Floyd</b> | he's off in boot camp, and she's not going to tell him because she
<b>Floyd</b> | doesn't want him having that on his head when he goes off to die for
<b>Floyd</b> | his country. While we're lying there, I get to thinking. I've always
<b>Floyd</b> | thought I was so alone, but then I think about Donna, and her coked-up
<b>Floyd</b> | whore mom in jail, her dad and her boyfriend going off to play
<b>Floyd</b> | soldiers. She says I'm just about the only friend she has in the world
<b>Floyd</b> | which is just about what I'm thinking at this point. And she sort of
<b>Floyd</b> | puts her hand behind my head and starts kind of playing with my hair. I
<b>Floyd</b> | start to get the feeling that she wants me to kiss her, but I'm not
<b>Floyd</b> | sure whether it's the booze or the loneliness, or the being afraid, or
<b>Floyd</b> | what, so I'm not sure it's a good idea even if I want to, which I'm not
<b>Floyd</b> | sure of either, but she takes matters into her own hands and kisses me.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I kissed Donna one time when we were thirteen, on a dare, but it was
<b>Floyd</b> | just, you know, the kind of kiss you do on a dare. This was serious. It
<b>Floyd</b> | was a good kiss, as close as I can tell. I'm not gay or anything, I
<b>Floyd</b> | don't think, but it was still a good kiss. She didn't say anything
<b>Floyd</b> | afterward, just went back to crying until she fell asleep. I think this
<b>Floyd</b> | is as far as it's going, which is good.

<b>Floyd</b> | ball. She said she wanted to lie down for a while, so Rusty let me
<b>Floyd</b> | carry her to his sister's room -- she moved out a year ago. I was going
<b>Floyd</b> | to leave her for a while and go back to the party, but she asked me to
<b>Floyd</b> | stay. So I sit on the bed, and she's kind of hanging on me, and about
<b>Floyd</b> | twenty minutes go by, and then she tells me. Actually, she tells my
<b>Floyd</b> | arm, which is where her head was. She was way late so she got a
<b>Floyd</b> | pregnancy test from the drug store and however many lines showed up. So
<b>Floyd</b> | now I know why she's been so weird. I tell her that she shouldn't
<b>Floyd</b> | worry, and she has to take the test again to be sure, and maybe she
<b>Floyd</b> | should see her doctor. But of course her doctor's in Oklahoma, and she
<b>Floyd</b> | doesn't want anyone to know. She asks if I know anyone who can take
<b>Floyd</b> | care of it, because she won't keep it, and she hears that they're
<b>Floyd</b> | paying off abortion doctors to not take any patients, and they keep
<b>Floyd</b> | geting bombed by the war-baby people anyway, but of course I don't. So
<b>Floyd</b> | she cries for a while and hugs me and stuff, and she tells me how
<b>Floyd</b> | scared she is. I tell her that I'll do whatever she needs. I don't have
<b>Floyd</b> | a whole lot of money, because CJ was making me pay for pot most of the
<b>Floyd</b> | time, but I could sneak a bunch of shit from my parents, now that mom's
<b>Floyd</b> | got everything hidden, so if she needs cash to pay for it, I could do
<b>Floyd</b> | that. Or anything else she needs from me. She just wants me to keep
<b>Floyd</b> | holding her while she cries, so I do. And after a while she wants to
<b>Floyd</b> | lie down, so we do, and we just sort of cuddle for a while. She calms
<b>Floyd</b> | down some, so she starts talking about her mom, except she keeps
<b>Floyd</b> | calling her a coked-up whore. She talks some about her dad too, and how
<b>Floyd</b> | she thinks he's going to die.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | SYNC
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Eventually I ask her if she's told Tom. She hasn't, of course, since
<b>Floyd</b> | he's off in boot camp, and she's not going to tell him because she
<b>Floyd</b> | doesn't want him having that on his head when he goes off to die for
<b>Floyd</b> | his country. While we're lying there, I get to thinking. I've always
<b>Floyd</b> | thought I was so alone, but then I think about Donna, and her coked-up
<b>Floyd</b> | whore mom in jail, her dad and her boyfriend going off to play
<b>Floyd</b> | soldiers. She says I'm just about the only friend she has in the world
<b>Floyd</b> | which is just about what I'm thinking at this point. And she sort of
<b>Floyd</b> | puts her hand behind my head and starts kind of playing with my hair. I
<b>Floyd</b> | start to get the feeling that she wants me to kiss her, but I'm not
<b>Floyd</b> | sure whether it's the booze or the loneliness, or the being afraid, or
<b>Floyd</b> | what, so I'm not sure it's a good idea even if I want to, which I'm not
<b>Floyd</b> | sure of either, but she takes matters into her own hands and kisses me.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I kissed Donna one time when we were thirteen, on a dare, but it was
<b>Floyd</b> | just, you know, the kind of kiss you do on a dare. This was serious. It
<b>Floyd</b> | was a good kiss, as close as I can tell. I'm not gay or anything, I
<b>Floyd</b> | don't think, but it was still a good kiss. She didn't say anything
<b>Floyd</b> | afterward, just went back to crying until she fell asleep. I think this
<b>Floyd</b> | is as far as it's going, which is good.

<b>Floyd</b> | Girl's Bedroom
<b>Floyd</b> | Coming, as you do, from an enlightened time period where man has, by
<b>Floyd</b> | and large, learned to overcome prejudicial assumptions about people on
<b>Floyd</b> | the basis of gender or background [Footnote 5], you know better than to
<b>Floyd</b> | jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
<b>Floyd</b> | stereotypes of their living space.
<b>Floyd</b> | Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
<b>Floyd</b> | particular thing [Footnote 6]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
<b>Floyd</b> | from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
<b>Floyd</b> | dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
<b>Floyd</b> | corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
<b>Floyd</b> | ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
<b>Floyd</b> | insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
<b>Floyd</b> | certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
<b>Floyd</b> | quarters.
<b>Floyd</b> | The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,
<b>Floyd</b> | well stocked, but uncluttered. There is a closet door on the east wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | The exit to the hall is south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the nightstand is a charger.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The viewpoint of the camera suggests that the wearer is seated in front
<b>Floyd</b> | of a portable computer. Her hand reaches out and picks up a small
<b>Floyd</b> | device beside the computer. She turns it over, presumably examining it
<b>Floyd</b> | from all angles. The hand turns the device until its barrel-end points
<b>Floyd</b> | directly into the camera. A finger twitches, pressing a button. A flash
<b>Floyd</b> | of light issues from the end of the device, and the image flickers,
<b>Floyd</b> | distorts, and breaks up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When the image returns, the device has been dropped to the table. The
<b>Floyd</b> | wearer stands, and the camera reels in unsteady ascent. Again a hand
<b>Floyd</b> | reaches out, this time to switch the computer off. It takes a small red
<b>Floyd</b> | pill from the table, and then moves to the wearer's mouth.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The camera turns quickly, and moves toward one of the bunked beds. It
<b>Floyd</b> | focuses on the motionless body of a beautiful blonde girl. The image
<b>Floyd</b> | switches to infrared, showing the characteristic cooling of a recently
<b>Floyd</b> | deceased body, then the camera changes back to the visual spectrum. The
<b>Floyd</b> | camera bobs up and down, as if slowly nodding. It moves toward the face
<b>Floyd</b> | of the dead girl, and stays very close to one cheek for a long time.
<b>Floyd</b> | The camera withdraws, and the wearer extends a hand, tracing the
<b>Floyd</b> | shoulder and arm of the corpse, finally coming to rest atop the folded
<b>Floyd</b> | hands. The wearer's hand squeezes the dead hands once, then the camera
<b>Floyd</b> | turns toward the opposite cot.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The camera moves toward the cot, then turns and lowers, finally
<b>Floyd</b> | pitching back as the wearer lies down. A hand moves toward the camera,
<b>Floyd</b> | and as it passes in front of it, the recording ends.

<b>Floyd</b> | A framed photograph of a young man is affixed to the wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | This image shows a young man in his mid-teens. He sports a pathetic

<b>Floyd</b> | adolescence, he apparently does know, at least, how to pose for a
<b>Floyd</b> | photograph. He has a very slight smile, and a look of interested
<b>Floyd</b> | curiosity on his face. He does show the awkward pockmarks of severe
<b>Floyd</b> | acne, made worse by the extreme fullness of his face. He is wearing a
<b>Floyd</b> | black shirt with a suede vest, which bears a small lapel pin, of the
<b>Floyd</b> | sort distributed by academic honor societies.

<b>Floyd</b> | Boy's Bedroom
<b>Floyd</b> | Of all the rooms you've seen so far, this bedroom shows the least signs
<b>Floyd</b> | of having been tidied before the house was abandoned. Naturally, of
<b>Floyd</b> | course, this heightens your curiosity; untidy rooms generally tell you
<b>Floyd</b> | more than clean ones. From the space-shuttle wallpaper, you suspect
<b>Floyd</b> | that this room belonged to a young child, though it might simply imply
<b>Floyd</b> | that the room is long-overdue for renovation. There is a bookcase along
<b>Floyd</b> | one wall, containing model space ships, toy robots, and a very few
<b>Floyd</b> | books. A desk beside the door is loaded down with computer equipment.
<b>Floyd</b> | The most interesting feature of the room is the floor; while most of
<b>Floyd</b> | the other rooms have had wall-to-wall carpeting, this room has what
<b>Floyd</b> | appears to be industrial grade linoleum tile. The hallway lies west.

<b>Floyd</b> | Hallway, east end
<b>Floyd</b> | You are at the east end of the main hallway on this floor. The hallway

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Upstairs Landing
<b>Floyd</b> | The stairs from the ground floor land in the middle of a long hallway
<b>Floyd</b> | which extends east and west from your current position. There is a door
<b>Floyd</b> | in the north wall, slightly narrower than usual. From here, you can see
<b>Floyd</b> | three doors at each of the two ends of the hallway.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hallway, west end
<b>Floyd</b> | The upstairs hallway begins here, or ends here, depending on your point
<b>Floyd</b> | of view. You can see where the stairway meets the hall to the east, and
<b>Floyd</b> | doors are located along the north, south, and west walls.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A framed photograph of a young woman graces one wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | The image shows a young woman dressed in simplified academic regalia.
<b>Floyd</b> | She wears a formless gown in an unflattering blue pastel with a
<b>Floyd</b> | mortarboard cap. The girl in the picture looks about the right age for
<b>Floyd</b> | this photograph to be commemorating a high school graduation, though
<b>Floyd</b> | there are signs that she might be older; her expression is one of
<b>Floyd</b> | world-weariness, and her disapproving frown merges into lines on the
<b>Floyd</b> | face which suggest that this is an accustomed expression. You imagine
<b>Floyd</b> | that she would be quite attractive, if not for the scowl which seems to
<b>Floyd</b> | be permanently burnt into her face.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An unnatural reflection causes you to notice her right eye, which,
<b>Floyd</b> | under close scrutiny, is apparently artificial. Though the prosthesis
<b>Floyd</b> | is good enough to pass for the real thing under casual scrutiny, it
<b>Floyd</b> | does lack the bloodshot look of the left eye, and you can make out the
<b>Floyd</b> | segmentation of a mechanical iris. If the color had been a better match
<b>Floyd</b> | for her left eye, you might well not have noticed.
<b>Floyd</b> | [The document "Graduation Photograph" has been added to your

<b>Floyd</b> | Master Bedroom
<b>Floyd</b> | Generally speaking, you learn more from a dirty house than a clean one;

<b>Floyd</b> | about the day-to-day affairs of the occupants. You can tell that
<b>Floyd</b> | whoever lived here had some warning before they evacuated, time enough
<b>Floyd</b> | to at least do some preliminary straightening up. The bed, which is
<b>Floyd</b> | opposite the door, under the smaller of the room's two windows, is
<b>Floyd</b> | neatly made, the wastepaper basket between the door and the dresser is
<b>Floyd</b> | empty, and the two night tables on either side of the bed are both
<b>Floyd</b> | clean and freshly polished. A full-length mirror hangs on a door to the

<b>Floyd</b> | Generally speaking, you learn more from a dirty house than a clean one;

<b>Floyd</b> | to at least do some preliminary straightening up. The bed, which is
<b>Floyd</b> | opposite the door, under the smaller of the room's two windows, is
<b>Floyd</b> | neatly made, the wastepaper basket between the door and the dresser is
<b>Floyd</b> | empty, and the two night tables on either side of the bed are both
<b>Floyd</b> | clean and freshly polished. A full-length mirror hangs on a door to the
<b>Floyd</b> | north. The hallway is east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see an autokey here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hallway, west end
<b>Floyd</b> | The upstairs hallway begins here, or ends here, depending on your point
<b>Floyd</b> | of view. You can see where the stairway meets the hall to the east, and

<b>Floyd</b> | Term used to describe the period from September to November of the
<b>Floyd</b> | old-calendar year 2102. Reconstruction after the wars of the previous
<b>Floyd</b> | century left most of the world in the debt of seventeen
<b>Floyd</b> | megacorporations. On September 12, 2102 (old date), the
<b>Floyd</b> | megacorporations foreclosed on the collective nations of the world, and
<b>Floyd</b> | assumed legal control of the planet. They were met with little
<b>Floyd</b> | resistance from world populations, who had grown dissatisfied with the
<b>Floyd</b> | national governments. Though their leadership was able to provide rapid
<b>Floyd</b> | improvement of living conditions for many inhabitants, the task of
<b>Floyd</b> | managing an entire planet proved too much for the megacorporations, who
<b>Floyd</b> | soon discovered that the world as a whole could not be run profitably.
<b>Floyd</b> | After several administrative fiascoes, the most notable of which
<b>Floyd</b> | involved the firing and eviction from Earth of the entire population of
<b>Floyd</b> | Canada, the corporate consortium itself declared bankruptcy exactly 70
<b>Floyd</b> | days after its inception, thrusting the world into anarchy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The United Earth Directorate quickly arose to fill the infrastructure
<b>Floyd</b> | created by the consortium, becoming the first true one-world

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | This is a magazine whose articles showcase current events in the
<b>Floyd</b> | scientific community. It is written to a target audience of educated,
<b>Floyd</b> | but not scientifically trained, readers.
<b>Floyd</b> | You browse through the magazine, looking for anything of interest. You
<b>Floyd</b> | are not disappointed. There is a short article, all the way at the
<b>Floyd</b> | back, summarizing the doctoral thesis of one Emmanuel Kaldeki.
<b>Floyd</b> | This is quite a find; Kaldeki's original thesis has long been lost, and
<b>Floyd</b> | it has long been assumed that he had not pursued the line of research
<b>Floyd</b> | that would eventually lead to StreamDive technology until after the
<b>Floyd</b> | war. You read the article...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Physicist Emmanuel Kaldeki created a buzz in the scientific world early
<b>Floyd</b> | this month with the delivery of his PhD thesis, "Mathematical Modeling
<b>Floyd</b> | of Non-Temporal Quantum Particles" at the Pacific Institute of
<b>Floyd</b> | Technology. The paper describes a set of mathematical formulae which
<b>Floyd</b> | model a theoretical particle called "Q-omega". The Q-omega particle,
<b>Floyd</b> | according to Kaldeki's model, behaves in most respects like a
<b>Floyd</b> | strange-matter quark, but also exhibits properties previously only
<b>Floyd</b> | modeled in tachyons. Specifically, it reacts in unusual ways to
<b>Floyd</b> | space-time curvature. The Kaldeki model suggests that that at
<b>Floyd</b> | relativistic velocities, the Q-omega particle would "plane" on highly
<b>Floyd</b> | curved space-time, in much the same way that the hull of a speed boat
<b>Floyd</b> | planes over water.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Most of the excitement over Kaldeki's paper comes not from the modeling
<b>Floyd</b> | technique itself, but from the two major example models included. The
<b>Floyd</b> | first demonstrates how the non-temporal nature of the Q-omega particle
<b>Floyd</b> | renders it immune from the effects of time and mass dilation occurring
<b>Floyd</b> | at speeds near that of light. Indeed, because of their unique nature,
<b>Floyd</b> | the model shows that Q-omega particles can be accelerated above the
<b>Floyd</b> | speed of light, a possibility generally disallowed by the theory of
<b>Floyd</b> | relativity.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The second, and more impressive example studies the behavior of Q-omega
<b>Floyd</b> | in the vicinity of a black hole. Under such extreme space-time
<b>Floyd</b> | curvature, Kaldeki predicts that the Q-omega particle would completely
<b>Floyd</b> | disassociate itself with conventional space-time, being displaced along
<b>Floyd</b> | a predictable path to some distant point in the universe
<b>Floyd</b> | instantaneously. Because the path of the particle does not go through
<b>Floyd</b> | space-time during this journey, it is possible for Q-omega to re-enter
<b>Floyd</b> | normal space at a point in time prior to its departure.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The scientific community is excited about the implications of this
<b>Floyd</b> | theory: several researchers have suggested that Kaldeki's findings may
<b>Floyd</b> | open the way to faster-than-light travel, matter transmission, and time
<b>Floyd</b> | travel. Asked about these possibilities, Kaldeki said, "I think it's a
<b>Floyd</b> | bit early to start talking about applications; we don't even know yet
<b>Floyd</b> | if the particles I've modeled can be created. There's nothing in the
<b>Floyd</b> | mathematics that would prohibit [these applications], but actually
<b>Floyd</b> | doing it is a long way off. You've got to remember, we're talking about
<b>Floyd</b> | sub-atomic particles, and if we could scale the effect to something the
<b>Floyd</b> | size of, say, a man, it's not very likely that a living creature could
<b>Floyd</b> | survive being moved around like that."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Kaldeki has received a grant for an undisclosed amount to pursue the
<b>Floyd</b> | fabrication of these particles. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy in
<b>Floyd</b> | Quantum Physics will be conferred upon Emmanuel Kaldeki by the Pacific
<b>Floyd</b> | Institute of Technology during commencement exercises next month.

<b>Floyd</b> | Back Hallway
<b>Floyd</b> | A poorly-lit length of hallway begins here and continues west. The
<b>Floyd</b> | southern wall is open to the living room. A door leads east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A painting on the wall depicts a nautical theme.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Behind the Stairs
<b>Floyd</b> | The ceiling over this stretch of hallway slopes upward where the stairs
<b>Floyd</b> | cut into it. Along the south wall, just before the ceiling becomes too
<b>Floyd</b> | low to make a serviceable hallway, a low, louvered door marks a small
<b>Floyd</b> | closet. The hallway continues east, and to the west it ends in an
<b>Floyd</b> | archway leading to the dining room.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Dining Room
<b>Floyd</b> | When this house was first built, conventions of style dictated a degree
<b>Floyd</b> | of spartan functionality from the dining area. The construction of this
<b>Floyd</b> | room has a sort of tacit apology built into its architecture, as if the
<b>Floyd</b> | dedication of an entire room to dining facilities was seen as an
<b>Floyd</b> | undesirable extravagance. The twenty years that followed saw a reversal
<b>Floyd</b> | of the cultural mores which had all but done away with a fixed dining
<b>Floyd</b> | area. The net result is that this particular dining room has an
<b>Floyd</b> | uncomfortable blend of styles. A small, nondescript table shows signs
<b>Floyd</b> | of heavier wear than it was meant for. An ornate china cabinet stands
<b>Floyd</b> | in one corner, looking very out-of-place. The buffet counter, again
<b>Floyd</b> | nondescript and too small to be really serviceable, stretches across a
<b>Floyd</b> | portion of the north wall. Open archways lead south and east, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | small door is west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the buffet are two oil lamps.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see a photograph here.
<b>Floyd</b> | This is apparently a visual of the family that lived in this house. In
<b>Floyd</b> | the back stand two adults, a man whose receding hair looks unnaturally
<b>Floyd</b> | dark, wearing thick, horn-rimmed eyeglasses, and a woman, much shorter,
<b>Floyd</b> | who looks about the same age. She too wears glasses, with a more
<b>Floyd</b> | fashionable wire frame. Her front teeth, visible in what looks like an
<b>Floyd</b> | unaccustomed smile, are stained and crooked. A small scar is visible
<b>Floyd</b> | near the corner of her mouth. Before them are two children. On the
<b>Floyd</b> | right, a boy about ten, has a ridiculous smile and equally ridiculous
<b>Floyd</b> | bowl-cut. Beside him is a girl, probably a few years his senior. You
<b>Floyd</b> | aren't sure, but you think you see a glint of something reflective near
<b>Floyd</b> | her temple, where her hair is awkwardly combed over a bald patch. Her
<b>Floyd</b> | eyes are not quite the same color, though that may be a blemish on the
<b>Floyd</b> | photograph. There does certainly seem to be something odd about her
<b>Floyd</b> | right eye, but you can't tell on a photograph this size.

<b>Floyd</b> | Hall
<b>Floyd</b> | You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
<b>Floyd</b> | purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
<b>Floyd</b> | showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
<b>Floyd</b> | and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room
<b>Floyd</b> | The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
<b>Floyd</b> | does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
<b>Floyd</b> | room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
<b>Floyd</b> | "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
<b>Floyd</b> | video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
<b>Floyd</b> | living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
<b>Floyd</b> | an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
<b>Floyd</b> | the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
<b>Floyd</b> | a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
<b>Floyd</b> | are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
<b>Floyd</b> | the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
<b>Floyd</b> | the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
<b>Floyd</b> | closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
<b>Floyd</b> | foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.
<b>Floyd</b> | That door is locked.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You manage to unlock the door with the autokey.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room Closet
<b>Floyd</b> | This was originally a walk-in closet, but with the quantity of items
<b>Floyd</b> | which have accumulated here, it has become more of a stand-in closet.
<b>Floyd</b> | You are sure that if the building weren't doomed, it would eventually
<b>Floyd</b> | have turned into a lean-in closet. Between the well-stocked coat rod
<b>Floyd</b> | and a number of boxes, there is just enough room for you to turn around
<b>Floyd</b> | if you feel like returning west to the living room.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the coat rod are a winter coat (in which is a sales brochure), a
<b>Floyd</b> | light jacket (empty), a windbreaker (empty), a gray suitcoat (empty), a

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Arcotech shelters are:
<b>Floyd</b> |  *PAATO approved for use in emergency situations
<b>Floyd</b> |  *designed for use with concrete or earth coverings, or as above-ground
<b>Floyd</b> | shelters
<b>Floyd</b> |  *built from a heavily-tested, original, patented design
<b>Floyd</b> |  *tested successfully in full, one-third, and one-quarter scale models
<b>Floyd</b> | by the US Army Corps of Engineers, US Air Force, and Pacific Institute
<b>Floyd</b> | of Technology Engineering Sciences Laboratory
<b>Floyd</b> |  *available in a large range of sizes to accommodate many different
<b>Floyd</b> | needs
<b>Floyd</b> |  *equipped with the latest in survival equipment and fully stocked with
<b>Floyd</b> | supplies meeting the FWPSC 1.2037 standard for long-term survival
<b>Floyd</b> |  *installable in most existing homes and buildings
<b>Floyd</b> |  *fully customizable to meet specific user needs and concerns
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This booklet details just a few of the many survival features
<b>Floyd</b> | available. Contact your Arcotech Sales Representative for a full list
<b>Floyd</b> | of features, special options recommended in your area, and pricing
<b>Floyd</b> | information.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Construction
<b>Floyd</b> | Arcotech shelters are built with the highest degree of precision
<b>Floyd</b> | technology to provide optimal support and security. Shelter roofs and
<b>Floyd</b> | walls are built from high-tech steel corrugated arch panels to ensure
<b>Floyd</b> | maximum strength and load-bearing. The corrugated design allows
<b>Floyd</b> | high-quality seals between arch panels so that shelters can be built of
<b>Floyd</b> | any length.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Arcotech shelters come standard with heavy steel endwalls. For added
<b>Floyd</b> | protection, concrete endwall reinforcements are available. Due to the
<b>Floyd</b> | patented interlocking all-steel design, additional layers of protection
<b>Floyd</b> | can be added to the arch or endwalls.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For the ultimate in radiation protection, lead insulating sheets may be
<b>Floyd</b> | added.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | All Arcotech shelters come with a reinforced heavy steel door. Thick
<b>Floyd</b> | security bolts ensure that the shelter cannot be breached. Many
<b>Floyd</b> | Arcotech shelters include a secondary egress hatch, which can be
<b>Floyd</b> | installed in the roof with a minimal reduction in structural integrity.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Life-support Equipment
<b>Floyd</b> | Arcotech shelters include the latest in high-endurance life support
<b>Floyd</b> | equipment. All Arcotech shelters are equipped with both secure
<b>Floyd</b> | ventilation systems for processing outside air, and with an advanced
<b>Floyd</b> | air recycling system. In emergencies, the shelter can be sealed and
<b>Floyd</b> | operate entirely on stored air reserves for up to six months at a time.
<b>Floyd</b> | When outside air is safe for use, it can be used to replenish internal
<b>Floyd</b> | supplies in a matter of hours.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The water recycling system standard on Arcotech shelters is able to
<b>Floyd</b> | provide adequate, safe water supplies over extended periods. With
<b>Floyd</b> | strict water rationing, the shelter is able to recycle approximately
<b>Floyd</b> | 85% of its stored water. Optional accessories include facilities for
<b>Floyd</b> | collecting and purifying water from surface runoff and underground
<b>Floyd</b> | deposits. The standard water storage system included with each Arcotech
<b>Floyd</b> | shelter contains sufficient reserves for three months of use. With
<b>Floyd</b> | water recycling and collection, usable water may be replenished
<b>Floyd</b> | indefinitely.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sanitation and waste-disposal facilities in Arcotech Shelters are
<b>Floyd</b> | second to none. The low-energy waste incinerator reduces all human and
<b>Floyd</b> | other waste products to compact ash, which is stored in the insecure
<b>Floyd</b> | waste pit. Waste pit capacities vary with space availability, but are
<b>Floyd</b> | generally large enough to store several years worth of waste.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The standard equipment for Arcotech home survival shelters includes a
<b>Floyd</b> | 30-year supply of nonperishable food stocks designed to meet all
<b>Floyd</b> | nutritional needs. Users with infants and small children are advised to
<b>Floyd</b> | consider ordering the optional child nutrition supplement.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In addition for stocks of first-aid supplies, the medical stores
<b>Floyd</b> | standard in Arcotech shelters include medical equipment and medicine
<b>Floyd</b> | for treating minor maladies and injuries, along with detailed, useful
<b>Floyd</b> | information on their use. To foster adequate health and morale, most
<b>Floyd</b> | shelters are capable of increasing the normally dim lights to output
<b>Floyd</b> | sun-like spectra for limited periods. By using this feature several
<b>Floyd</b> | times a week, occupants can avoid depression and diseases caused by
<b>Floyd</b> | lack of sunlight.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Arcotech shelters are powered by a patented high-performance chemical
<b>Floyd</b> | induction system, which can deliver operating power to the shelter for
<b>Floyd</b> | at least 30 years without replenishment. For above-ground shelters,
<b>Floyd</b> | solar power cells are also available. The energy source is suitably
<b>Floyd</b> | shielded from EMP effects which may accompany nuclear attacks.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Accommodations
<b>Floyd</b> | Arcotech home survival shelters come standard with accommodations for
<b>Floyd</b> | families of four, six, eight, and twelve persons. Accommodations for
<b>Floyd</b> | larger groups may be custom ordered.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Standard accommodations include comfortable, high-durability bedding
<b>Floyd</b> | with optional privacy screens, a dining and utility table with chairs,
<b>Floyd</b> | personal storage compartments, and durable survival clothing. Efficient
<b>Floyd</b> | kitchen, laundry, and toilet facilities are also provided, as is a
<b>Floyd</b> | privacy-screen area for low-water washing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Because of the importance of maintaining morale during an extended
<b>Floyd</b> | stay, Arcotech shelters also contain minimal facilities for relaxation,
<b>Floyd</b> | exercise, and entertainment. All non-value-line models of Arcotech
<b>Floyd</b> | shelters include a "relaxation area", consisting of a foldable couch
<b>Floyd</b> | (which may be raised to form an exercise area), small television with
<b>Floyd</b> | video and music player, and storage space large enough to contain a
<b>Floyd</b> | small library or children's toys.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Security/Survival
<b>Floyd</b> | All Arcotech shelters are equipped with the following minimal equipment
<b>Floyd</b> | to facilitate survival in times of crisis. Many other options are
<b>Floyd</b> | available. Contact your Arcotech Sales Representative for a full list
<b>Floyd</b> | of features recommended in your area.
<b>Floyd</b> |  *Easy-to-use radiation meters
<b>Floyd</b> |  *Two 30" 22 mag. cal. single-action rifles and ammunition for personal
<b>Floyd</b> | defense and hunting
<b>Floyd</b> |  *Shortwave radio and transmitter
<b>Floyd</b> |  *Desktop computer with wireless network connection
<b>Floyd</b> |  *"Panic" locking mechanism: Shelter egress can be secured so that its
<b>Floyd</b> | entryway cannot be opened from inside for a specified time, or until
<b>Floyd</b> | radiation levels are safe, to prevent early egress in the event an
<b>Floyd</b> | occupant becomes unreasonable
<b>Floyd</b> |  *Cyanide capsules: stored in a locked box, also fitted with a panic
<b>Floyd</b> | locking mechanism, are provided as a painless alternative to radiation
<b>Floyd</b> | sickness or degenerative illness
<b>Floyd</b> |  *Government approved survival instructions: Arcotech is the only
<b>Floyd</b> | shelter manufacturer to equip each shelter with all of the Federal
<b>Floyd</b> | Government's latest survival instruction booklets. Other manufacturers
<b>Floyd</b> | often use dangerously out-of-date materials, some nearly a century old
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Arcotech: Your Life May Depend On It
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You notice that the document mentions nothing about protection from
<b>Floyd</b> | photo-nuclear weapons. Though the document is grossly limited in its
<b>Floyd</b> | treatment of technical considerations, you quickly realize that such a
<b>Floyd</b> | shelter would not provide adequate protection from even non-nuclear
<b>Floyd</b> | attacks closer than a few dozen kilometers away. Its primary utility
<b>Floyd</b> | rests in protecting its occupants from residual radiation released by
<b>Floyd</b> | fallout from a distant bomb strike. Of course, a far less opulent
<b>Floyd</b> | shelter would still provide adequate defense under such circumstances.

<b>Floyd</b> | Hallway, west end
<b>Floyd</b> | The upstairs hallway begins here, or ends here, depending on your point

<b>Floyd</b> | Sealed Room
<b>Floyd</b> | You are in a small, dark room that appears to have been unused for
<b>Floyd</b> | years. The only feature worth noting is a wooden ladder which leads to
<b>Floyd</b> | an opening in the ceiling. The exit is north.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Attic
<b>Floyd</b> | There is barely enough room to stand upright in the attic. It certainly
<b>Floyd</b> | looks too small to be of much use for storage. It's nearly impossible
<b>Floyd</b> | to move without clocking yourself on a supporting beam.

<b>Floyd</b> | By now, the political alliance of European and American countries is

<b>Floyd</b> | The war will be ended when Space Station Kennedy crashes near the
<b>Floyd</b> | Chinese capital city.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | However, the war can be ended more quickly, and with a reduced loss of
<b>Floyd</b> | life if nuclear weapons from the United States can be effectively
<b>Floyd</b> | deployed in the Chinese mainland. The defensive screen which prevents
<b>Floyd</b> | nuclear weapons from reaching Chinese soil uses a simple 512-bit
<b>Floyd</b> | identification code to differentiate between friendly and unfriendly
<b>Floyd</b> | missiles. If a nuclear missile were to transmit the data sequence
<b>Floyd</b> | generated by the Plotnitz-Leibkin algorithm at a frequency of 906.4
<b>Floyd</b> | MHz, Chinese countermeasures would mistake the missile for a Chinese
<b>Floyd</b> | launch, and would be unable to eradicate it before it reached its

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hallway, east end
<b>Floyd</b> | You are at the east end of the main hallway on this floor. The hallway

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Girl's Bedroom
<b>Floyd</b> | Coming, as you do, from an enlightened time period where man has, by
<b>Floyd</b> | and large, learned to overcome prejudicial assumptions about people on
<b>Floyd</b> | the basis of gender or background [Footnote 5], you know better than to
<b>Floyd</b> | jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
<b>Floyd</b> | stereotypes of their living space.
<b>Floyd</b> | Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
<b>Floyd</b> | particular thing [Footnote 6]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
<b>Floyd</b> | from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
<b>Floyd</b> | dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
<b>Floyd</b> | corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
<b>Floyd</b> | ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
<b>Floyd</b> | insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
<b>Floyd</b> | certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
<b>Floyd</b> | quarters.
<b>Floyd</b> | The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,
<b>Floyd</b> | well stocked, but uncluttered. There is a closet door on the east wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | The exit to the hall is south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the nightstand is a charger.

<b>Floyd</b> | Walk-in Closet
<b>Floyd</b> | From the architecture of the house, you can tell that this is the only
<b>Floyd</b> | bedroom to have its own walk-in closet, which no doubt was an issue of
<b>Floyd</b> | some discussion when bedrooms were assigned. The majority of the closet
<b>Floyd</b> | is taken up by clothing, but you can see a few boxes toward the back.

<b>Floyd</b> | Historical Period: ca 865600-866300 UDC
<b>Floyd</b> | Historical Period: ca 865600-866300 UDC
<b>Floyd</b> | Possibly the darkest period in recent history, this period contains the
<b>Floyd</b> | last and largest of the intercontinental wars. Several Middle Eastern
<b>Floyd</b> | nations formed a military alliance, and began imposing expansionist
<b>Floyd</b> | policies on neighboring countries. When the United States threatened to
<b>Floyd</b> | cut off trade relations with these countries, the formed a lucrative
<b>Floyd</b> | trade alliance with China. Because during this period, industrialized
<b>Floyd</b> | nations were still highly dependent on fossil fuel, an alliance of
<b>Floyd</b> | western nations declared war on China and the Arabic alliance. Tactical
<b>Floyd</b> | nuclear warheads were used by both sides, resulting in the near-total
<b>Floyd</b> | annihilation of many US-sympathetic countries in southeast Asia. Though
<b>Floyd</b> | US nuclear weapons were unable to breach Chinese countermeasures,
<b>Floyd</b> | several Chinese nuclear missiles did penetrate the US defensive system,
<b>Floyd</b> | obliterating a number of cities. The war was finally ended when the
<b>Floyd</b> | massive space station Kennedy crashed to Earth near the Chinese
<b>Floyd</b> | capital. The resulting explosion killed over two billion people,
<b>Floyd</b> | forcing the Chinese government to capitulate. However, widespread
<b>Floyd</b> | environmental and war damage left the entire world badly crippled.
<b>Floyd</b> | Reconstruction would take much of the next century, and the extensive
<b>Floyd</b> | costs of rebuilding the damaged world forced the beginning of
<b>Floyd</b> | governmental alliances that would eventually lead to a United Earth
<b>Floyd</b> | Government.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your mission occurs during the opening of the nuclear phase of the war.
<b>Floyd</b> | At 785278.83 UDC, a missile launched from China will exploit the breach
<b>Floyd</b> | in the US missile shield. Nine hours later, its course will be diverted
<b>Floyd</b> | away from Washington, DC to avoid US countermeasures. It will narrowly
<b>Floyd</b> | miss a secondary target, several miles from your Dive site, at 865741.8
<b>Floyd</b> | UDC.

<b>Floyd</b> | Space Station Kennedy
<b>Floyd</b> | Space Station Kennedy
<b>Floyd</b> | The first orbital platform intended for permanent occupation, Space
<b>Floyd</b> | Station Kennedy was assembled in Earth orbit in the second quarter of
<b>Floyd</b> | the twenty-first century. Compared with earlier projects, Kennedy was
<b>Floyd</b> | ambitious; it contained living facilities for twenty-five families,
<b>Floyd</b> | and, unlike earlier space stations, its primary function was not
<b>Floyd</b> | scientific, but industrial. Methods of zero-gravity production which
<b>Floyd</b> | had previously been tested on earlier space missions were implemented
<b>Floyd</b> | on a grand scale. It was also the first space vehicle to be equipped
<b>Floyd</b> | with a synthetic gravity system. After two decades of service, the
<b>Floyd</b> | station was badly damaged during the intercontinental war of the mid
<b>Floyd</b> | twenty-first century. Its crew were not able to prevent a forced
<b>Floyd</b> | re-entry, and chose to direct the crashing space station to a heavily
<b>Floyd</b> | inhabited area of China. Everyone aboard the station was killed in the
<b>Floyd</b> | resulting explosion, which also resulted in severe environmental
<b>Floyd</b> | catastrophes in Asia, prompting the end of the war.

<b>Floyd</b> | Girl's Bedroom
<b>Floyd</b> | Coming, as you do, from an enlightened time period where man has, by
<b>Floyd</b> | and large, learned to overcome prejudicial assumptions about people on
<b>Floyd</b> | the basis of gender or background [Footnote 5], you know better than to
<b>Floyd</b> | jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
<b>Floyd</b> | stereotypes of their living space.
<b>Floyd</b> | Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
<b>Floyd</b> | particular thing [Footnote 6]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
<b>Floyd</b> | from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
<b>Floyd</b> | dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
<b>Floyd</b> | corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
<b>Floyd</b> | ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
<b>Floyd</b> | insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
<b>Floyd</b> | certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
<b>Floyd</b> | quarters.
<b>Floyd</b> | The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,
<b>Floyd</b> | well stocked, but uncluttered. There is a closet door on the east wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | The exit to the hall is south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the nightstand is a charger.

<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room
<b>Floyd</b> | The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
<b>Floyd</b> | does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
<b>Floyd</b> | room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
<b>Floyd</b> | "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
<b>Floyd</b> | video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
<b>Floyd</b> | living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
<b>Floyd</b> | an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
<b>Floyd</b> | the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
<b>Floyd</b> | a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
<b>Floyd</b> | are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
<b>Floyd</b> | the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
<b>Floyd</b> | the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
<b>Floyd</b> | closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
<b>Floyd</b> | foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.

<b>Floyd</b> | Dining Room
<b>Floyd</b> | When this house was first built, conventions of style dictated a degree
<b>Floyd</b> | of spartan functionality from the dining area. The construction of this
<b>Floyd</b> | room has a sort of tacit apology built into its architecture, as if the
<b>Floyd</b> | dedication of an entire room to dining facilities was seen as an
<b>Floyd</b> | undesirable extravagance. The twenty years that followed saw a reversal
<b>Floyd</b> | of the cultural mores which had all but done away with a fixed dining
<b>Floyd</b> | area. The net result is that this particular dining room has an
<b>Floyd</b> | uncomfortable blend of styles. A small, nondescript table shows signs
<b>Floyd</b> | of heavier wear than it was meant for. An ornate china cabinet stands
<b>Floyd</b> | in one corner, looking very out-of-place. The buffet counter, again
<b>Floyd</b> | nondescript and too small to be really serviceable, stretches across a
<b>Floyd</b> | portion of the north wall. Open archways lead south and east, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | small door is west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the buffet are two oil lamps.

<b>Floyd</b> | Kitchen
<b>Floyd</b> | In the days before all food could be prepared by an automated
<b>Floyd</b> | processing unit, the kitchen was often considered the center of family
<b>Floyd</b> | life. This kitchen is decorated in a country style that was archaic
<b>Floyd</b> | even when it was built. Woodgrain paneling and prominently displayed
<b>Floyd</b> | kitchenwares give the room a rustic look. The stove, refrigerator and
<b>Floyd</b> | other appliances have a more modern look, but clashing with the
<b>Floyd</b> | predominant style is kept to a minimum. Heavier items and food supplies
<b>Floyd</b> | are kept in the pantry to the west, while archways lead north and east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the refrigerator door are a report card and a receipt.

<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room
<b>Floyd</b> | The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
<b>Floyd</b> | does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
<b>Floyd</b> | room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
<b>Floyd</b> | "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
<b>Floyd</b> | video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
<b>Floyd</b> | living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
<b>Floyd</b> | an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
<b>Floyd</b> | the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
<b>Floyd</b> | a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
<b>Floyd</b> | are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
<b>Floyd</b> | the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
<b>Floyd</b> | the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
<b>Floyd</b> | closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
<b>Floyd</b> | foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room Closet
<b>Floyd</b> | This was originally a walk-in closet, but with the quantity of items
<b>Floyd</b> | which have accumulated here, it has become more of a stand-in closet.
<b>Floyd</b> | You are sure that if the building weren't doomed, it would eventually
<b>Floyd</b> | have turned into a lean-in closet. Between the well-stocked coat rod
<b>Floyd</b> | and a number of boxes, there is just enough room for you to turn around
<b>Floyd</b> | if you feel like returning west to the living room.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the coat rod are a winter coat (in which is a sales brochure), a
<b>Floyd</b> | light jacket (empty), a windbreaker (empty), a gray suitcoat (empty), a
<b>Floyd</b> | black suitcoat (empty) and a smoking jacket (empty).

<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room
<b>Floyd</b> | The very name "living room" is a subject of some consideration: what
<b>Floyd</b> | does it mean to be a "room for living". Obviously, one "lives" in every
<b>Floyd</b> | room of a house. Practically speaking, during this time period, the
<b>Floyd</b> | "living room" was the room in which one entertained guests, watched
<b>Floyd</b> | video transmissions, and interacted with family. Nevertheless, the
<b>Floyd</b> | living room was primarily the adults' domain. This living room is not
<b>Floyd</b> | an exception. The atmosphere is one of maturity; the lack of wear on
<b>Floyd</b> | the furniture and prominence of fragile art objects suggests that it is
<b>Floyd</b> | a room not accustomed to children's play. A couch and several armchairs
<b>Floyd</b> | are arranged in a rough semicircle, a superficial attempt at creating
<b>Floyd</b> | the illusion that its occupants are generally interested in
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation rather than watching the screen, which one assumes is in
<b>Floyd</b> | the cabinet situated along the southern wall. The louvered doors of a
<b>Floyd</b> | closet are set in the east wall, and the wall opposite opens into the
<b>Floyd</b> | foyer. Along the north wall, a section opens into another hallway.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hall
<b>Floyd</b> | You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
<b>Floyd</b> | purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
<b>Floyd</b> | showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
<b>Floyd</b> | and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
<b>Floyd</b> | polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
<b>Floyd</b> | hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
<b>Floyd</b> | large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the wooden table is a letter to Julia.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Kitchen
<b>Floyd</b> | In the days before all food could be prepared by an automated
<b>Floyd</b> | processing unit, the kitchen was often considered the center of family
<b>Floyd</b> | life. This kitchen is decorated in a country style that was archaic
<b>Floyd</b> | even when it was built. Woodgrain paneling and prominently displayed
<b>Floyd</b> | kitchenwares give the room a rustic look. The stove, refrigerator and
<b>Floyd</b> | other appliances have a more modern look, but clashing with the
<b>Floyd</b> | predominant style is kept to a minimum. Heavier items and food supplies
<b>Floyd</b> | are kept in the pantry to the west, while archways lead north and east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the refrigerator door are a report card and a receipt.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Pantry
<b>Floyd</b> | This is a small room, designed to hold food staples and cooking
<b>Floyd</b> | equipment not housed in the kitchen. You doubt you'll find anything
<b>Floyd</b> | worthwhile in here, but you've been a StreamDiver long enough to know
<b>Floyd</b> | better than to trust appearances. You can return east to the kitchen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Shelves line the walls, sparsely stocked.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the shelves are some pots and pans, a lazy susan (empty), a flour
<b>Floyd</b> | pot (closed) and a can of spiced ham (closed).

<b>Floyd</b> | Dining Room
<b>Floyd</b> | When this house was first built, conventions of style dictated a degree

<b>Floyd</b> | undesirable extravagance. The twenty years that followed saw a reversal
<b>Floyd</b> | of the cultural mores which had all but done away with a fixed dining
<b>Floyd</b> | area. The net result is that this particular dining room has an
<b>Floyd</b> | uncomfortable blend of styles. A small, nondescript table shows signs
<b>Floyd</b> | of heavier wear than it was meant for. An ornate china cabinet stands
<b>Floyd</b> | in one corner, looking very out-of-place. The buffet counter, again

<b>Floyd</b> | Girl's Bedroom
<b>Floyd</b> | Coming, as you do, from an enlightened time period where man has, by

<b>Floyd</b> | the basis of gender or background [Footnote 5], you know better than to
<b>Floyd</b> | jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
<b>Floyd</b> | stereotypes of their living space.
<b>Floyd</b> | Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
<b>Floyd</b> | particular thing [Footnote 6]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
<b>Floyd</b> | from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
<b>Floyd</b> | dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
<b>Floyd</b> | corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
<b>Floyd</b> | ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
<b>Floyd</b> | insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
<b>Floyd</b> | certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
<b>Floyd</b> | quarters.
<b>Floyd</b> | The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,

<b>Floyd</b> | Guys, we've got a problem. Like, a BIG problem.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I was watching the feed from Coach Lynch's eye today after school,
<b>Floyd</b> | right? So she's in her office after practice and Libby Sikes comes in,
<b>Floyd</b> | ok? And they're talking for a while, but I can't hear what they're
<b>Floyd</b> | saying, of course. After a while, Lynchzilla shuts the door, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | couple of minutes later, she's feeling Libby up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I ran the video by Marty, since he's deaf and reads lips. From Libby's
<b>Floyd</b> | side of it, it looks like she's gonna get cut from the team, on account
<b>Floyd</b> | of she sucks ass at field hockey. And, we're not too sure on this, but
<b>Floyd</b> | it looks like Lynch is gonna let her stay on the team if she fucks her.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lynch should go to jail for fucking a student, but no one but us knows
<b>Floyd</b> | about it, and all the proof we got is this recording, so if we give it
<b>Floyd</b> | to the cops, we'll be in the cell right next to her. We should never
<b>Floyd</b> | have done this.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So what should we do?

<b>Floyd</b> | books. A desk beside the door is loaded down with computer equipment.
<b>Floyd</b> | The most interesting feature of the room is the floor; while most of

<b>Floyd</b> | Originally an outgrowth of a research project in distributed document
<b>Floyd</b> | storage, the "LibertyNet Protocol" became widely used among less
<b>Floyd</b> | legitimate members of the digital subculture in the mid 21st century.
<b>Floyd</b> | The system propagated documents in a semi-anonymous manner so that
<b>Floyd</b> | users could choose to release a document which could not be traced back
<b>Floyd</b> | to an owner, and was similar to the earlier "freenet" project. Though
<b>Floyd</b> | originally intended a method for free expression in countries lacking
<b>Floyd</b> | legal protection of free speech, it quickly degenerated into a
<b>Floyd</b> | marketplace for the exchange of pornography, bootleg music, and stolen
<b>Floyd</b> | computer software. Numerous attempts by various governments to shut
<b>Floyd</b> | down LibertyNet were mostly unsuccessful and increased its underground
<b>Floyd</b> | appeal. LibertyNet was eventually made obsolete by the Global Dataweb.

<b>Floyd</b> | That door is locked.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You manage to unlock the door with the autokey.

<b>Floyd</b> | Hall Closet
<b>Floyd</b> | Although the primary function of this room seems to be as a linen
<b>Floyd</b> | closet, its size suggests that it was intended for even heavier
<b>Floyd</b> | storage. Three of the walls bear shelves, neatly stocked with towels

<b>Floyd</b> | Girl's Bedroom
<b>Floyd</b> | Coming, as you do, from an enlightened time period where man has, by
<b>Floyd</b> | and large, learned to overcome prejudicial assumptions about people on
<b>Floyd</b> | the basis of gender or background [Footnote 5], you know better than to
<b>Floyd</b> | jump to conclusions about the occupant based on the cultural
<b>Floyd</b> | stereotypes of their living space.
<b>Floyd</b> | Nevertheless, you can always tell a girl's room. It isn't some
<b>Floyd</b> | particular thing [Footnote 6]; rather, an air of femininity issues more
<b>Floyd</b> | from the juxtaposition of objects than the contents themselves. The
<b>Floyd</b> | dollhouse; the partially completed watercolor on an easel in the
<b>Floyd</b> | corner; the ornate, hand-carved chest at the foot of the bed; the paper
<b>Floyd</b> | ribbons affixed to the vent cover on the floor, all suggest, but do not
<b>Floyd</b> | insist that the occupant of this room is female. And yet, there is a
<b>Floyd</b> | certain something about this space that rarely arises in a man's
<b>Floyd</b> | quarters.
<b>Floyd</b> | The walls are a soft, uniform pastel. The desk stands opposite the bed,
<b>Floyd</b> | well stocked, but uncluttered. There is a closet door on the east wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | The exit to the hall is south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the nightstand is a charger.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see two keys (a simple key and an antique key), a prosthetic
<b>Floyd</b> | eye, a real diary, a code book and a fake diary here.

<b>Floyd</b> | Hall
<b>Floyd</b> | You are in the main entryway of the house. Aside from its functional
<b>Floyd</b> | purpose as the central hub of the building, it also serves as a
<b>Floyd</b> | showcase of the owner's prowess as a decorator. This room is tasteful
<b>Floyd</b> | and ornate. A coatrack stands abandoned in a corner, beside a highly
<b>Floyd</b> | polished small wooden table. The front door is due south, and the
<b>Floyd</b> | hallway opens west onto the kitchen, and east to the living room. A
<b>Floyd</b> | large staircase to the north leads up to the second floor, and down.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the wooden table is a letter to Julia.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Kitchen
<b>Floyd</b> | In the days before all food could be prepared by an automated
<b>Floyd</b> | processing unit, the kitchen was often considered the center of family
<b>Floyd</b> | life. This kitchen is decorated in a country style that was archaic
<b>Floyd</b> | even when it was built. Woodgrain paneling and prominently displayed
<b>Floyd</b> | kitchenwares give the room a rustic look. The stove, refrigerator and
<b>Floyd</b> | other appliances have a more modern look, but clashing with the
<b>Floyd</b> | predominant style is kept to a minimum. Heavier items and food supplies
<b>Floyd</b> | are kept in the pantry to the west, while archways lead north and east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the refrigerator door are a report card and a receipt.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Pantry
<b>Floyd</b> | This is a small room, designed to hold food staples and cooking
<b>Floyd</b> | equipment not housed in the kitchen. You doubt you'll find anything
<b>Floyd</b> | worthwhile in here, but you've been a StreamDiver long enough to know
<b>Floyd</b> | better than to trust appearances. You can return east to the kitchen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Shelves line the walls, sparsely stocked.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the shelves are some pots and pans, a lazy susan (empty), a flour
<b>Floyd</b> | pot (closed) and a can of spiced ham (closed).

<b>Floyd</b> | The StreamDive console emits an audible warning: "Alert: Dive time
<b>Floyd</b> | expired. Discharging temporal capacitors."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | All at once, the universe goes away. Time itself cries out in distress,
<b>Floyd</b> | and every cell in your body echoes its cry. The laws of physics cannot
<b>Floyd</b> | be broken, but they can be bent, if only for a time. As the energy
<b>Floyd</b> | stored in your temporal capacitors discharges, time reasserts itself.
<b>Floyd</b> | If you were the sort to anthopomorphize physical law, you'd say that it
<b>Floyd</b> | was extracting some revenge against you for daring to transcend the
<b>Floyd</b> | barriers of time. Of course, all that you're really experiencing is a
<b>Floyd</b> | form of severe disorientation resulting from the unusual perceptual
<b>Floyd</b> | stimuli occurring outside normal time-space. It all goes away in a
<b>Floyd</b> | nothingth of a second, and you stumble backward to the floor of the
<b>Floyd</b> | StreamDive Core. White-clad technicians swarm into the chamber a second
<b>Floyd</b> | later, helping you into the postDive examination, which confirms that
<b>Floyd</b> | you have weathered the Dive intact, and cleanses ancient toxins from
<b>Floyd</b> | your system. Your possessions are taken for examination, and you are
<b>Floyd</b> | led to the debriefing room.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | StreamDive Debriefing room
<b>Floyd</b> | You are in a comfortably small room, used to debrief StreamDivers
<b>Floyd</b> | following their missions. The room is intentionally designed to avoid
