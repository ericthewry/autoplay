The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Baby Uncle New Year</i>, written by Jonathan Blask. <I>Baby Uncle New Year</I> was originally released as part of the Even Newer New Years Speed IFs.   was part of the seventieth collection of Speed IFs (can you believe it?).  You can learn more about all the games in the Even Newer New Year's Speed, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Even_Newer_New_Year's_Speed_IF'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> |    It must be said- 2010 gone done you wrong. You lost employment,
<b>Floyd</b> | friends, love. Without so much as a silver lining, the year was more
<b>Floyd</b> | like an endless golden shower. It was a half-empty cup containing
<b>Floyd</b> | spoiled milk. It has been a swirling turd for which there has been no
<b>Floyd</b> | positive spin. To describe the year with a phrase that came out of it,

<b>Floyd</b> | 2010 has eaten "a hot bowl of Dicks."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    In late December, though, things changed wehn you became an uncle.
<b>Floyd</b> | That single, humble birth hatched a glorious idea- a dash of right
<b>Floyd</b> | time with a sprinkle of right place and voil?! A freshly-appointed
<b>Floyd</b> | Baby New Year nephew could be your meal ticket, and 2011 would be your

<b>Floyd</b> | oyster. Nepotism, bitches!!

<b>Floyd</b> | Main Lobby
<b>Floyd</b> |   It took some doing, but you finally found New Year's Pole, the place
<b>Floyd</b> | Where It All Starts (and ends). You would have given this small island
<b>Floyd</b> | off the coast of New Zealand a pass if it weren't for its sizeable
<b>Floyd</b> | building fully-equipped with television satellite. You'd bet your
<b>Floyd</b> | unshakable faith in worn-out stereotypes that Old Man New Year loves

<b>Floyd</b> | himself some "Matlock."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Anyhow, now you're in the main lobby of that building. A directory
<b>Floyd</b> | tells you that there is a "Baby Room" to the northeast, a "TV Lounge"
<b>Floyd</b> | to the northwest, and a "Sash Ceremony Stage Area" to the north.
<b>Floyd</b> | Furthermore, a large banner has been erected over the exit to the

<b>Floyd</b> | south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You are carrying a baby.

<b>Floyd</b> | Baby Room
<b>Floyd</b> |   This room seems to be where Baby New Year hangs out before the big

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |   A crib is here. A little sign on it denotes the occupant as "Future

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    The crib is currently empty. You hear a bell chime.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;the hell?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Suddenly, a delivery man- guess that chime was from an unseen delivery
<b>Floyd</b> | door- barges into the room, carrying a baby (presumably the successor
<b>Floyd</b> | to the New Year throne). As he gently places the baby in the crib, he
<b>Floyd</b> | glances in your direction. His eyes go wide as he sees the baby in

<b>Floyd</b> | your arms.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He straightens up and addresses you, "Aw, geez fella. If that baby is
<b>Floyd</b> | what I think it is, you guys must have received a duplicate shipment.
<b>Floyd</b> | Here, take this." He hands you a business card. "I can't take this
<b>Floyd</b> | baby back without the right paperwork. Call corporate and tell them

<b>Floyd</b> | about the duplicate shipment, and they'll send me to take this guy
<b>Floyd</b> | back, no questions asked."
<b>Floyd</b> |
