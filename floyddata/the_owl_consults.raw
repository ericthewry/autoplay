						The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each
						week at a pre-arranged time, a group of
						people meet online to cooperatively play
						a game of interactive fiction.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>The Owl Consults</em> written by Thomas Mack, Nick Mathewson, and Cidney Hamilton.
						It took 6th place in the 23rd Annual Interactive Fiction Competition (2017). 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting

					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Good afternoon, Owl. Or good morning, evening, or night, since I
<b>Floyd</b> | shouldn't care to hazard a guess as to your time zone.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But be that as it may. It is I, Amelia Derringer! I flatter myself to
<b>Floyd</b> | think that you may have heard of me; I'm the infamous thief who has
<b>Floyd</b> | been delighting and terrorizing England for three years now. As you
<b>Floyd</b> | undoubtedly know, I'm no ordinary sneak-thief. I became a cat burglar
<b>Floyd</b> | after acquiring an uncanny ability to shape-shift. All I need to do is
<b>Floyd</b> | eat a bit of an animal, and I can harness some small fraction of its
<b>Floyd</b> | special powers. It's served me well in my many successful burglaries,
<b>Floyd</b> | and I've acquired a reputation as a master thief, along with a lot of
<b>Floyd</b> | other people's money.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But now I'm in a bit of a pickle, you know. Here I am, suspended in a
<b>Floyd</b> | cage over a slavering octopus. It's not something that would
<b>Floyd</b> | ordinarily confound me, of course, but I'm afraid I've mislaid my bag
<b>Floyd</b> | of thief tools---or rather, I had it mislaid for me by one of Rex
<b>Floyd</b> | Dashing's confounded robots. If it's not too much of a bother, would
<b>Floyd</b> | you be so kind as provide some sort of advice? I'd rather like to
<b>Floyd</b> | escape this cage, make my way through the airship, and help myself to
<b>Floyd</b> | a few cuttings of the Telepathic God-Slug of Madagascar. My research
<b>Floyd</b> | indicates that Rex Dashing keeps its body somewhere about his airship.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle i">Aquarium</span> (in the steel cage)
<b>Floyd</b> | As cliché as it is, I'm trapped in a cage being slowly lowered into a
<b>Floyd</b> | tank. This particular tank is at least occupied by a vicious octopus
<b>Floyd</b> | rather than a horde of piranhas or sharks, which I suppose is at least
<b>Floyd</b> | mildly original. There is a prominent red button on the wall here,
<b>Floyd</b> | tantalizingly out of reach. There's also an exit south and a trapdoor
<b>Floyd</b> | overhead, though neither one is going to be useful to me until I get
<b>Floyd</b> | out of this accursed cage.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One of the tentacles of that dratted beast is slurping over the edge
<b>Floyd</b> | of the cage! I trust you have something clever in mind.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With my newfound rubberiness, I think I should be able to slip through
<b>Floyd</b> | the bars. Let me just twist...and...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Capital! I've just squeezed through the bars and gracefully
<b>Floyd</b> | somersaulted onto the ground below. It's a shame you couldn't have
<b>Floyd</b> | seen it, Owl; it really was a magnificent feat of dexterity.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now that the immediate threat has passed, I should elaborate on my
<b>Floyd</b> | mission. I managed to sneak about the Mephistopheles in order to steal
<b>Floyd</b> | the elusive Telepathic God-Slug of Madagascar, a rare creature whose
<b>Floyd</b> | secretions have an intense pacifying effect on anyone who comes into
<b>Floyd</b> | contact with them. If I obtained the slug and ate it---just a nibble,
<b>Floyd</b> | mind you, not enough to kill it---then I could use my shapeshifting
<b>Floyd</b> | powers to harness that effect for myself. The Slug has no loftier
<b>Floyd</b> | ambitions for its power than confusing predators, but I plan to use it
<b>Floyd</b> | to establish a new world of peace and cooperation. With the power to
<b>Floyd</b> | affect the psychology of a few chosen leaders of industry and
<b>Floyd</b> | government, I could eliminate war entirely and bring about a pacifist
<b>Floyd</b> | utopia over which I have complete control---to the best possible ends,
<b>Floyd</b> | of course.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | That was the idea, anyway. While I was bantering with Dashing over
<b>Floyd</b> | dinner, I accidentally tipped my hand. I don't think he ever realized
<b>Floyd</b> | the significance of the God-Slug; to him, it was just another trophy
<b>Floyd</b> | from his adventures. He figured out I was up to something, though, and
<b>Floyd</b> | had his robots drag me down here and---well, you know the rest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I need your help, Owl, to complete my mission. I want to find the
<b>Floyd</b> | God-Slug of Madagascar and safely escape the ship. I was told that
<b>Floyd</b> | you're the best in the business. Let's see what you can do.

<b>Floyd</b> | Ah, yes! Spectacular! Professor Dirk Radon, the IRRADIATABLE MAN, is
<b>Floyd</b> | once again free from the constraints of gravity! The bleating mass of
<b>Floyd</b> | humanity said it couldn't be done, but once again I've proved them
<b>Floyd</b> | WRONG with my ATOMIC JETPACK. As enjoyable as it is to whoosh through
<b>Floyd</b> | the air, though, I have a mission to complete. Once I'm back on the
<b>Floyd</b> | airship and out of the clutches of my treacherous robots, I'll explain
<b>Floyd</b> | in a bit more detail. Let me gently land on the main deck...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Excellent! Disregard the crash you may have heard, Owl; that was just
<b>Floyd</b> | me gently brushing up against a bookcase during my VICTORY DANCE on
<b>Floyd</b> | having accomplished such a perfect landing. And no, there is of course
<b>Floyd</b> | no bookcase on the main deck of the ship. Instead, I used my
<b>Floyd</b> | SPECTACULAR INTELLECT to reroute to a side room off the main deck
<b>Floyd</b> | because...well, to gain the element of surprise. My plan is running
<b>Floyd</b> | smoothly and COMPLETELY ACCORDING TO PLAN.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Ah, yes, my plan. I'm sure you've been wondering, Owl, how a feckless
<b>Floyd</b> | idiot like Dashing could have such a technical marvel at his disposal.
<b>Floyd</b> | He didn't design or build it himself, of course; this is MY AIRSHIP.
<b>Floyd</b> | This is MY SHIP, MY ROBOTS, and MY NUCLEAR REACTOR. The last point is
<b>Floyd</b> | the most important one. Dashing stole my airship and has been trying
<b>Floyd</b> | to pass it off as its own, but that won't do him any good if it's
<b>Floyd</b> | destroyed in a FIERY NUCLEAR EXPLOSION. My plan is to sabotage the
<b>Floyd</b> | reactor and destroy the ship, then safely escape. That way, I can
<b>Floyd</b> | challenge him to rebuild it; it would be easy for him if he truly
<b>Floyd</b> | designed it in the first place. He didn't, of course, and I can expose
<b>Floyd</b> | his perfidy and incompetence when I rebuild my PERFECT AIRSHIP. Then
<b>Floyd</b> | the world will be laughing at the ridiculous "Captain" Dashing, and I
<b>Floyd</b> | will use my rebuilt ROBOT ARMY to crush him and then crush the WORLD!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is, of course, a perfect plan; now I just need to carry it out. As
<b>Floyd</b> | you undoubtedly know, I possess an uncanny immunity to radiation,
<b>Floyd</b> | which helps me immensely as a NUCLEAR SCIENTIST. My main ability,
<b>Floyd</b> | though is my amazing intelligence. I've been told, Owl, that you are
<b>Floyd</b> | the only person capable of matching my own staggering intellect. Let's
<b>Floyd</b> | see what you can do.

<b>Floyd</b> | I have returned to the cold room of the airship, where I would conduct

<b>Floyd</b> | Huzzah, the monster is slain! Another GLORIOUS VICTORY for genius
<b>Floyd</b> | scientist DIRK RADON! I've hacked it into a series of gelatinous
<b>Floyd</b> | pieces, which have oozed into the floor. Mostly, anyway; there's a bit
