The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>The Day I Stabbed Stalin</i>, written by Taleslinger.  <I>The Day I Stabbed Stalin</I> was originally released as part of the 2009-10 (increasingly misnomed) Newer New Year's Speed IF.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php?title=The_Day_I_stabbed_...'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Dear Blogreaders,
<b>Floyd</b> |  I think we can all agree it has been a weird year. It's so cool that
<b>Floyd</b> | we could replace all our technology with Alien Tech (tm) from those

<b>Floyd</b> | UFOs that crashed last year. And just think of the last three weeks -
<b>Floyd</b> | the governors daughter abducted, and then, sudden and unrelated, this
<b>Floyd</b> | state allows gay marriage after all. Good for Paul and me! I heard the
<b>Floyd</b> | news when  I returned from my three weeks trip to Europe. I rushed to
<b>Floyd</b> | his New Year's Party, and, well, after the last two years, I had a
<b>Floyd</b> | hunch that this could turn into

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Day I stabbed Stalin
<b>Floyd</b> | An interactive Party by Taleslinger
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 1 / Serial number 091225 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib
<b>Floyd</b> | 6/12N)
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Paul, his hair cropped short and dyed deep blue, awaits you at the
<b>Floyd</b> | door. "Alex! How was Europe?"
<b>Floyd</b> |  "Fine! How is the party?"
<b>Floyd</b> | "Good, good."
<b>Floyd</b> | He gives you a long, sensitive hug, which usually means he wants to
<b>Floyd</b> | annoy you.

<b>Floyd</b> | "I invited a lot of people, to help you socialize -like Uncle Wally! I
<b>Floyd</b> | had to, after you accidentally (Paul puts a lot of *acid* in that
<b>Floyd</b> | word) sent him that Thomson's Gazelle last year. And even those nice
<b>Floyd</b> | Dagon Cultists from next door. So try and behave yourself, 'kay?"
<b>Floyd</b> | "I always try! I even made a cupcake." You hand Paul the single,
<b>Floyd</b> | small, crumpled and black thing, sole survivor of another kitchen

<b>Floyd</b> | fiasco. That gets you a soft giggle and Paul disappears. You really
<b>Floyd</b> | wonder how he manages to stay away from you on a three room party.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | hallway
<b>Floyd</b> | A small hallway, brightly lit by a row of Alien Tech(tm) powered neon
<b>Floyd</b> | lights. Dark wooden stairs lead upwards, and a doorframe opens east

<b>Floyd</b> | into the Living Room. A small door under the stairs lead into a
<b>Floyd</b> | storage closet. (Referred to by Paul only as "The Potter Room".)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see a chest of drawers (closed) here.

<b>Floyd</b> | Garden Area

<b>Floyd</b> | Pauls Parents are rather fond of this small pool. It's surrounded by

<b>Floyd</b> | seamelss tan. This wasn't necessary for the southern wall, wich is
<b>Floyd</b> | quite high, because it borders on a Golf course (Pauls told you they

<b>Floyd</b> | Garden Area
<b>Floyd</b> | Pauls Parents are rather fond of this small pool. It's surrounded by
<b>Floyd</b> | some deck-chairs. The eastern and western garden walls are overgrown

<b>Floyd</b> | seamelss tan. This wasn't necessary for the southern wall, wich is
<b>Floyd</b> | quite high, because it borders on a Golf course (Pauls told you they
