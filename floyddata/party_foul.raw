The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Party Foul</i>, written by Brooks Reeves.  <I>Party Foul</I> was originally released as part of Casual Gameplay Design Competition 7, where it took fourth place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Party_Foul'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.
