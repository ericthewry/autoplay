					<span class="fontish smaller">Like ClubFloyd, the idea behind NightFloyd is that a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.<br><br>Unlike ClubFloyd, NightFloyd often takes on significantly larger works of interactive fiction, knowing going in that each one will take multiple sessions (but not always, as you'll see in this transcript). NightFloyd is also a bit more informal than ClubFloyd in that it's only announced on the ifMUD #clubfloyd bulletin board, and the time shifts around to meet player's schedules far more than ClubFloyd does. NightFloyd is organized by genericgeekgirl, aka Adri.<br>

						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Toby's Nose</em> written by Chandler Groover.
						It was the winner of the Main Festival in the 2015 Spring Thing.

					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing this game, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never

<b>Floyd</b> | "Now, ladies and gentlemen, here are the facts," Holmes begins. "At

<b>Floyd</b> | light the fire."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "That is correct," replies the butler.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You were also the last person to see Gerald Argente alive yesterday

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "That is also correct."

<b>Floyd</b> | and keep smelling smells within smells. In fact, since you'll be doing
<b>Floyd</b> | so much smelling, simply entering S works as a shortcut for SMELL.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You may not be able to collect physical evidence, but you'll always
<b>Floyd</b> | remember important clues in your mental inventory once you've smelled
<b>Floyd</b> | them.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When you think you've figured out the murderer, then Holmes wants you
<b>Floyd</b> | to BARK AT (somebody) to indicate their guilt. Scotland Yard will take
<b>Floyd</b> | over from there.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The drawing-room is filled with sights and scents, and some are
<b>Floyd</b> | references. You could toggle FOOTNOTES ON to see their sources, but
<b>Floyd</b> | then that might spoil the fun, wouldn't it?

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You'll excuse me if I fail to appreciate why there is a dog in my
<b>Floyd</b> | drawing-room," interrupts Lady Argente. "It seems entirely unnecessary,
<b>Floyd</b> | not to mention unsanitary."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I will excuse you, madam. Ignorance should always be answered with
<b>Floyd</b> | compassion. The dog in question is none other than the great Toby. He
<b>Floyd</b> | has sniffed out more criminals in his day than most policemen could
<b>Floyd</b> | hope to catch in a career. That is because I have trained him myself."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Of course," the captain says, "any measure that you deem important to
<b>Floyd</b> | solve this nightmare will have our full support. But when you say a

<b>Floyd</b> | disagreements, but we're all family here! Even the servants! Are you
<b>Floyd</b> | saying that we'd kill our own?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "What I am saying is that I've investigated the house and the grounds,
<b>Floyd</b> | I've examined the body, and I've determined that no stranger has
<b>Floyd</b> | visited within the past forty-eight hours. Your brother died between

<b>Floyd</b> | receding. Every tendon in his body is taut with energy and his eyes
<b>Floyd</b> | flash with an intelligence that he alone can estimate. He is not
<b>Floyd</b> | wearing his cap today and his lapels are dusted with ash.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You need not trust each other," Holmes replies. "Only trust me, and
<b>Floyd</b> | trust me when I tell you that my dog has a nose second to none other.
<b>Floyd</b> | I've already gathered enough evidence to form a strong hypothesis. Now
<b>Floyd</b> | Toby here will make the final test."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "How'll he manage that?" inquires the gardener. "Can he sniff out guilt
<b>Floyd</b> | or has he got a scent to find? You can only rely on an animal's
<b>Floyd</b> | insticts so much, detective."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I could not agree with you more, especially considering that we humans
<b>Floyd</b> | are animals too. But never fear. Toby will have a solid lead to track."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With that, Holmes unfurls a ribbon, dangling it aloft for everyone to
<b>Floyd</b> | see.

<b>Floyd</b> | you'll note, it has seen better times. The fabric is bloody and torn.
<b>Floyd</b> | Once Toby has a whiff, its scent should take him straight to the
<b>Floyd</b> | culprit."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Holmes lowers the ribbon to your level, all eyes following.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Now remember, Toby," he tells you, "once you've decided on your man --

<b>Floyd</b> | "What's this?" he had said, stooping to examine an otherwise

<b>Floyd</b> | "It's only a ribbon," said Watson. "Someone must have dropped it, or
