The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.  You can see the full list of ClubFloyd transcripts by clicking <A HREF="file:///F:/Jacqueline/My%20Documents/My%20Websites/AllThingsJacq/interactive_fiction.html#clubfloyd"><U>here</U></A>.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Lord Bellwater's Secret</i> by Sam Gordon.  <i>Lord Bellwater's Secret</i> was originally released as part of the 2007 IF Competition, where it took third place.

<b>Floyd</b> | As an aspiring groom in Lord Bellwater's household, recklessness has
<b>Floyd</b> | not been one of the qualities for which you, Bert Smith, would wish to
<b>Floyd</b> | be noted. However, desperate times call for desperate measures, and
<b>Floyd</b> | here you are in the early hours of the morning of Saturday 20th June
<b>Floyd</b> | 1863, undertaking the most reckless venture of your life. Instead of

<b>Floyd</b> | retiring to your bed, in your lodgings in the mews at the back of Lord
<b>Floyd</b> | Bellwater's town house, you sneaked into the house and hid in the
<b>Floyd</b> | cellar until the household had gone to bed. You sidled into the
<b>Floyd</b> | butler's pantry and took the key to the master's study and now find
<b>Floyd</b> | yourself creeping about like a common thief. You hear the clock in the
<b>Floyd</b> | hall strike one o'clock as you carefully pull the study door closed

<b>Floyd</b> | behind you.

<b>Floyd</b> | 6/11N)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lord Bellwater's study
<b>Floyd</b> | The study is a well-proportioned, rectangular room. The door, of finely
<b>Floyd</b> | polished oak, leads back onto the landing, to the west; a broad sash

<b>Floyd</b> | window in the opposite wall looks out over Cadogan Square. The heavy
<b>Floyd</b> | velvet curtains are drawn back and a pale moonlight falls into the
<b>Floyd</b> | room, illuminating a heavy mahogany desk in its centre. To the right of
<b>Floyd</b> | the window is a small table.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the north side of the room is a stone fireplace with a dull red glow

<b>Floyd</b> | still coming from the remains of the coals, burning among the ashes: a
<b>Floyd</b> | shadowy oil painting hangs above it. To the left of the fireplace is a
<b>Floyd</b> | wooden stand, supporting an ornate porcelain pot, in which a leafy
<b>Floyd</b> | plant is growing. The south wall is covered, floor to ceiling, with
<b>Floyd</b> | bookshelves, laden with hundreds, if not thousands, of leather-bound
<b>Floyd</b> | volumes, in neat rows.

<b>Floyd</b> | had seen her briefly on the morning of her death. She had been shaking

<b>Floyd</b> |           Acme patented wall safe. Instructions for use.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The safe will have been set up with a code consisting of three numbers
<b>Floyd</b> | (each between 1 and 100). These numbers should NEVER be written down
<b>Floyd</b> | but must be committed to memory. When the safe is first installed, it

<b>Floyd</b> | is advisable to select three numbers that are easily memorable. For
<b>Floyd</b> | instance, they might be selected for a memorable date. Someone who
<b>Floyd</b> | remembers the Battle of Waterloo (which took place on 18th June 1815)
<b>Floyd</b> | might choose the numbers 15, 6, 18, which are the year, month and day
<b>Floyd</b> | of the battle.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | To open the safe, proceed as follows:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  1. Spin the dial so that the mechanism is reset.
<b>Floyd</b> |  2. Turn the dial to the first number (eg 15)
<b>Floyd</b> |  3. Turn the dial to the second number (eg 6)
<b>Floyd</b> |  4. Turn the dial to the third number (eg 18)

<b>Floyd</b> |  5. Turn the handle
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The door will now open.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After closing the door, spin the dial once again to ensure that the

<b>Floyd</b> |              Judge's ruling in the Court of Chancery

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Readers of this newspaper will be aware of the recent case in the Court
<b>Floyd</b> | of Chancery, regarding the last will and testament of Sir Archibald
<b>Floyd</b> | Ramswell of Dorchester. We reported yesterday that Sir Archibald's will
<b>Floyd</b> | (in which he divided his entire estate between his housekeeper and his
<b>Floyd</b> | favourite horse) was being contested by his eldest son, the Honourable

<b>Floyd</b> | Percy Ramswell, who was not mentioned in the will.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After due consideration, the judge (Mr Justice Williams) has now
<b>Floyd</b> | delivered his judgement. In summary, he has stated that under English
<b>Floyd</b> | law, a man may leave his property to any living person and is certainly
<b>Floyd</b> | under no obligation to leave anything to his children if he does not

<b>Floyd</b> | wish to do so. However, a horse is not a living person and is
<b>Floyd</b> | ineligible to be a beneficiary of a will. His ruling is therefore that
<b>Floyd</b> | in this case, the entire estate is to be given to the only living
<b>Floyd</b> | person mentioned in the will, namely the housekeeper. The judge
<b>Floyd</b> | informed the housekeeper that she is entitled to use her newly-acquired
<b>Floyd</b> | fortune as she wishes, but that she might see fit to make arrangements

<b>Floyd</b> | for the comfort of the horse. This comment caused a ripple of mirth in
<b>Floyd</b> | the courtroom, shared by all except The Honourable Percy Ramswell.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On a separate legal point which had been raised on behalf of Sir
<b>Floyd</b> | Archibald's son, the judge ruled that the naming of a horse in one's
<b>Floyd</b> | will was not, in itself, evidence of insaninty, and that the terms of

<b>Floyd</b> | the will could not be contested on those grounds. "If everyone who
<b>Floyd</b> | preferred their horse to their son was to be certified insane,"
<b>Floyd</b> | declared Judge Williams, "There should not be asylums enough to house
<b>Floyd</b> | them all."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The article has been ringed with green ink and a handwritten note in

<b>Floyd</b> | the margin reads "Capital idea. Maybe leave everything to a horse
<b>Floyd</b> | rather than to James!"

<b>Floyd</b> | An Interactive Fiction by Sam Gordon

<b>Floyd</b> | 6/11N)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lord Bellwater's study
<b>Floyd</b> | The study is a well-proportioned, rectangular room. The door, of finely

<b>Floyd</b> | polished oak, leads back onto the landing, to the west; a broad sash
<b>Floyd</b> | window in the opposite wall looks out over Cadogan Square. The heavy
<b>Floyd</b> | velvet curtains are drawn back and a pale moonlight falls into the
<b>Floyd</b> | room, illuminating a heavy mahogany desk in its centre. To the right of
<b>Floyd</b> | the window is a small table.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | On the north side of the room is a stone fireplace with a dull red glow
<b>Floyd</b> | still coming from the remains of the coals, burning among the ashes: a
<b>Floyd</b> | shadowy oil painting hangs above it. To the left of the fireplace is a
<b>Floyd</b> | wooden stand, supporting an ornate porcelain pot, in which a leafy
<b>Floyd</b> | plant is growing. The south wall is covered, floor to ceiling, with
<b>Floyd</b> | bookshelves, laden with hundreds, if not thousands, of leather-bound

<b>Floyd</b> | volumes, in neat rows.

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | As we discussed, he asked me to draw up a new (and rather surprising)
<b>Floyd</b> | will, shortly before his sad decease. As I indicated to you, the will
<b>Floyd</b> | was properly drawn up by myself, was signed by your father and was

<b>Floyd</b> | your possession, as you explained to me) and the other retained by me

<b>Floyd</b> | as an office copy. This new will revoked your father's previous will,
<b>Floyd</b> | made some years ago, in which he had left everything to yourself.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You have made a strong case to me that your father was losing his mind
<b>Floyd</b> | towards the end of his final illness and that this new will was
<b>Floyd</b> | therefore invalid. I have to say that I saw no sign of your father's

<b>Floyd</b> | loss of mental powers when I was with him, but I accept that you have
<b>Floyd</b> | been a good deal closer to him than me and that you are better placed
<b>Floyd</b> | to make that judgement. I also accept that some of the wording of the
<b>Floyd</b> | will could be taken to indicate an unbalanced mind. I fully understand
<b>Floyd</b> | your reluctance to challenge the will through the legal process, which
<b>Floyd</b> | would require giving evidence in court of your father's worsening

<b>Floyd</b> | mental state. I appreciate that you do not wish to dishonour his memory
<b>Floyd</b> | by dragging these details through the courts.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In view of all the above considerations I have decided to accept your
<b>Floyd</b> | account of your father's dementure and that it will be for the best for
<b>Floyd</b> | us to destroy all copies of the recent will and to abide by the terms

<b>Floyd</b> | of the earlier will. I therefore enclose the office copy of the recent
<b>Floyd</b> | will and leave it for you to dispose of it as you see fit. I have no
<b>Floyd</b> | further record of the will and will treat its existence as a matter of
<b>Floyd</b> | client confidentiality between the two of us.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You also mentioned to me that you have some sort of hold over the

<b>Floyd</b> | butler which will guarantee his absolute silence and loyalty. However,
<b>Floyd</b> | I am more concerned about the an unhappy "accident", which occurred to
<b>Floyd</b> | the chambermaid, who was the other witness to the will. You indicated
<b>Floyd</b> | that her fortuitous death was not quite so accidental as you would like
<b>Floyd</b> | people to believe. I cannot help but draw the conclusion that you had
<b>Floyd</b> | some part in her death. Whilst I would find such behaviour personally

<b>Floyd</b> | unacceptable, I shall, of course, be bound by my professional
<b>Floyd</b> | confidentiality in my dealings with you as a client.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On a separate matter, you kindly mentioned in our conversation that I
<b>Floyd</b> | have performed a great many services for your family over the years,
<b>Floyd</b> | often without any direct remuneration from your father and that you

<b>Floyd</b> | intended to pay me a modest sum in recompense for these services. I
<b>Floyd</b> | think you mentioned a sum in the region of 5000 pounds, which I
<b>Floyd</b> | consider to be most generous and look forward to receiving.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Yours sincerely
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Roger Jowett
<b>Floyd</b> | Your solicitor and loyal friend.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Although this letter makes mention of an enclosed copy of a will, there
<b>Floyd</b> | is nothing of that sort attached to the letter.

<b>Floyd</b> | Thank you for your letter and your acceptance of our arrangement. I
<b>Floyd</b> | have decided not to destroy the two copies immediately but I have put

<b>Floyd</b> | them where they cannot be found. I have also placed your letter in an
<b>Floyd</b> | extremely safe place. That, too, I am keeping, just in case you should

<b>Floyd</b> | is honest and reasonable but, if you should suddenly decide to view it
<b>Floyd</b> | otherwise, the letter would make your part very plain. Once the
<b>Floyd</b> | formalities have been completed for my inheritance and assuming that

<b>Floyd</b> | goes unchallenged, I shall destroy both the letter and the copies of
<b>Floyd</b> | the will.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Regarding my part in the death of the servant, I have to inform you
<b>Floyd</b> | that you are much mistaken. A rogue and a cad I may be, but a murderer
<b>Floyd</b> | I am not. Indeed I fear I may have given you too much of my favourite

<b>Floyd</b> | brandy on Monday evening, leaving you not quite in command of your
<b>Floyd</b> | senses. In case you doubt my veracity, the exact situation is that I
<b>Floyd</b> | entered my study to see Dewhurst, my butler trying to force his
<b>Floyd</b> | attentions on the girl. He had his back to me and didn't see me enter
<b>Floyd</b> | the room. The girl was struggling to get away from him and he seemed to
<b>Floyd</b> | lose his temper and giver her an almightly shove. She fell back against

<b>Floyd</b> | the open window and toppled over the sill.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I was very consoling to poor Dewhurst and agreed that I would not call
<b>Floyd</b> | in the police, so long as he signed a confession, on the undertanding
<b>Floyd</b> | that if I am completely satisfied with his service for the next five
<b>Floyd</b> | years, I shall destroy the confession.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With regard to the other matter that you mention, as soon as I have
<b>Floyd</b> | received the benefit of my inheritance, I shall be in a position to pay
<b>Floyd</b> | you for the past services that we discussed. The sum you mentioned
<b>Floyd</b> | would indeed be generous but I think I can offer something approaching
<b>Floyd</b> | that amount.

<b>Floyd</b> | I, Robert William Dewhurst do make this sworn statement to Lord James
<b>Floyd</b> | Bellwater. On 15th June 1863, I came into my Lord's private study,
<b>Floyd</b> | where I found Elsie Browning, a female servant, polishing the windows.
<b>Floyd</b> | I have long held an affection for this girl and I tried to press my
<b>Floyd</b> | attentions on her. She struggled in my arms and I thought she was
<b>Floyd</b> | teasing me and I was all the more keen to embrace her. However, she

<b>Floyd</b> | then proceeded to slap my face, at which point I lost my temper and
<b>Floyd</b> | pushed her away from me. I did not know my own strength and she fell
<b>Floyd</b> | back, against the open window with such force that she lost her balance
<b>Floyd</b> | and fell out. I was filled with remorse and ran downstairs and out of

<b>Floyd</b> | Some weeks later, the following item appears in "The Times":
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Today at the Old Bailey was concluded the trial which has been called
<b>Floyd</b> | (in the more "popular" press) the "Bellwater burglary case". The
<b>Floyd</b> | curious background to this case is that in the early hours of 20th June
<b>Floyd</b> | a groom, then in the service of Lord James Bellwater, was discovered in
<b>Floyd</b> | his employer's study, in the act of stealing papers and a substantial
<b>Floyd</b> | sum of money from a safe.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | During the ensuing trial, the groom, by the name of Smith, has made
<b>Floyd</b> | repeated allegations that a murder had been committed in Lord
<b>Floyd</b> | Bellwater's household and that his employer was trying to subvert the
<b>Floyd</b> | intentions of his late father's will.  The trial of Smith has created a
<b>Floyd</b> | degree of public interest because Lord Bellwater himself appeared as a

<b>Floyd</b> | witness for the prosecution: despite his many business comittments and
<b>Floyd</b> | his recent bereavement (the previous Lord Bellwater having passed away
<b>Floyd</b> | a few days before the events of the case), Lord Bellwater stated that
<b>Floyd</b> | he must "do his public duty as a witness and ensure that justice is
<b>Floyd</b> | done".
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | After retiring for just fifteen minutes, the jury returned a guilty
<b>Floyd</b> | verdict on Smith. In sentencing, the Judge spoke out strongly against
<b>Floyd</b> | this servant who has breached the trust of the noble family of
<b>Floyd</b> | Bellwater. Smith is to be transported, for life, to the penal colony in
<b>Floyd</b> | Western Australia.

<b>Floyd</b> | in some surprise, but then they spot you silhouetted against the light

<b>Floyd</b> | Some weeks later, the following item appears in "The Times":
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Today at the Old Bailey was concluded the trial which has been called
<b>Floyd</b> | (in the more "popular" press) the "Bellwater burglary case". The
<b>Floyd</b> | curious background to this case is that in the early hours of 20th June
<b>Floyd</b> | a groom, then in the service of Lord James Bellwater, was discovered in

<b>Floyd</b> | his employer's study, in the act of stealing papers and a substantial
<b>Floyd</b> | sum of money from a safe.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | During the ensuing trial, the groom, by the name of Smith, has made
<b>Floyd</b> | repeated allegations that a murder had been committed in Lord
<b>Floyd</b> | Bellwater's household and that his employer was trying to subvert the

<b>Floyd</b> | intentions of his late father's will.  The trial of Smith has created a
<b>Floyd</b> | degree of public interest because Lord Bellwater himself appeared as a
<b>Floyd</b> | witness for the prosecution: despite his many business comittments and
<b>Floyd</b> | his recent bereavement (the previous Lord Bellwater having passed away
<b>Floyd</b> | a few days before the events of the case), Lord Bellwater stated that
<b>Floyd</b> | he must "do his public duty as a witness and ensure that justice is

<b>Floyd</b> | done".
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After retiring for just fifteen minutes, the jury returned a guilty
<b>Floyd</b> | verdict on Smith. In sentencing, the Judge spoke out strongly against
<b>Floyd</b> | this servant who has breached the trust of the noble family of
<b>Floyd</b> | Bellwater. Smith is to be transported, for life, to the penal colony in

<b>Floyd</b> | Western Australia.

<b>Floyd</b> | Some weeks later, the following item appears in "The Times":

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Today at the Old Bailey was concluded the trial which has been called
<b>Floyd</b> | (in the more "popular" press) the "Bellwater murder case". Mr George
<b>Floyd</b> | Dewhurst, a butler in the household of Lord Bellwater was charged with
<b>Floyd</b> | the unlawful killing of a house servant, Elsie Browning. The main
<b>Floyd</b> | evidence against Dewhurst was provided by a groom in Lord Bellwater's

<b>Floyd</b> | household, named Bert Smith, who presented himself at Scotland Yard, in
<b>Floyd</b> | the early hours of a day in June this year, with several documents
<b>Floyd</b> | which pointed to Dewhurst's having committed the crime.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After retiring for a short time, the jury found Dewhurst guilty of
<b>Floyd</b> | manslaughter and the judge sentenced him  to be transported, for life,

<b>Floyd</b> | to the penal colony in Western Australia.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The case has raised considerable public attention, not only because the
<b>Floyd</b> | crime took place in the household of a noble lord, but also because of
<b>Floyd</b> | some of the surprising allegations (not directly related to the case)
<b>Floyd</b> | that have been made by the groom, Bert Smith. In particular, Smith has

<b>Floyd</b> | claimed that he is himself the lawful beneficiary of the will of the
<b>Floyd</b> | late Lord Horace Bellwater - a claim ridiculed by the present Lord
<b>Floyd</b> | Bellwater and effectively silenced by a sworn affidavit by the
<b>Floyd</b> | Bellwaters' family solicitor, Roger Jowett Esq, who has declared the
<b>Floyd</b> | supposed will to be a forgery.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | We understand that one of the "popular" newspapers, the "Daily News"
<b>Floyd</b> | has championed the cause of Bert Smith, and during the course of the
<b>Floyd</b> | trial, it has been raising a public subscription, amongst its
<b>Floyd</b> | readership, for the benefit of Smith. A considerable sum has been
<b>Floyd</b> | raised, providing Smith with the capital to start his own business,
<b>Floyd</b> | running a livery stable.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In an extraordinary gesture of generosity, and as a personal
<b>Floyd</b> | contribution to this new business venture, it is understood that Lord
<b>Floyd</b> | James Bellwater has presented Smith with the late Lord Bellwater's
<b>Floyd</b> | horse.

<b>Floyd</b> | Purdy and Jowett (Solicitors)
<b>Floyd</b> | 3 Holborn Court

<b>Floyd</b> | London WC
<b>Floyd</b> | 16th June 1863
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Personal and in confidence
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Dear James

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We talked last night over a few brandies at your club about your
<b>Floyd</b> | father's last will and testament.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As we discussed, he asked me to draw up a new (and rather surprising)
<b>Floyd</b> | will, shortly before his sad decease. As I indicated to you, the will

<b>Floyd</b> | was properly drawn up by myself, was signed by your father and was
<b>Floyd</b> | witnessed by his butler and one of his chambermaids. There were two
<b>Floyd</b> | copies, one of which was kept by your father (and therefore came into
<b>Floyd</b> | your possession, as you explained to me) and the other retained by me
<b>Floyd</b> | as an office copy. This new will revoked your father's previous will,
<b>Floyd</b> | made some years ago, in which he had left everything to yourself.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You have made a strong case to me that your father was losing his mind
<b>Floyd</b> | towards the end of his final illness and that this new will was
<b>Floyd</b> | therefore invalid. I have to say that I saw no sign of your father's
<b>Floyd</b> | loss of mental powers when I was with him, but I accept that you have
<b>Floyd</b> | been a good deal closer to him than me and that you are better placed

<b>Floyd</b> | to make that judgement. I also accept that some of the wording of the
<b>Floyd</b> | will could be taken to indicate an unbalanced mind. I fully understand
<b>Floyd</b> | your reluctance to challenge the will through the legal process, which
<b>Floyd</b> | would require giving evidence in court of your father's worsening
<b>Floyd</b> | mental state. I appreciate that you do not wish to dishonour his memory
<b>Floyd</b> | by dragging these details through the courts.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In view of all the above considerations I have decided to accept your
<b>Floyd</b> | account of your father's dementure and that it will be for the best for
<b>Floyd</b> | us to destroy all copies of the recent will and to abide by the terms
<b>Floyd</b> | of the earlier will. I therefore enclose the office copy of the recent
<b>Floyd</b> | will and leave it for you to dispose of it as you see fit. I have no

<b>Floyd</b> | further record of the will and will treat its existence as a matter of
<b>Floyd</b> | client confidentiality between the two of us.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You also mentioned to me that you have some sort of hold over the
<b>Floyd</b> | butler which will guarantee his absolute silence and loyalty. However,
<b>Floyd</b> | I am more concerned about the an unhappy "accident", which occurred to

<b>Floyd</b> | the chambermaid, who was the other witness to the will. You indicated
<b>Floyd</b> | that her fortuitous death was not quite so accidental as you would like
<b>Floyd</b> | people to believe. I cannot help but draw the conclusion that you had
<b>Floyd</b> | some part in her death. Whilst I would find such behaviour personally
<b>Floyd</b> | unacceptable, I shall, of course, be bound by my professional
<b>Floyd</b> | confidentiality in my dealings with you as a client.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On a separate matter, you kindly mentioned in our conversation that I
<b>Floyd</b> | have performed a great many services for your family over the years,
<b>Floyd</b> | often without any direct remuneration from your father and that you
<b>Floyd</b> | intended to pay me a modest sum in recompense for these services. I
<b>Floyd</b> | think you mentioned a sum in the region of 5000 pounds, which I

<b>Floyd</b> | consider to be most generous and look forward to receiving.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Yours sincerely
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Roger Jowett
<b>Floyd</b> | Your solicitor and loyal friend.

<b>Floyd</b> | Although this letter makes mention of an enclosed copy of a will, there

<b>Floyd</b> | be noted. However, desperate times call for desperate measures, and
<b>Floyd</b> | here you are in the early hours of the morning of Saturday 20th June
<b>Floyd</b> | 1863, undertaking the most reckless venture of your life. Instead of
<b>Floyd</b> | retiring to your bed, in your lodgings in the mews at the back of Lord

<b>Floyd</b> | Bellwater's town house, you sneaked into the house and hid in the
<b>Floyd</b> | cellar until the household had gone to bed. You sidled into the
<b>Floyd</b> | butler's pantry and took the key to the master's study and now find
<b>Floyd</b> | yourself creeping about like a common thief. You hear the clock in the
<b>Floyd</b> | hall strike one o'clock as you carefully pull the study door closed
<b>Floyd</b> | behind you.

<b>Floyd</b> | Lord Bellwater's study
<b>Floyd</b> | The study is a well-proportioned, rectangular room. The door, of finely
<b>Floyd</b> | polished oak, leads back onto the landing, to the west; a broad sash
<b>Floyd</b> | window in the opposite wall looks out over Cadogan Square. The heavy
<b>Floyd</b> | velvet curtains are drawn back and a pale moonlight falls into the
<b>Floyd</b> | room, illuminating a heavy mahogany desk in its centre. To the right of

<b>Floyd</b> | the window is a small table.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the north side of the room is a stone fireplace with a dull red glow
<b>Floyd</b> | still coming from the remains of the coals, burning among the ashes: a
<b>Floyd</b> | shadowy oil painting hangs above it. To the left of the fireplace is a
<b>Floyd</b> | wooden stand, supporting an ornate porcelain pot, in which a leafy

<b>Floyd</b> | plant is growing. The south wall is covered, floor to ceiling, with
<b>Floyd</b> | bookshelves, laden with hundreds, if not thousands, of leather-bound
<b>Floyd</b> | volumes, in neat rows.
