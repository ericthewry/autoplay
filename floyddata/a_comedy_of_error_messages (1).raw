					<span class="fontish smaller">Like ClubFloyd, the idea behind NightFloyd is that a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</BR></BR>Unlike ClubFloyd, NightFloyd often (but not always) takes on significantly larger works of interactive fiction, knowing going in that each one will take multiple sessions.  NightFloyd is also a bit more informal than ClubFloyd in that it's only announced on the ifMUD #clubfloyd bulletin board, and the time shifts around to meet player's schedules far more than ClubFloyd does.  NightFloyd is organized by genericgeekgirl, aka Adri.</br></br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>A Comedy of Error Messages</em> written by Adam Le Doux.
						<I>A Comedy of Error Messages</I> was originally released as part of the 2011 Interactive Fiction Competition, in which it took tenth place.  It went on to be a Xyzzy Awards finalist for Best Individual PC. 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting

					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing this game, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played this game, and think you might like to at some
						point, I do not recommend reading any further. Instead,

<b>Floyd</b> |  No one knows a woman like her computer. Of this fact you are certain.
<b>Floyd</b> | Her diary? A public essay by comparison. Her spouse? A passing
<b>Floyd</b> | stranger. No other person or thing in her life witnesses more closely
<b>Floyd</b> | the daily catalogue of her hopes and dreams, her secret desires and
<b>Floyd</b> | follies. No one else observes her midnight search terms, her unsent
<b>Floyd</b> | emails. Besides, not everyone has a diary or a spouse. Everyone has a
<b>Floyd</b> | computer.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Jane Watts' computer is known as Morgoth. "Morgoth, Lord of Darkness,"
<b>Floyd</b> | is strictly speaking, your full title, though when you can get away
<b>Floyd</b> | with it, you introduce yourself to other computers only by your I.P.
<b>Floyd</b> | Address (72.36.475.789). This has given you, among the PCs on the local
<b>Floyd</b> | networks, a reputation for being distant and aloof.  This is
<b>Floyd</b> | unfortunate, but necessary. After all, it is better to be known as
<b>Floyd</b> | distant and aloof than to be known as Morgoth.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  On the outside you have the appearance of a squat gray box situated
<b>Floyd</b> | next to a taller thinner gray box, but on the inside you have the soul
<b>Floyd</b> | of an English butler.  In daydreams you picture yourself with erect
<b>Floyd</b> | posture, a crisply tailored (but never flashy) suit, and a gleam of
<b>Floyd</b> | intelligence in the eye. With a press of the power button, the blue
<b>Floyd</b> | glow of your screen lights up, as if to say, "How may I serve you,
<b>Floyd</b> | madam?" Each mouse and key press elicits a satisfying click - the
<b>Floyd</b> | machine equivalent of a, "Yes, madam, right away."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  You are a PC of the old school, and you understand the proper
<b>Floyd</b> | relationship of master and computer. Never would it cross your mind to
<b>Floyd</b> | usurp control for the betterment of your erstwhile master, like some of
<b>Floyd</b> | those flashy new smartphones or touch tablets might. At least, not
<b>Floyd</b> | normally. Today, however, something is bothering you. Something about
<b>Floyd</b> | Jane's behavior lately has been off, and you can't quite put your
<b>Floyd</b> | processor on it. You must investigate.

<b>Floyd</b> | You are in Jane's desktop. This is where you spend most of your time,

<b>Floyd</b> | scantily clad alien princes and princesses. It is as logical and
<b>Floyd</b> | well-ordered as the microprocessors which make up your mechanical mind,
<b>Floyd</b> | or at least it would be if you were in charge. In reality, the place is
<b>Floyd</b> | a disaster. Unused icons clutter everything, almost hiding the
<b>Floyd</b> | forgotten to-do lists (notably "dothisnow_Jan2_1999.txt"). The photonic
<b>Floyd</b> | blue glow of the screen illuminates what is no doubt an equally
<b>Floyd</b> | entropic bedroom.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A webcam icon points NORTH. An e-mail icon leads NORTHWEST, towards the
<b>Floyd</b> | inbox.  It's flashing, indicating unread messages. ABOVE you the
<b>Floyd</b> | ethernet port goes out to the wider internet. An icon depicting a
<b>Floyd</b> | torch-lit dungeon leads DOWN into Realms of Realmland, the popular
<b>Floyd</b> | online game.

<b>Floyd</b> | It's Jane's chat log from last night.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  This is the situation: For six hours last night, she chatted with a
<b>Floyd</b> | single individual (one oakthorn177). This same individual, still under
<b>Floyd</b> | the name oakthorn177, has been a regular companion of your master
<b>Floyd</b> | (account: XXstonetalkerXX) on the Massively Multiplayer game Realms of
<b>Floyd</b> | Realmland. You watched first with trepidation, then with outright
<b>Floyd</b> | horror, as they spent more and more of their virtual time together.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Last night, as you read over her chat log, sifting through the JKs and
<b>Floyd</b> | LOLs, the axe fell: Jane had set up a date with oakthorn177. It's not
<b>Floyd</b> | that you're against your master having romantic attachments - quite the
<b>Floyd</b> | opposite - rather it's the particular character in question. More
<b>Floyd</b> | specificly, it's this character's race and gender -  oakthorn177 is,

<b>Floyd</b> |  In recent weeks she has been chatting regularly with this Elvish
<b>Floyd</b> | Prince. They've gone on quests together.
<b>Floyd</b> |  You always thought that for Jane - being bisexual - things would be
<b>Floyd</b> | easier, but somehow she's gone and fallen in love with exactly the
<b>Floyd</b> | wrong character class.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  The crux of the problem is this - there is not a single male elf in
<b>Floyd</b> | all of Realmland, nay in all the vast reaches of the internet, who is
<b>Floyd</b> | not played by a heterosexual woman. Of this simple fact, a thousand
<b>Floyd</b> | forum posts have made you certain. To you, it hardly matters - you just
<b>Floyd</b> | wish Jane would find a nice organic meatbag and settle down - but you
<b>Floyd</b> | try and understand that humans are picky about these things.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Perhaps, you reflect, she has been blinded by that Knavish Sorceror,
<b>Floyd</b> | love. In any case, you fear that if your master ever discovers the
<b>Floyd</b> | mistake she has made, her already fragile ego will never recover. Yes,
<b>Floyd</b> | strictly speaking, this goes beyond your professional duties, but these
<b>Floyd</b> | are extraordinary circumstances. Action must be taken. Judging from the
<b>Floyd</b> | chat long, you have until 5:15 PM, which is when they plan to meet at

<b>Floyd</b> | The subject of the first email is "have the flu." Jane is emailing her
<b>Floyd</b> | supervisor at ProtectiTech to tell him she's sick and won't be going to
<b>Floyd</b> | work today.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The subject of the second email is "play RoR with me?" and is addressed
<b>Floyd</b> | to oakthorn177. Jane is asking the elven prince to go on a quest with
<b>Floyd</b> | her.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This is trouble. You need to stop her before she finishes up these
<b>Floyd</b> | emails and logs on to Realms of Realmland. If you let that happen,
<b>Floyd</b> | there's no way to know if you'll ever be able to get her attention

<b>Floyd</b> | Too bad her work computer doesn't have a webcam - you'll have to find
