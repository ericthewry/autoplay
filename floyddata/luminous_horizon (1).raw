The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Luminous Horizon</i>, written by Paul&nbsp;O'Brian.  <i>Luminous Horizon</i> was originally released as part of the 2004 IF Competition, where it took first place.  It also received Xyzzy nominations for Best NPCs and Best Individual PC.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Luminous_Horizon"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

</br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | There is heat. There is glaring light outside your closed eyes. You

<b>Floyd</b> | are aware of uneven, rocky ground beneath you, its prickles and points
<b>Floyd</b> | muffled by the thick earthsuit that covers your body. You slowly sit
<b>Floyd</b> | up, opening your eyes to an arid landscape of rocks and scrub. How did
<b>Floyd</b> | you get here?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then the memories erupt. Your parents' disappearance a month ago. Your

<b>Floyd</b> | discovery of their creations, suits that give you and your sister
<b>Floyd</b> | Emily fantastic superpowers. Using those powers to save your campus
<b>Floyd</b> | when longtime family friend Nina Icolari turned into a raging
<b>Floyd</b> | behemoth, transformed by a prehistoric bacteria sample gone amok. When
<b>Floyd</b> | Aunt Nina recovered, she also recovered memories that had been
<b>Floyd</b> | suppressed by mysterious interlopers, memories that led you and Emily

<b>Floyd</b> | to Professor Thaddeus Andrews' remote observation post in the Sierra
<b>Floyd</b> | Nevadas. There, you found an astonishing teleportation device,
<b>Floyd</b> | apparently built by your parents. The device took you to another world
<b>Floyd</b> | entirely, an artificially constructed planetoid built solely for the
<b>Floyd</b> | purpose of testing hyper-evolutionary bacteria, perhaps related to the
<b>Floyd</b> | microbes that affected Aunt Nina.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Emily was transported to the other side of the planetoid's outer
<b>Floyd</b> | structure, where you found the alien scientist in charge of the
<b>Floyd</b> | experiment. That scientist explained to the two of you that his rival
<b>Floyd</b> | Esrrua had stowed a spy-creature aboard the experiment, and that
<b>Floyd</b> | Andrews had tried to intervene in the ensuing fight, only to be

<b>Floyd</b> | captured by Esrrua himself. Your parents had followed to rescue
<b>Floyd</b> | Andrews, pursuing the spy-creature through another teleportation
<b>Floyd</b> | portal... the same one that brought you here. But although Emily is
<b>Floyd</b> | beside you, struggling to her feet and no doubt reliving her own
<b>Floyd</b> | memories, your parents are nowhere to be seen. In fact, besides the
<b>Floyd</b> | bushes and the distant mountains, the area is quite featureless.

<b>Floyd</b> | Entry Corridor
<b>Floyd</b> | The entry corridor of the fortress looks innocent enough, just a
<b>Floyd</b> | simple passageway leading north, with some mangled iron doors at the

<b>Floyd</b> | south end. At the moment, though, what with the rampaging horde of
<b>Floyd</b> | security robots, maybe it doesn't seem so innocent after all. Down the

<b>Floyd</b> | synchronization.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An alarm panel adorns the wall here, its lights flashing in perfect

<b>Floyd</b> | synchronization with the sounds of the alarm despite a few dents from
<b>Floyd</b> | Austin's fists.

<b>Floyd</b> | Esrrua's Lab

<b>Floyd</b> | Even though this room is filled with clutter and equipment, it still
<b>Floyd</b> | has about as much open floor space as half a basketball court. A large
<b>Floyd</b> | window occupies much of its west wall, through which you can see
<b>Floyd</b> | another room, where one of the cat-aliens stands before a broad
<b>Floyd</b> | control panel. Byzantine machinery dominates all the other walls, and
<b>Floyd</b> | at the far north end of both rooms, a teleportation curtain shimmers

<b>Floyd</b> | and pulsates. Just behind you, to the south, the unbreakable polymer
<b>Floyd</b> | sheet once again blocks the exit. A monitor window floats in the air,
<b>Floyd</b> | displaying a view of the dilapidated road that winds just west of this
<b>Floyd</b> | fortress. Several clear chambers, one of which is filled with a
<b>Floyd</b> | swirling green cloud, reach to the ceiling.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Austin stands next to you, his eyes taking in everything.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the center of the room stands another of the cat-aliens: a humanoid
<b>Floyd</b> | figure, well over seven feet tall and heavily muscled. It whirls to
<b>Floyd</b> | face you, and its oval-slitted eyes glare savagely. The creature bares
<b>Floyd</b> | its teeth, flattens its ears, and drops into a crouch. This can be

<b>Floyd</b> | none other than Esrrua.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | By Esrrua's side, a white, amorphous mass trembles, sending out eager
<b>Floyd</b> | pseudopods in your direction. The thing is large, as tall as Esrrua
<b>Floyd</b> | and half again as wide, but it is shapeless, constantly rippling its
<b>Floyd</b> | boundaries like a gigantic, puffy amoeba.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "SO!" shouts Esrrua imperiously. "Still more apelings come to plague
<b>Floyd</b> | the progress of science! But you are too late! TOO LATE!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He turns toward the window and points at the control panel. "Maerr,
<b>Floyd</b> | release the bacteria!"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Turning back to you, he curls his lip. "I will not taint my paws with
<b>Floyd</b> | your stink, dirty apelings, when my niarr can destroy you instead!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "DEVOUR THEM!" he shouts, and the white blob surges forward, long

<b>Floyd</b> | The fortress is disintegrating all around you, but the ceiling here is
<b>Floyd</b> | open, and the pipe-covered vehicle hovers about eight feet off the
<b>Floyd</b> | ground. The vehicle's floor is transparent, and through it you can see
<b>Floyd</b> | Mom and Dad, along with an older man who must be Thaddeus Andrews,
<b>Floyd</b> | urging you to enter via a large hatch. A quick jump and you're in,
<b>Floyd</b> | with Emily swooping right behind you. The hatch closes, Dad

<b>Floyd</b> | manipulates an alien device, and the vehicle rises higher. Through its
<b>Floyd</b> | floor, you can see the last of the fortress consume itself into
<b>Floyd</b> | nonexistence, with only a sinkhole in the desert to suggest anything
<b>Floyd</b> | of Earth's first contact with an extraterrestrial species.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Austin!" says Emily, grabbing your arm, "We did it! We found Mom and

<b>Floyd</b> | Dad, and basically saved the world in the process! The freaking world,
<b>Floyd</b> | Austin! We are superheroes! We are a family of superheroes, and my
<b>Floyd</b> | GOD, we rock!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Yeah. Saved the world. You did, didn't you?
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Life is going to be a whole lot different now. That's the thought that
<b>Floyd</b> | keeps going through your head as you sail westward, in an alien
<b>Floyd</b> | vehicle, with your super-powered family, into the luminous horizon.
