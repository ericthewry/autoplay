The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Plundered Hearts</i>, written by Amy Briggs.  <I>Plundered Hearts</I> was released in 1987 by Infocom.  You can learn more about the game by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Plundered_Hearts'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.  The game is only available commercially, and given its age it can sometimes be quite difficult to track down, but it's well worth the investment of time and money to find your own copy, because it's a true classic.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | Deck
<b>Floyd</b> |    The deck is an avalanche of noise and blood. Lit by roaring fires,
<b>Floyd</b> | silhouetted forms crash swords, dancing around the screaming wounded.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Out of the smoke staggers Davis, tugging a bloodied knife from the
<b>Floyd</b> | back of a pirate. Davis's eyes gleam white from a face blackened and
<b>Floyd</b> | bloody, his lips dark red as if he has been drinking blood. He turns to
<b>Floyd</b> | face you.

<b>Floyd</b> |    Swooning, you fall into the Falcon's arms. You are dimly aware of

<b>Floyd</b> |    The man with the rapier and the ring turns, "Sorry, I tried not to

<b>Floyd</b> | -- and in your presence!

<b>Floyd</b> | LATE ONE SPRING NIGHT IN THE WEST INDIES...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    A crash overhead! Pirates are boarding the Lafond Deux! The first
<b>Floyd</b> | mate hurries you into Captain Davis's cabin.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Good, you brought the girl," Davis smirks. "She'll keep the pirates
<b>Floyd</b> | busy. She was only a tool of Lafond's, anyway. Let me just find that
<b>Floyd</b> | cof--" A man on deck screams in agony and Davis starts. "Let's go." The
<b>Floyd</b> | captain thrusts you on the bed and walks out, locking the door.
<b>Floyd</b> |    His laugh echoes. "Best get comfortable, girl. You're likely to be
<b>Floyd</b> | there for the rest of your life."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Cabin, on the bed
<b>Floyd</b> |    You are in an officer's cabin, lit by the firelight glowing through
<b>Floyd</b> | a porthole. A door is to starboard. Except for the built-in bed, the
<b>Floyd</b> | room seems to have been emptied thoroughly, if hurriedly.

<b>Floyd</b> |    The deck is an avalanche of noise and blood. Lit by roaring fires,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | LATE ONE SPRING NIGHT IN THE WEST INDIES...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    A crash overhead! Pirates are boarding the Lafond Deux! The first
<b>Floyd</b> | mate hurries you into Captain Davis's cabin.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Good, you brought the girl," Davis smirks. "She'll keep the pirates
<b>Floyd</b> | busy. She was only a tool of Lafond's, anyway. Let me just find that
<b>Floyd</b> | cof--" A man on deck screams in agony and Davis starts. "Let's go." The
<b>Floyd</b> | captain thrusts you on the bed and walks out, locking the door.
<b>Floyd</b> |    His laugh echoes. "Best get comfortable, girl. You're likely to be
<b>Floyd</b> | there for the rest of your life."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Cabin, on the bed
<b>Floyd</b> |    You are in an officer's cabin, lit by the firelight glowing through
<b>Floyd</b> | a porthole. A door is to starboard. Except for the built-in bed, the
<b>Floyd</b> | room seems to have been emptied thoroughly, if hurriedly.

<b>Floyd</b> |    Nicholas looks determined. "I accept. So long as my people go free
<b>Floyd</b> | if I win. Order your dragoons to obey us, then." In answer, Lafond
<b>Floyd</b> | jumps off the cliff like a huge brocaded bat to land in front of
<b>Floyd</b> | Captain Jamison. "Die then, fool!"
<b>Floyd</b> |    The pistol, spinning from Lafond's grip, drops to the sand nearby.

<b>Floyd</b> |    Lafond immediately takes the advantage, forcing Nicholas in a
<b>Floyd</b> | retreat towards the foaming surf. But Nicholas fights hard, jaw set,
<b>Floyd</b> | ignoring his wounds. Lafond finally loses his smile.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Behind the duellists, far away atop the cliff, you notice Crulley
<b>Floyd</b> | madly reloading the pistol.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | You pour a lumpy stream of gunpowder mixture into the barrel of the
<b>Floyd</b> | pistol tamping it as best you can.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Suddenly the force of the duel turns, Nicholas advancing against
<b>Floyd</b> | Lafond's retreat. Their blades silently flash in the moonlight. Lafond
<b>Floyd</b> | is pressed back into the shadow of the cliff, sweat beading on his
<b>Floyd</b> | forehead. Abruptly, Jamison leaps forward, metal scrapes, and his
<b>Floyd</b> | rapier licks neatly into Lafond's ribs, like a snake slipping into its
<b>Floyd</b> | burrow. The body of the governor of St. Sinistra convulses, as in
<b>Floyd</b> | amazement, then sags dead on the sword.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Nicholas removes a gold ring from the dead man's finger, throwing
<b>Floyd</b> | his own cheap copy into the surf.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Far above him, Crulley moves down the stairs.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | You fire the pistol into the air. Startled by the loud report, Crulley
<b>Floyd</b> | jerks his pistol and fires, aiming not at Nicholas, but at you. You
<b>Floyd</b> | hear a distant scream, your own, and watch, as through from afar, your
<b>Floyd</b> | father wrestle Crulley to the ground. You feel only numbness as loving
<b>Floyd</b> | arms take you up, and Nicholas kisses you into death, his tears damp on
<b>Floyd</b> | your cheek.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |       ***   You have died   ***
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    In 435 turns, you have achieved a score of 25 out of 25 points.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Thus you have finished the story of PLUNDERED HEARTS, earning the
<b>Floyd</b> | title, "Love Transcending Death." There are other, perhaps more
