The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Another Earth, Another Sky</i>, written by Paul&nbsp;O'Brian.  <i>Another Earth, Another Sky</i> was originally released as part of the 2002 IF Competition, where it took first place.  It received Xyzzy nominations for Best Game, Best Individual NPC, Best Puzzles, Best Setting, and Best Writing, and ultimately took the Xyzzy for Best Use of Medium.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Another_Earth%2C_Another_Sky"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

<b>Floyd</b> | It's been quite a week.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Was it just two nights ago that you found the suits? You were
<b>Floyd</b> | searching through your parents' lab as usual, desperate for clues to
<b>Floyd</b> | explain their recent disappearance, when you found a latch on one of
<b>Floyd</b> | the machines. It opened, revealing two bodysuits crammed inside. One

<b>Floyd</b> | fit you perfectly. The other seemed to be made for your sister Emily.
<b>Floyd</b> | Hers, the "skysuit", gives her the power to fly, to generate thick
<b>Floyd</b> | fog, and to fire blasts of intense electrical energy, while your
<b>Floyd</b> | "earthsuit" has granted you the strength of a giant, and the
<b>Floyd</b> | invulnerability of a mountain.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The powers came in handy the next morning, when your parents' best
<b>Floyd</b> | friend, Dr. Nina Icolari, found herself transformed into a raging,
<b>Floyd</b> | hundred-foot-tall monster. Aunt Nina had been working with some
<b>Floyd</b> | ancient bacteria, trapped for eons in a salt crystal, when an untimely
<b>Floyd</b> | earthquake shattered the crystal. She inhaled the microbes, became a
<b>Floyd</b> | behemoth, and only the power of your suits and your brains saved the

<b>Floyd</b> | campus from destruction.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You employed a fast-acting antibiotic to reverse the transformation,
<b>Floyd</b> | and when she changed back, Aunt Nina realized that her memories of
<b>Floyd</b> | your parents' disappearance had been mysteriously altered... and that
<b>Floyd</b> | the trauma of metamorphosis had somehow restored them. Those memories

<b>Floyd</b> | have led you here, to a remote cabin in the Sierra Nevadas. Here, you
<b>Floyd</b> | hope that where the police have failed, Earth and Sky may succeed.

<b>Floyd</b> | Outside the Cabin
<b>Floyd</b> | The air is vivid and cold here, deep in the Sierra Nevada mountains.

<b>Floyd</b> | Evergreens surround you, except to the north, where a gravel driveway
<b>Floyd</b> | leads back to the main road, and to the south, where a small cabin
<b>Floyd</b> | occupies a clearing. Beyond the cabin, and above it, the observatory's
<b>Floyd</b> | domed roof casts a long, round shadow.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Emily is here, having just hiked up the driveway with you. "Thanks for

<b>Floyd</b> | driving us up here, Austin," she says. "Remember, though: I get
<b>Floyd</b> | control of the CD player on the way back down!"

<b>Floyd</b> | Some people might describe the interior of this cabin as "cozy", but

<b>Floyd</b> | Furnishings are minimal: a table, a few chairs, a hotplate, and a

<b>Floyd</b> | Main Room
<b>Floyd</b> | Some people might describe the interior of this cabin as "cozy", but
<b>Floyd</b> | you're more inclined to face facts and call it what it is: cramped.
<b>Floyd</b> | Furnishings are minimal: a table, a few chairs, a hotplate, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | television that probably hasn't worked since the mid-1980s. The back
<b>Floyd</b> | door is south and the front door north, and two doors on the eastern

<b>Floyd</b> | wall lead northeast and southeast, to the bedroom and bathroom
<b>Floyd</b> | respectively.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Emily is here, watching you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the table are some loose papers.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Emily takes a quick glance at the papers on the table, and exhales.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Listen, Austin," she says, "I find all these diagrams and
<b>Floyd</b> | observatories and whatnot a bit exhausting, so I'd like for you to

<b>Floyd</b> | return to the present as the border of the arctic area approaches --

<b>Floyd</b> | Ocean
<b>Floyd</b> | You're standing on silty ground, deep underwater. The light is dim,

<b>Floyd</b> | Sandy Dome
<b>Floyd</b> | You're in a dome, probably about ten feet high at its zenith and
<b>Floyd</b> | twenty feet in diameter at its base. The wall is transparent, but
<b>Floyd</b> | that's not too useful, since the entire dome appears to be buried in
<b>Floyd</b> | sand. There are several platforms on the ground, reaching to your hip
<b>Floyd</b> | and covered with a soft bedding on top, and to one side of these is a

<b>Floyd</b> | pedestal with a crimson touchplate. You can see no exits.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On one side of the dome, a large pile of sand covers the floor,
<b>Floyd</b> | drifting to its highest point at a junction of dome wall and floor.

<b>Floyd</b> | wall. And finally, there's no giant, gaping hole in the floor.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | This room appears to serve several purposes, at least one of which is

<b>Floyd</b> | You can also see a giant, catlike alien here.

<b>Floyd</b> | oval-slitted eyes burning with a combination of fury, frustration, and
