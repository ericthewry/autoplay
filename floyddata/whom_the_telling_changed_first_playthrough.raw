						<strong><em>Whom The Telling Changed</em> by Aaron A. Reed</strong><br/>
						
						<span class="fontish smallest">As played on ifMUD on March 16, 2014 (First Play-Through)</span>
					</p>


					<p class="leftalign">
					<span class="fontish smaller">The idea behind ClubFloyd
						is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of 
						people meet online to cooperatively play a game of 
						interactive fiction.<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of ClubFloyd's first play-through of 
						
						
						<em>Whom The Telling Changed</em> written by Aaron A. Reed. [Note: ClubFloyd's second play-through happened a week later, and that transcript can be found <A HREF="http://allthingsjacq.com/intfic_clubfloyd_20140305.html"><U>here</U></A>.]
						It was released in 2005. 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting

					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing this game, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played this game, and think you might like to at some
						point, I do not recommend reading any further. Instead,
						you might want to return to the <a class="decorate" href=

<b>Floyd</b> | "Humbaba the demon?" you ask. "Why was he so feared?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Humbaba the awful, he of many stories," the teller says. "His breath
<b>Floyd</b> | is a firestorm; his voice is the floodwaters; his jaws are death
<b>Floyd</b> | itself. Horrible to look at is the demon Humbaba, and the few who saw
<b>Floyd</b> | him and survived could not describe his face."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The story moves on. "The heart of Gilgamesh burned with the words of
<b>Floyd</b> | SHAMASH," says the teller. "Gilgamesh sought out his friend Enkidu and
<b>Floyd</b> | said to him: 'You came from the wild. My friend, you came from the
<b>Floyd</b> | wild and you know the secret paths of animals. Do you know the way to
<b>Floyd</b> | the Cedar Forest?'
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Enkidu SIGHED and his heart grew heavy," says the teller, and then
<b>Floyd</b> | seems to become young and strong as the gruff guise of Enkidu comes
<b>Floyd</b> | over her. "'Yes, I know the way to the Cedar Forest, but it is long
<b>Floyd</b> | and lonely. And what awaits you at its end but the demon Humbaba? The

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Words flew between these two firebrands, but their rancor was too

<b>Floyd</b> | This is a story about a healer in the village who was in love with a

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Words flew between these two firebrands, but their rancor was too

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thank you for interacting with "Whom The Telling Changed." If you
<b>Floyd</b> | haven't already, try playing again and pursuing a different path.
<b>Floyd</b> | There are many ways to experience this story, and many perspectives
<b>Floyd</b> | you may encounter: what you assumed to be right and wrong, good and
<b>Floyd</b> | evil with one play-through may not be as simple as you thought. Your
<b>Floyd</b> | very first action sets your course, but there are many ways to alter
<b>Floyd</b> | it as both stories progress, some surprising.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The storyteller's tale is part of the Epic of Gilgamesh, the oldest
<b>Floyd</b> | story recorded by human history, originating in Sumeria more than
<b>Floyd</b> | 4,000 years ago. The specific words used by the teller are my own, a
<b>Floyd</b> | mishmash of various versions of the Humbaba story from Sumer, Babylon,
<b>Floyd</b> | and Akkadia. The quest of the Cedar Forest is only a small part of the
<b>Floyd</b> | full epic, which is well worth reading or re-reading.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The setting of my frame story is not meant to be any more specific
<b>Floyd</b> | than somewhere in the Fertile Crescent, thousands of years ago, but to
<b>Floyd</b> | fill in the details of atmosphere and setting I am indebted to Karen
<b>Floyd</b> | Rhea Nemet-Nejat's book "Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia." The
<b>Floyd</b> | various translations of the Gilgamesh epic were also very useful:
<b>Floyd</b> | specifically, those of Mitchell, Ferry, and Gardner/Maier, all of
<b>Floyd</b> | which are beautiful and readable versions of the work.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks also to my beta testers James Cunningham, Michael Fransioli,
<b>Floyd</b> | and Henrik 'Drix' Jensen, to storyteller Beth Horner, and to the
<b>Floyd</b> | friends who helped me wrestle the very nebulous concept for this piece
<b>Floyd</b> | towards its final implementation.
