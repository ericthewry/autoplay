						is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of 
						people meet online to cooperatively play a game of 
						interactive fiction.<br>

						<em>Changes</em> written by David Given.  <em>Changes</em> was released as part of the 2012 Interactive Fiction Competition, in which it took fourth place.

<b>Floyd</b> | projecting from where a chest should be. The eyes gaze into yours.
<b>Floyd</b> | There is still life and desperation there, but it it knows that it is

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | Changes is a game by David Given. This is the IFComp 2012 edition.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you're new to interactive fiction, I would strongly suggest visiting
<b>Floyd</b> | a website such as [<a href="http://pr-if.org/play">LINK</A>], which will explain what it's
<b>Floyd</b> | all about and what the commands are.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As basic advice for playing Changes: the game can be completed using
<b>Floyd</b> | simple verb-noun commands. If you find yourself trying to do things
<b>Floyd</b> | with other things, or putting stuff on top of other stuff, you may want
<b>Floyd</b> | to try reconsidering your approach.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game is polite by the Zarfian Cruelty Scale. There are occasions
<b>Floyd</b> | when the game can become uncompletable but it's totally obvious when
<b>Floyd</b> | this has happened.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you have any comments or feedback or cakes, please send them to
<b>Floyd</b> | dg@cowlark.com.

<b>Floyd</b> | and dark, and in the dim light makes an almost perfect mirror.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Rather than the face you were expecting --- a battered one, but human
<b>Floyd</b> | --- you instead see a furry snout with bulbous eyes on each side and a
<b>Floyd</b> | wide mouth.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You recognise it from the survey report: the temporary name tagged on
<b>Floyd</b> | the creature is rabbit, for fairly obvious reasons. Numbly, you find
<b>Floyd</b> | yourself interested that you're finally seeing one up close.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's definitely you. Now you're actually noticing, it's perfectly
<b>Floyd</b> | apparent that the body you're inhabiting is not your own. The fact that
<b>Floyd</b> | it feels totally natural is strangely unnerving.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But that still doesn't explain how, or why, although you can make a
<b>Floyd</b> | decent guess at where.

<b>Floyd</b> | It's an awesome sight. You've never seen anything this big that was
<b>Floyd</b> | alive before. At least, not in person. You recognise it from the
<b>Floyd</b> | Concerto's survey photographs: it's a Mother Tree.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Mother Tree is, according to the Concerto, a commensal plant which
<b>Floyd</b> | is semi-symbiotic on the surrounding wildlife. Actually getting more
<b>Floyd</b> | details was like pulling hen's teeth; the ship wouldn't answer
<b>Floyd</b> | questions about them, and the survey department seemed to be almost
<b>Floyd</b> | frightened. Eventually you managed to push enough alcohol down Francis

<b>Floyd</b> | the Mother Tree. In panic, you dive behind a tree.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A shape emerges from the light of the river arch: one rabbit dragging
<b>Floyd</b> | another. The one that is doing the pulling is a bit bigger than you
<b>Floyd</b> | are, and marked in black and white. The one on the ground... is
<b>Floyd</b> | obviously dead, eyes staring, grey fur tattered and muddy. It's heavy
<b>Floyd</b> | and awkward and the black and white rabbit is having difficulty moving
<b>Floyd</b> | it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you watch, one of the green cocoons silently splits open and
<b>Floyd</b> | unfolds. The black and white rabbit glances in your direction and then
<b>Floyd</b> | continues dragging the corpse after it into the cocoon.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ...the rabbit knows very little, but it knows this: its companion was
<b>Floyd</b> | once alive, and is now dead. And it wants it to be alive. This cannot
<b>Floyd</b> | happen, but there is a way they can be reunited, and the Mother Tree is
<b>Floyd</b> | kind. The rabbit is old and tired but it has enough strength to do
<b>Floyd</b> | this, and so it drags the rigid corpse to the Mother Tree. The strange
<b>Floyd</b> | zombie rabbit is watching it, but that is unimportant now. All there is
<b>Floyd</b> | left to do is wait.

<b>Floyd</b> | Rather than the face you were expecting --- a battered one, but human

<b>Floyd</b> | wide mouth.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You recognise it from the survey report: the temporary name tagged on
<b>Floyd</b> | the creature is <span class="floydstyle em">rabbit</span>, for fairly obvious reasons. Numbly,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's definitely you. Now you're actually <span class="floydstyle em">noticing</span>, it's

<b>Floyd</b> | The fact that it feels totally natural is strangely unnerving.

<b>Floyd</b> | A shape emerges from the light of the river arch: one rabbit dragging

<b>Floyd</b> | obviously dead, eyes staring, grey fur tattered and muddy. It's heavy
<b>Floyd</b> | and awkward and the black and white rabbit is having difficulty moving

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you watch, one of the green cocoons silently splits open and
<b>Floyd</b> | unfolds. The black and white rabbit glances in your direction and then
<b>Floyd</b> | continues dragging the corpse after it into the cocoon.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">...the rabbit knows very little, but it knows this: its companion</span>

<b>Floyd</b> | The ground here is steep and rocky, but still covered with scrawny

<b>Floyd</b> | A massive slab of rock has fallen into the woods from the canyon walls

<b>Floyd</b> | You are perched at the very north-west tip of the canyon, where the
<b>Floyd</b> | slopes disintegrate into a tangle of smashed rock. Wiry, heather-like
<b>Floyd</b> | grass grows between the gaps between the boulders, and there are even
<b>Floyd</b> | a few trees. Below to the east is a maelstrom of white water at the
<b>Floyd</b> | head of the river; to the south, the slope begins to flatten.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Tiny multicoloured birds dart back and forth on the cliff face above
<b>Floyd</b> | you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You almost run into the fox again. It eagerly begins to chase you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can feel hope from the south, and irritation from the east.
