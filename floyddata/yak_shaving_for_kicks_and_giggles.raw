The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Yak Shaving for Kicks and Giggles!</i>, written by J. J. Guest.  <I>Yak Shaving for Kicks and Giggles!</I> was originally released as part of the Odd Competiton, where it took third place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Yak_Shaving_for_Kicks_and_Giggles!'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You are Steve Goodwin. You're a regular guy, young, successful,
<b>Floyd</b> | dynamic. Recently promoted to the post of junior marketing executive at
<b>Floyd</b> | the Funhouse Novelty Company, you're the one who comes up with all
<b>Floyd</b> | those zany items you can buy for a Dollar in the pages of Cosmic
<b>Floyd</b> | Comics.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But something is missing in your life. A nagging question gnaws at your
<b>Floyd</b> | soul, undermines your joy at your new-found success and interferes with
<b>Floyd</b> | the very business of living. But this is not a answer you can find in
<b>Floyd</b> | the pages of any book; for what you yearn to know is the very meaning
<b>Floyd</b> | of life itself!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But then you learned about a man, a guru of great wisdom, endowed with
<b>Floyd</b> | the miraculous supreme realisation who could teach him the secrets of
<b>Floyd</b> | the universe. A six hundred year old hermit living at the top of a
<b>Floyd</b> | mountain in a kingdom most right-thinking people assume to be a myth. A
<b>Floyd</b> | man known as the Dada Lama!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And this is why we find you now, after many months of journeying, of
<b>Floyd</b> | fruitless searching, beaten and battered by the uncaring elements, in
<b>Floyd</b> | this mysterious valley hidden deep within the mountains...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ...the mystical valley of Shangri-La!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Yak Shaving for Kicks and Giggles!
<b>Floyd</b> | A Philosophical Odyssey by J. J. Guest

<b>Floyd</b> | 6/12N)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Shangri-La
<b>Floyd</b> | You weren't sure what to expect from the mystic valley of Shangri-La.
<b>Floyd</b> | You'd heard all the stories of course -- a land of mystery and
<b>Floyd</b> | matchless beauty where life is lived in tranquil wonder, beyond the
<b>Floyd</b> | grasp of a doomed world! That's what it said in the brochure, anyway...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What you weren't expecting was a caravan park. But there's no mistaking
<b>Floyd</b> | the large sign over the entrance: "Shangri-La Caravan Park welcomes the
<b>Floyd</b> | pure of soul -- 200 Spaces Available." Most of the spaces are empty.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Directly ahead is perhaps the loveliest mountain you have ever seen; an
<b>Floyd</b> | almost perfect cone of snow, it is as though a small child had dropped
<b>Floyd</b> | a Cornetto in the middle of the valley. A broad path leads north to the
<b>Floyd</b> | mountain, and on either side are narrow trails leading northeast and
<b>Floyd</b> | northwest.

<TD><b>inky</b>  | For a long time the idea of selling frozen ice-cream cones had been impractical, as the ice cream would soak into the cone during the manufacturing process and make it soggy and unpalatable when served. It was in 1959 that Spica[1], an Italian ice-cream manufacturer based in Naples, overcame this problem by insulating the inside of the waffle cone from the ice-cream with a coating of oil, sugar and chocolate.
</TD><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>inky</b>  | The brand was marketed by a successful advertising campaign which placed the Italian song O Sole Mio into a variety of stereotypical Italian locations and situations, with its lyrics changed to:[1] Just one Cornetto, give it to me, delicious ice-cream, of Italy, vanilla and choco dream, Give me Cornetto, from Wall's ice cream.

<b>Floyd</b> | Inner Sanctum
<b>Floyd</b> | After your long and arduous journey it's hard not to be disappointed by
<b>Floyd</b> | the famous Sanctum Sanctorum of his Holiness the Dada Lama. Sure,
<b>Floyd</b> | incense burners and mandalas abound, but there's no getting away from
<b>Floyd</b> | the fact that this is nothing more than a shabby old trailer home with
<b>Floyd</b> | seating that folds up to provide additional storage.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | His holiness the Dada Lama, Exalted Master of Excelling Works, sits in
<b>Floyd</b> | the middle of a bubbling hot-tub surrounded by topless beauties.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The brunette massages the old man's scalp whilst the blonde lovingly
<b>Floyd</b> | soaps his scanty beard.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I have been expecting you, oh faithful disciple!" says the Dada Lama
<b>Floyd</b> | as you enter.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You don't look like you were expecting anyone," you reply, glancing at
<b>Floyd</b> | the blonde as she ladles hot water over his shiny dome.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Do not be deceived by appearances, my son." says the Lama, "In
<b>Floyd</b> | Shangri-La we live a life of simple austerity. This hot tub is merely
<b>Floyd</b> | an illusion. Candy and Mitzi here are neophytes who, like yourself, are
<b>Floyd</b> | taking their first faltering steps on the path to enlightenment. You
<b>Floyd</b> | seek the ancient wisdom of the exalted masters, yes?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Something like that," you reply.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well wisdom must be earned. Take this jar of pickled eggs. If you can
<b>Floyd</b> | get the lid off, enlightenment will be yours. Now, go!"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Directly ahead is perhaps the loveliest mountain you have ever seen; an

<b>Floyd</b> | Shangri-La
<b>Floyd</b> | You weren't sure what to expect from the mystic valley of Shangri-La.
<b>Floyd</b> | You'd heard all the stories of course -- a land of mystery and
<b>Floyd</b> | matchless beauty where life is lived in tranquil wonder, beyond the
<b>Floyd</b> | grasp of a doomed world! That's what it said in the brochure, anyway...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What you weren't expecting was a caravan park. But there's no mistaking
<b>Floyd</b> | the large sign over the entrance: "Shangri-La Caravan Park welcomes the
<b>Floyd</b> | pure of soul -- 200 Spaces Available." Most of the spaces are empty.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Directly ahead is perhaps the loveliest mountain you have ever seen; an
<b>Floyd</b> | almost perfect cone of snow, it is as though a small child had dropped
<b>Floyd</b> | a Cornetto in the middle of the valley. A broad path leads north to the
<b>Floyd</b> | mountain, and on either side are narrow trails leading northeast and
<b>Floyd</b> | northwest.
