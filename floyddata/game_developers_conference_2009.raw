The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Game Developers Conference 2009</i>, written by Jim Munroe.  <i>Game Developers Conference 2009</i> was originally released in May of 2009.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Game_Developers_Conference_2009"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

<b>Floyd</b> | You're actually here. The Gee Dee Cee. You don't know which session to
<b>Floyd</b> | check out first. Unlike your hometown, you're one promoter among many
<b>Floyd</b> | here -- exciting and intimidating.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Exciting because between now and Friday you might be able to put
<b>Floyd</b> | together a game development team with the varied people here, but
<b>Floyd</b> | intimidating because you don't know a soul. Luckily people all have
<b>Floyd</b> | their names printed on their badges, that's one thing you don't have to
<b>Floyd</b> | worry about.

<b>Floyd</b> | Moscone Center South 2000
<b>Floyd</b> | Geez, there's a lot of people here. You wish your buddy Jon had come.
<b>Floyd</b> | He had a ton of advice about getting to know people. What was it that
<b>Floyd</b> | he said? You bet you could REMEMBER if you tried.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can go north to Moscone Center North 2000, east to art session
<b>Floyd</b> | "Lighting With Purpose" and west to the code session "AI Behaviors from
<b>Floyd</b> | Improvisational Actors".

<b>Floyd</b> | that taking a personal INVENTORY helps you keep track of your skills
<b>Floyd</b> | and interests... and when in doubt, GO WEST?
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You dunno about that last one, especially since he went on to rant
<b>Floyd</b> | about twisty mazes, but you (perhaps aptly) couldn't follow what he was
<b>Floyd</b> | saying.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But he did have some other helpful stuff to say too, you'd just need to

<b>Floyd</b> | Over beers the day before you left, he got philosophical. Sure, there's
<b>Floyd</b> | a lot of swag, but it's not about what you can TAKE, he said. It's
<b>Floyd</b> | about the exchange of ideas. ASK people ABOUT something they care
<b>Floyd</b> | about. If you don't know, ASK them ABOUT INTERESTS. And if you have an
<b>Floyd</b> | interest, TALK ABOUT it TO them -- maybe your enthusiasm about it will

<b>Floyd</b> | catch. And he said not to worry about getting it right the first time,
<b>Floyd</b> | that it can take a couple of years to get into the groove.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You're pretty sure there was some other stuff he said, too.

<b>Floyd</b> | Jon got a little drunk and started to brag that he was around when he

<b>Floyd</b> | to grouse about the economy and how he wished he was going this year,
<b>Floyd</b> | and the evening went downhill from there. He pointed out that because
<b>Floyd</b> | you're an extreme extrovert, you'd have to be careful not to talk
<b>Floyd</b> | people's ears off.
<b>Floyd</b> |  (Which seemed kind of personal to you, but Jon has a tact deficit.)

<b>Floyd</b> | you couldn't get a coder or an artist -- it's pretty random who you're

<b>Floyd</b> | that taking a personal INVENTORY helps you keep track of your skills

<b>Floyd</b> | and interests... and when in doubt, GO WEST?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You dunno about that last one, especially since he went on to rant
<b>Floyd</b> | about twisty mazes, but you (perhaps aptly) couldn't follow what he was
<b>Floyd</b> | saying.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | But he did have some other helpful stuff to say too, you'd just need to
<b>Floyd</b> | focus to REMEMBER it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Over beers the day before you left, he got philosophical. Sure, there's
<b>Floyd</b> | a lot of swag, but it's not about what you can TAKE, he said. It's

<b>Floyd</b> | about the exchange of ideas. ASK people ABOUT something they care
<b>Floyd</b> | about. If you don't know, ASK them ABOUT INTERESTS. And if you have an
<b>Floyd</b> | interest, TALK ABOUT it TO them -- maybe your enthusiasm about it will
<b>Floyd</b> | catch. And he said not to worry about getting it right the first time,
<b>Floyd</b> | that it can take a couple of years to get into the groove.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You're pretty sure there was some other stuff he said, too.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Jon got a little drunk and started to brag that he was around when he
<b>Floyd</b> | saw someone PROPOSE GAME WITH VECTOR GRAPHICS TO DAVE. Then he started
<b>Floyd</b> | to grouse about the economy and how he wished he was going this year,

<b>Floyd</b> | and the evening went downhill from there. He pointed out that because
<b>Floyd</b> | you're an extrovert, you'd have to be careful not to talk people's ears
<b>Floyd</b> | off.
<b>Floyd</b> |  (Which seemed kind of personal to you, but Jon has a tact deficit.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now that you're thinking of it, wasn't there something else he said?

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Right before you extricated yourself, Jon had one more piece of advice
<b>Floyd</b> | -- to make sure you checked out the dev team workshop when you thought
<b>Floyd</b> | you had a team together. The other workshops were useful too, in case
<b>Floyd</b> | you couldn't get a coder or an artist -- it's pretty random who you're

<b>Floyd</b> | gonna meet, he said. He started on about something else but you told
<b>Floyd</b> | him you had an early plane to catch.
