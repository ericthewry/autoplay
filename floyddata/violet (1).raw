The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Violet</i>, written by Jeremy&nbsp;Freese.  <i>Violet</i> was originally released as part of the 2008 IF Competition, where it took first place. You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Violet"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

</br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

</TD><td></td><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | Apparently a tradition in these games is that a victorious player is
<b>Floyd</b> | allowed to view a list of humorous things they may've missed on the
<b>Floyd</b> | path to triumph.  While I remain nonplussed that a stranger has turned
<b>Floyd</b> | one of the more emotionally complicated days of my romantic life into a

<b>Floyd</b> | "text adventure" game, I've resolved to be a sport about it.
<b>Floyd</b> | Forthwith, then, let me review some possibly-overlooked highlights of
<b>Floyd</b> | our neuroses:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 1.  ABOUT, CREDITS, and COPYRIGHT were also written by Actual Me.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | 2.  On your computer, you can OPEN BROWSER (multiple times), OPEN
<b>Floyd</b> | E-MAIL (ditto), and OPEN CHAT (eek).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 3.  Various commands commonly implemented in other games have their own
<b>Floyd</b> | responses here, including QUIT, BUY (something), SING, SCORE, SECRETS,
<b>Floyd</b> | TOPICS, TIME, SORRY, NORMAL, SHORT, VERBOSE, THINK ABOUT something,

<b>Floyd</b> | REMEMBER, CRY, WAVE, and the traditional magic word XYZZY.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 4.  After you SHAKE THE GLOBE, EXAMINE IT for a few successive turns
<b>Floyd</b> | and/or EXAMINE THE FIGURINE.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 5.  Some things you may have missed examining along the way: ME, JULIA

<b>Floyd</b> | (once she's around), LIQUID, GUNK, THREAD (then take something), GUM a
<b>Floyd</b> | second time, ZOMBIE (couple of times), PIRATE, CEILING, WALL, and
<b>Floyd</b> | FLOOR.  Also, the notebook has several pages to READ and its lenticular
<b>Floyd</b> | cover changes messages when you examine it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 6.  Some of the ways to achieve less happy endings to the game are to

<b>Floyd</b> | BURN PILE, insist on trying to OPEN DOOR once Julia is around, MOVE
<b>Floyd</b> | STOOL TO CORNER and STAND ON STOOL, MAKE LOVE TO JULIA, either EXAMINE
<b>Floyd</b> | BOOK too many times or carry the book too many turns, and THROW
<b>Floyd</b> | WASTEBASKET AT PEN.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 7.  Much miscellany, a few examples of which are LOOK UNDER DESK,

<b>Floyd</b> | SWALLOW GUM and KEY, DELETE BROWSER or CHAT, BURN
<b>Floyd</b> | COASTER/PLATYPOD/CACTUS, PUT SQUARE IN POUCH, OPEN VENT, ASK VIOLET
<b>Floyd</b> | ABOUT SOMETHING, PUT KEY IN PILE (after cable is in cabinet), RIP
<b>Floyd</b> | CABLE, do anything to the JACK, PUT things in NOSE, KICK something,
<b>Floyd</b> | CLIMB BOOKCASE, TAKE VIOLET, and SLIDE KEY UNDER DOOR.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | 8.  As (bonus!) easter eggs, WARREN EGG presents all the Warren Tim
<b>Floyd</b> | Harried tracks, JULIA EGG presents all the main events across the hall,
<b>Floyd</b> | and PETNAME EGG greets you with one of my petnames.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm debuting a new line of stainless steel numbats at the shop and
<b>Floyd</b> | won't keep prattling.  My husband has sworn off the Internet and so

<b>Floyd</b> | can't type this himself, but he wanted me to tell you hello and that,
<b>Floyd</b> | even though he's sometimes wistful about not finishing his Ph.D., it
<b>Floyd</b> | was plainly for the best.

<b>Floyd</b> | 5.  I don't know why I confided in Lucy about our problems.  I should

<b>Floyd</b> | 9.  You are distracted by Julia going on loudly about how you get a

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 10.  You are distracted by Julia talking about her [bother].  I can't

<b>Floyd</b> | 11.  You are distracted by Julia saying especially loudly, "Impressive,
<b>Floyd</b> | huh?  When I was in high school my guidance counsellor recommended that
<b>Floyd</b> | I become a contortionist."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 12.  You are distracted by Julia saying especially loudly, "It's not so

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hey!  Watch it, Julia.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | 14.  You are distracted by Julia saying "She makes things that look

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I wonder if I'd get away with it if I killed her right before my flight

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | 15.  You are distracted by Julia loudly saying "I bet when they first

<b>Floyd</b> | has to be the most gallingly inept fake Australian accent I have ever
<b>Floyd</b> | heard.  She sounds like a Norwegian parakeet.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 16.  You are distracted by Julia laughing and mock-shrieking "Or maybe,

<b>Floyd</b> | 'Touch my kiwi!  Touch my kiwi!'"  Ugh.  How can someone almost have
<b>Floyd</b> | her Ph.D. and not know that kiwis are New Zealand, not Australia?

<b>Floyd</b> | 19.  You are distracted by a startled grunt from Historic Pfister.  I

<b>Floyd</b> | 20.  You are distracted by Historic Pfister making noises perhaps best
<b>Floyd</b> | characterised as mewling.

<b>Floyd</b> | and you are 24, that makes this your golden birthday."  Well, then.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 22.  You are distracted by Historic Pfister's shrieking attempts to

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 23.  You are distracted by Historic Pfister saying excitedly, "Okay,

<b>Floyd</b> | now you're a princess, and I'm a ninja!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 24.  You are distracted by Historic Pfister making a noise that doesn't

<b>Floyd</b> | ninja I don't know about.
