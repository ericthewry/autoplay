						The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each
						week at a pre-arranged time, a group of
						people meet online to cooperatively play
						a game of interactive fiction.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Tree and Star</em> written by Paul Lee.
						 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting

					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing this game, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played this game, and think you might like to at some

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Heavy boots clang against the metal stands.  Vertias yelps, and

<b>Floyd</b> | "Chronos Han, you are under arrest for disobeying the sanctions

<b>Floyd</b> | Time passes...
<b>Floyd</b> | "There the first Ancestors communed with the Fey folk that dwelt
<b>Floyd</b> | in the elemental Forms.  The trees stretched as high as a hundred men
<b>Floyd</b> | are tall, and spread their many arms to shade the living ground.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | winds gathered in the canopy of the Lower Heaven and bent down to kiss
<b>Floyd</b> | Land with their sweet breath.  The roaming beasts, great and small,
<b>Floyd</b> | ruled the wilds where the people did not walk, but begged at the feet
<b>Floyd</b> | of the Ancestors."
<b>Floyd</b> | The Storyteller nods, his eyes distant.  "And there was the
<b>Floyd</b> | mighty sea, a great expanse like the heaven above, but formed of the
<b>Floyd</b> | gathering of all the waters of Land, encircling the planet in its
<b>Floyd</b> | embrace."  The Storyteller turns his head up to look at the stars.
<b>Floyd</b> | The storyteller brings his gaze to the audience and clasps his
<b>Floyd</b> | hands in front of him, turning slowly to look over all the people in
<b>Floyd</b> | the stands.  He begins to speak again, firmly.  "But the Ancestors
<b>Floyd</b> | became arrogant..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Heavy boots clang against the metal stands.  Vertias yelps, and
<b>Floyd</b> | you turn to see men in black uniforms trample down the stands to the
<b>Floyd</b> | platform, shoving people out of the way.  One of them steps right over
<b>Floyd</b> | you and Veritas and corners the old Storyteller on the platform.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Chronos Han, you are under arrest for disobeying the sanctions

</b><b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Tree and Star</span> is a story-based work of interactive fiction.
<b>Floyd</b> | If you are not already familiar with interactive fiction or text
<b>Floyd</b> | adventures (as they are more traditionally known), be advised that
<b>Floyd</b> | this game probably takes a lot of the conventions and stereotypes of
<b>Floyd</b> | the current mainstream IF community for granted, and therefore may not
<b>Floyd</b> | be well suited for someone not already familiar with those
<b>Floyd</b> | conventions.  However, please feel welcome to try it.  Theoretically,
<b>Floyd</b> | all you need to know is that at the command prompt (&gt;), you type a
<b>Floyd</b> | simple command for the player character to follow, in the form of VERB
<b>Floyd</b> | OBJECT, such as "TAKE LAMP" or "UNLOCK DOOR" or "ACTIVATE WARP DRIVE."
<b>Floyd</b> | Good luck; you'll need it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Players already familiar with interactive fiction mainly need to know
<b>Floyd</b> | that the command TALK TO is required in order to complete this game.
<b>Floyd</b> | The command does not necessarily assimilate all other commands for NPC
<b>Floyd</b> | interaction.  Specifically, it may be necessary to hand an object over
<b>Floyd</b> | to an NPC with the command GIVE.  Issuing specific orders to NPCs is
<b>Floyd</b> | not implemented.  There are also some non-standard verbs, mostly
<b>Floyd</b> | related to computer activities.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There are three mutually-exclusive paths through this game, although
<b>Floyd</b> | each path does not necessarily correspond to a unique ending.  One of
<b>Floyd</b> | the paths is shorter and easier than the other two and is considered
<b>Floyd</b> | less satisfactory.  Although this game is technically not
<b>Floyd</b> | "unwinnable," it is possible to become locked out of the two better
<b>Floyd</b> | endings.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There has been no update to the mission log for 24 years, as the
<b>Floyd</b> | situation has not changed.  Since the death of Captain Iero, the
<b>Floyd</b> | yonger generation raised by the military has formed a militia and has
<b>Floyd</b> | seized control.  The bridge has been closed off.  Study of the cosmic
<b>Floyd</b> | radiation is being officially terminated, although most research was
<b>Floyd</b> | abandoned long ago.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is my belief that the radiation is intrinsically tied to the
<b>Floyd</b> | anomaly that overtook us, that it may hold the key to our deliverance.
<b>Floyd</b> | A synopsis of the knowledge acquired about the radiation through
<b>Floyd</b> | research and about the circumstances that lead to our present
<b>Floyd</b> | situation follows.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The emissions are similar to the cosmic noise left over from the birth
<b>Floyd</b> | of the universe, but more intense and focused in a single vector, as
<b>Floyd</b> | if it were a transmitted signal.  The radiation spans the entire
<b>Floyd</b> | electromagnetic spectrum.  It must also run much deeper than the known
<b>Floyd</b> | spectrum, because dark matter distortions were registered in
<b>Floyd</b> | frequencies corresponding to the emissions.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We first discovered the signal emanating from the exact same vector in
<b>Floyd</b> | which the ancient artifact had been travelling before it was lost,
<b>Floyd</b> | originating from an unknown point outside of the galaxy.  This is too
<b>Floyd</b> | vastly improbable to be coincidental.  We do not know what happened to
<b>Floyd</b> | this artifac, which has served as our beacon, leading us to and in
<b>Floyd</b> | this journey in the dark.  Nor do we know the relationship between the
<b>Floyd</b> | artificat and the radiation.  All we know is that when we synchronized
<b>Floyd</b> | our propulsion drives with the frequency of the signal, the stars
<b>Floyd</b> | disappeared from the viewports, and our navigation systems failed.
<b>Floyd</b> | Our propulsion system was functioning until the photon generators were
<b>Floyd</b> | salvaged 8 years ago, but attempts to travel through this void have
<b>Floyd</b> | yielded no results, as there is no frame of reference to determine
<b>Floyd</b> | motion.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I expect that this will be the final entry in the mission log.  This
<b>Floyd</b> | file will be added to the bios of the system synchronization network,
<b>Floyd</b> | to be displayed whenever the network is activated.  It is my hope that
<b>Floyd</b> | the next generation will one day renew the study of the emissions, and
<b>Floyd</b> | that our descendents will one day find a way to return to normal
<b>Floyd</b> | space. Good luck, and God speed -- to you and to those whom we left
<b>Floyd</b> | behind.

<b>Floyd</b> | The laser beam grinds edge of the hole blasted through the

<b>Floyd</b> | Chronos approaches.  "Allow me," he says, gesturing for you to

<b>Floyd</b> |      The room shakes with an explosion, followed by footsteps.
<b>Floyd</b> |      "They should be here," a gruff masculine voice says.
<b>Floyd</b> | The footsteps thud the length of the room.  You hear the contents
<b>Floyd</b> | of the shelves being thrown roughly out of the racks.  A guard wearing
<b>Floyd</b> | a shock-suit comes into view at the end of your rack.  "They may have
<b>Floyd</b> | escaped," the guard says, gesturing at the aft exit with her gun.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Search this room first," says the first voice.  "I'm reading
<b>Floyd</b> | life signs."
<b>Floyd</b> | The guard standing at the end of the two racks between which you
<b>Floyd</b> | hand suddenly yells, dropping her gun as a point on her arm erupts in
<b>Floyd</b> | flame.  As the guard jumps to the side, the retort of gunfire resounds
<b>Floyd</b> | several times more, coming from the aft exit.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Proceed!  The lifesigns must be coming from the other side of
<b>Floyd</b> | the wall!"  A guard runs past your rack, firing through the aft exit.
<b>Floyd</b> | He steps to one side of the opening as the rest of the guards file
<b>Floyd</b> | quickly past.
<b>Floyd</b> | The guard holds up his fist, stopping the last two of his
<b>Floyd</b> | underlings from leaving.  "Burn this stuff," he says, firing his
<b>Floyd</b> | weapon into the racks of artifacts.  The other two guards follow his
<b>Floyd</b> | example, blasting the contents of the racks.  You and Veritas pull
<b>Floyd</b> | Chronos down to the floor, flattening yourselves as charges explode
<b>Floyd</b> | over your heads.  As they turn to leave, the guards shoot the floor,
<b>Floyd</b> | igniting the soft material.
<b>Floyd</b> | Chronos rises stiffly and brushes himself off.  He looks over the
<b>Floyd</b> | devastion and grimaces.

<b>Floyd</b> | You look over the audience, drawing a slow, deep breath.  Veritas
<b>Floyd</b> | beams at you.
<b>Floyd</b> | "The Ancestors did not live as we do.  They lived on and communed
<b>Floyd</b> | with the very spheres of the Heavens themselves.  We were never meant
<b>Floyd</b> | to go on living in these ships forever.  We need Land.  We need Sea.
<b>Floyd</b> | We need Wind.  We need Trees.
<b>Floyd</b> | "At least now we once again have the stars.  During the Great
<b>Floyd</b> | Journey from the Old Heavens, our ancestors saw no stars for many
<b>Floyd</b> | generations.  Some thought that the stars were no more than a story
<b>Floyd</b> | told to ignorant children before sleep rotation.  Most of those who
<b>Floyd</b> | knew that the Heavens really had once existed thought that the stars
<b>Floyd</b> | had actually vanished altogether.  In our arrogance, we allowed
<b>Floyd</b> | ourselves to believe that we had no need for the stars.  The Council
<b>Floyd</b> | declared that we were the only light, that our Fleet was the entire
<b>Floyd</b> | universe.
<b>Floyd</b> | "But there was one man who remembered.  His name was Chronos Han.
<b>Floyd</b> | As a young Systems Tech on the <span class="floydstyle em">Galaxy</span>, Chronos saw the
<b>Floyd</b> | ancient systems that had long since been shut away or ransacked.  He
<b>Floyd</b> | dedicated his life to finding out the true purpose of the Fleet, of
<b>Floyd</b> | learning all he could about the Ancestors.  He boldly declared that
<b>Floyd</b> | the Fleet was not all that is, that we came from the Heavens and that
<b>Floyd</b> | our fate was bound together with the Heavens.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Chronos suffered many things at the hands of arrogant people.
<b>Floyd</b> | He was imprisoned several times by the Militia and was tortured at the
<b>Floyd</b> | order Council in an attempt to make him recant.  He and his family
<b>Floyd</b> | were threatened, his property confiscated, his name maligned.  No
<b>Floyd</b> | matter what was done to him, he never stopped insisting that the
<b>Floyd</b> | Heavens were real, until he was proven right beyond all possibility of
<b>Floyd</b> | denial.
<b>Floyd</b> | "The stars reappeared at last, after a hundred generations had
<b>Floyd</b> | lived died without them.  But sadly, our foolish arrogance is so great
<b>Floyd</b> | that we very soon forgot the Ancestors once again, and we went on
<b>Floyd</b> | living as if the Fleet itself were our only purpose.  Chronos gave his
<b>Floyd</b> | life so that we could have evidence to hold on to, so that we can
<b>Floyd</b> | believe that we came from a better place and are still seeking a
<b>Floyd</b> | better existence.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Be sure that we will forget again, because we are always
<b>Floyd</b> | devouring ourselves in our arrogance.  However, it is just as certain
<b>Floyd</b> | that people will always long for the depths of the past and the
<b>Floyd</b> | promise of destiny.  That is why we will not utterly forget, until our

I played elusions in the Toyshop all by my lonesome the other night.

When I had it for Frotz aeons ago, I never figured out how. :-) I could find an Inform interpreter that works with my screen reader--I'm sure there is one--but my MUD client actually allows me to copy and paste, which an Inform client probably would not, and the output is generated in such a way that I don't have to fiddle with my screen reader's review cursor (which I know i would have to do in something like Winfrotz)."
