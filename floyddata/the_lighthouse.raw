The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>The Lighthouse</i>, written by Marius Müller.  <I>The Lighthouse</I> was originally released as part of the 2009 Saugus.net Halloween Ghost Story Contest, where it tied for first place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/The_Lighthouse_(by_Marius_Mueller)'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What a way to end a holiday.
<b>Floyd</b> |  First you slipped in the shower and broke your arm, and now you've
<b>Floyd</b> | lost your way on a remote "must-see" like  Buwch Island. Then the
<b>Floyd</b> | rain. When you set out on your trip, it was a drizzle. When you
<b>Floyd</b> | realized you took a wrong turn, it was pouring. And, now, as you are
<b>Floyd</b> | back on track, it's a full-blown thunderstorm. Lightning hits the
<b>Floyd</b> | roaring waves in the distance, like screaming giants at war. The wind
<b>Floyd</b> | claws at your face and clothes, making you stagger. The cast doesn't
<b>Floyd</b> | help with that, either.
<b>Floyd</b> | But you promised yourself that you'd  see the famous St. Cafasso
<b>Floyd</b> | lighthouse.  The way back to town is too long now anyway.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You shield your eyes once more and finally see the damned thing, a
<b>Floyd</b> | mile or two in the distance, its light circling the horizon, the only
<b>Floyd</b> | sign of human life in the raging inferno.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Lighthouse
<b>Floyd</b> | An Interactive Fiction by Marius M?ller The release number is 2
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 1 / Serial number 091027 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the road
<b>Floyd</b> | The path has turned into inch-deep mud, and only with the help of the
<b>Floyd</b> | glaringly white lightning can you distinguish it from the soaked
<b>Floyd</b> | meadows all around you. It snakes its way upwards, towards the
<b>Floyd</b> | lighthouse on the cliffs, some miles north.
