						<em>Muggle Studies</em> written by M. Flourish Klink.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Magic is real.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Or that's what the Headmaster of Hogwarts College--no, Hogwarts School
<b>Floyd</b> | of Witchcraft and Wizardry--wants you to think. Assuming that you're
<b>Floyd</b> | not going insane, it seems like he's probably right. How else could you
<b>Floyd</b> | explain the way he appeared out of nowhere, or how he made you speak in
<b>Floyd</b> | rhyming couplets for ten minutes, or how he brought your grandmother's
<b>Floyd</b> | Lladró figurines to life and had them dancing with each other, or
<b>Floyd</b> | packed all your things with the wave of a wand, or...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then, he asked you to be his new Professor of Muggle Studies. Whatever
<b>Floyd</b> | a "Muggle" is. You just needed to sign the contract, say good-bye to
<b>Floyd</b> | your old place, and you'd be whisked away. By magic. To Scotland. To
<b>Floyd</b> | start your new job immediately.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You asked for a little while to think. What you really meant, of
<b>Floyd</b> | course, was "a little while to go on a bender in celebration of all
<b>Floyd</b> | your notions about life and the world being shattered." That worked out
<b>Floyd</b> | pretty well, except you woke up with a pounding headache and a signed
<b>Floyd</b> | contract. Oh, and an old shoe, which apparently you are supposed to
<b>Floyd</b> | touch whenever you want to be transported. You're not sure how that
<b>Floyd</b> | works, but he put it around here somewhere--you can't quite remember
<b>Floyd</b> | where--and you'd better find it if you want to make it to Hogwarts.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A magical contract is probably pretty unbreakable, yeah?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Muggle Studies
<b>Floyd</b> | An exploration of the wonderful world of wizardry, with apologies to
<b>Floyd</b> | J.K. Rowling, by Flourish Klink
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 1 / Serial number 120331 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
<b>Floyd</b> | 6/12N)
<b>Floyd</b> | For more information about the game, or how to play IF, type ABOUT or
<b>Floyd</b> | HELP. For hints on specific puzzles, type HINTS.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your Flat
<b>Floyd</b> | Your simple one-room flat, suitable to the needs of a young teacher.
<b>Floyd</b> | The place was advertised as a steal, and everyone who sees it has to
<b>Floyd</b> | admit that its bones are good. Unfortunately, it hasn't been redone
<b>Floyd</b> | since before the Second World War. Also, it's about the size of a
<b>Floyd</b> | postage stamp. It's cheap, anyway... You've got a bed, a wardrobe, a
<b>Floyd</b> | table, and an ancient Aga to cook on. One lonely broadside hangs on the
<b>Floyd</b> | south wall. The door on the north wall leads to the rest of the
<b>Floyd</b> | building. A packed trunk stands in the middle of the floor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the table are a contract, a Hogwarts brochure, and a handful of
<b>Floyd</b> | yellow Jelly Babies.

<b>Floyd</b> | Dumbledore and Alice Armstrong. Yep. That's your drunk-signature. You'd
<b>Floyd</b> | know it anywhere.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Holy shit. It says that they can erase your memories if you don't
<b>Floyd</b> | actually hold up your end of the deal. It says they can hex you. What

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You read:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY
<b>Floyd</b> | Providing an excellent magical education since 909 AD
<b>Floyd</b> |  Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Order of Merlin First Class, Grand Sorc.,
<b>Floyd</b> | Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump International Confed. of Wizards)--et
<b>Floyd</b> | cetera, et cetera.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ...wait a minute. That's not what the brochure said when Dumbledore
<b>Floyd</b> | gave it to you at your interview. Then, it was about Hogwarts
<b>Floyd</b> | College--not Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry--and it was all
<b>Floyd</b> | about how Hogwarts provides extensive bursaries for nearly all its
<b>Floyd</b> | students, and how they follow a unique educational programme, focusing
<b>Floyd</b> | on life skills and personal interests. And the pictures didn't
<b>Floyd</b> | move--and there certainly wasn't a picture of students flying around on
<b>Floyd</b> | broomsticks--and the section about Hogwarts's history didn't mention
<b>Floyd</b> | that most of the historical alumni still live there as ghosts.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Of course, now that you think about it, it must have been an enchanted
<b>Floyd</b> | brochure. After you accepted the job and Dumbledore broke the news
<b>Floyd</b> | about magic to you, its nature changed. That makes as much sense as
<b>Floyd</b> | anything seems to lately.

<b>Floyd</b> | Owlery
<b>Floyd</b> | You must be in the top of a tall tower; the room is circular, cold, and
<b>Floyd</b> | echoing. Owls swoop in and out of the many unglassed windows. Four
<b>Floyd</b> | perches jut from the walls, high above your head, in each cardinal
<b>Floyd</b> | direction. An owl-parrot seems to have made himself a nest of feathers
<b>Floyd</b> | on the floor. You can also head southwest through a feather-strewn
<b>Floyd</b> | archway. Lots of feathers all over. Wow. Apparently wizards have a
<b>Floyd</b> | thing for birds.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You haven't seen an owl since Grandma died--her house was always ground
<b>Floyd</b> | zero for owls. Day or night, there were always one or two around. She
<b>Floyd</b> | even kept a few mice on hand to feed them, like a normal person would
<b>Floyd</b> | keep birdseed. Kind of bloodthirsty, for an old lady, now that you
<b>Floyd</b> | think about it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you enter, the owl-parrot turns his enormous head to look at you.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Awk. Here for the medallion?" he asks. "Ah--yes?" you respond. "CALL
<b>Floyd</b> | the owls," he says. "Owls are very polite. Owls like names. Four

<b>Floyd</b> | A capacious hall, lit with torches. There's not much here, though,

<b>Floyd</b> | sweeping staircase leads up, and a smaller staircase leads down. A
