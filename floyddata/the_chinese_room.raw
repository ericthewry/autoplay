The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>The Chinese Room</i>, written by Joey Jones and Harry Giles.  <I>The Chinese Room</I> was released as part of the 2007 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took fifth place.  It was nominated for Xyzzies for Best Writing, Best Puzzles, and Best NPCs.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/The_Chinese_Room'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Chinese Room began as an idle thought passing through an idle
<b>Floyd</b> | mind. Giles, recently become interested in the world of contemporary
<b>Floyd</b> | text adventures, restyled as the far classier "interactive fiction",
<b>Floyd</b> | was toying with the idea of his writing his own, and suddenly realised
<b>Floyd</b> | that some of the staples of genre IF -- escaping from a locked room,
<b>Floyd</b> | artificial intelligences, zombies -- were also the staples of the
<b>Floyd</b> | thought experiments of his chosen discipline, philosophy. Suddenly, a
<b>Floyd</b> | concept arrived fully-formed in his head: a text adventure in which
<b>Floyd</b> | the protagonist explored the rich, bizarre and often pointlessly
<b>Floyd</b> | stupid world of philosophy thought experiments.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And that's what this game is. You, a philosophy student, after a night
<b>Floyd</b> | imbibing vast quantities of alcohol, wake up trapped in a malevolent
<b>Floyd</b> | fantasy universe. You must escape. (Assuming you want to, of course.
<b>Floyd</b> | You could just doodle around complaining about the bad jokes.)
<b>Floyd</b> | Essentially, the game is just a vehicle for a lot of jokes, but,
<b>Floyd</b> | taking its insipiration from the revolutionary philosopher Ludwig
<b>Floyd</b> | Wittgenstein ("a serious and good philosophical work could be written
<b>Floyd</b> | entirely of jokes"), it's also designed to serve as a sort of
<b>Floyd</b> | none-too-serious introduction to the world of philosophy. You'll
<b>Floyd</b> | encounter some of the key problems of philosophy in various odd ways,
<b>Floyd</b> | and might even be encouraged to explore them a bit further.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The game was begun in the summer of 06, and then shelved for a frantic
<b>Floyd</b> | academic year in which, amongst other things, Giles discovered he
<b>Floyd</b> | didn't like studying philosophy that much after all. Somewhat more
<b>Floyd</b> | cynical, he returned to IF and the game with an embittered sense of
<b>Floyd</b> | humour. He contacted Jones, an erstwhile beta-tester of the original
<b>Floyd</b> | version of The Chinese Room and asked if he'd be interested in
<b>Floyd</b> | co-authoring. Happily accepting, Jones proceeded to drive the writing
<b>Floyd</b> | forward with surrealistic pace, and after a summer of furious writing,
<b>Floyd</b> | redrafting and testing, the game was completed at the end of summer
<b>Floyd</b> | 07, just in time for the annual Interactive Fiction Competition. Now
<b>Floyd</b> | it's on your screen for you to play. Gosh.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A note about the style of gameplay. This is a very big game, and will
<b>Floyd</b> | probably take a long time to complete. It is possible to die in this
<b>Floyd</b> | game, sometimes suddenly, but usually with warning, and, similarly,
<b>Floyd</b> | while it's possible to trap the game in an unwinnable state, you'll
<b>Floyd</b> | probably be warned you're about to do it. In terms of style, it's
<b>Floyd</b> | heavily-inspired not just by text adventures but also by the LucasArts
<b>Floyd</b> | school of point-and-click adventure games -- irreverent, full of
<b>Floyd</b> | arcane object puzzle quests, and driven forward by a large cast of
<b>Floyd</b> | inane characters. Drawing on early text adventures, it is
<b>Floyd</b> | puzzle-driven rather than plot-driven, so suits being dipped in and
<b>Floyd</b> | out of. This is not a subtle game. This is a silly game. We hope you
<b>Floyd</b> | like it.

<b>Floyd</b> | Hey, folks. How's it going?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game has extensive informative menus. Feel free to read them. If
<b>Floyd</b> | you want to cut the chase and play the game, here's the essential
<b>Floyd</b> | stuff you need to know about what kind of game it is and how it works.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This is a comic adventure set in the fantasy world of philosophy
<b>Floyd</b> | thought experiments. It is designed both as a humorous and enjoyable
<b>Floyd</b> | text adventure in a reasonably traditional style and as an
<b>Floyd</b> | introduction to some of philosophy's key issues, intended to be
<b>Floyd</b> | accessible not only to experienced IF players and experienced
<b>Floyd</b> | philosophers looking for a bit of fun, but also people with very
<b>Floyd</b> | little grounding in either. It is joke- and puzzle-driven, both of
<b>Floyd</b> | which range from the accessible to the tough and in-jokey.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This is a fairly long game, and so may take several play sessions and
<b>Floyd</b> | a number of hours to complete. If for some reason, possibly
<b>Floyd</b> | judging-related, you've got to evaluate it after two hours of play
<b>Floyd</b> | only -- well, that's the way it goes for us over-amibitous writers,
<b>Floyd</b> | sadly. You'll likely not have finished it by then. Sorry about that.
<b>Floyd</b> | We hope you enjoy finishing it later on, when you do have time,
<b>Floyd</b> | though.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is possible to die, though only if you make a mistake, which will
<b>Floyd</b> | usually be clued. Death is often for comic effect, and can be easily
<b>Floyd</b> | undone. In addition, there is a way to trap the game in an unwinnable
<b>Floyd</b> | state, and while you can do this only by being a bit foolhardy, it's
<b>Floyd</b> | probably a good idea to save before doing anything that looks
<b>Floyd</b> | irreversible.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Conversation is menu-based, initiated by the TALK TO command. The one
<b>Floyd</b> | special command is THINK ABOUT &lt;a topic&gt;, which will print some short
<b>Floyd</b> | thoughts on the philosophical topic of your choice. This is designed
<b>Floyd</b> | both to give philosophical background to the jokes and puzzles of the
<b>Floyd</b> | game, and to be a sort of hint system: while none of the game's
<b>Floyd</b> | puzzles require philosophical knowledge, a bit of background might
<b>Floyd</b> | help to jog your intuitions towards the correct solution. You should
<b>Floyd</b> | expect to use THINK ABOUT often, and a complete list of topics is
<b>Floyd</b> | available from the menus.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In addition, there is both a hint system proper, which you should
<b>Floyd</b> | stumble on in your searches in the game (more information in menus),
<b>Floyd</b> | and a Tutorial for play, which walks through the game's opening
<b>Floyd</b> | puzzle. Finally, a walkthrough is available for the length of the
<b>Floyd</b> | IFComp 2007 judging period only: it can be found at
<b>Floyd</b> | www.danglercomic.com/chineseroom.html. We're doing it this roundabout
<b>Floyd</b> | way because neither of us like walkthroughs for various curmudgeonly
<b>Floyd</b> | ideological reasons. If you're using the walkthrough because you're a
<b>Floyd</b> | judge and want to see a lot of the game, that's cool, you're the
<b>Floyd</b> | reason we provided the walkthrough, you may ignore the sarky comments.
<b>Floyd</b> | If you're anybody else, then we hold nothing against you personally,
<b>Floyd</b> | but we seriously suggest you reconsider your policy on walkthroughs.
<b>Floyd</b> | You smelly people.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Right, that's it. Get playing. Hope you enjoy it.

<b>Floyd</b> | sense-data succumb to paralytics.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A few of your lecturers dropped by the Cellar Bar to toast the year
<b>Floyd</b> | with their beleaguered students. Even a couple of the more reclusive

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You fumble with the loose doorknob and slump inside, gingerly pulling

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | The Chinese Room argument is a thought experiment originally devised
<b>Floyd</b> | by John Searle, designed to answer the question (in the negative):
<b>Floyd</b> | "Can a computer ever understand language?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Imagine a computer that has so complete a set of rules for providing
<b>Floyd</b> | Chinese output to Chinese input that it behaves exactly as a human who
<b>Floyd</b> | understands Chinese would. Ask it a question in Chinese, and it will
<b>Floyd</b> | give an appropriate response in Chinese. It appears do "understand"
<b>Floyd</b> | Chinese. But does it?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Imagine now a human living in a small room, who is given a book
<b>Floyd</b> | consisting of a vast set of rules for providing a response in Chinese
<b>Floyd</b> | characters for any information ey receive in Chinese characters. Like
<b>Floyd</b> | a computer ey will provide appropriate Chinese output to Chinese
<b>Floyd</b> | input. The person is analogous to a computer, but does the person
<b>Floyd</b> | understand Chinese? It would seem, intuitively, that ey don't.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The meat of the argument here is to distinguish between syntax, the
<b>Floyd</b> | rules by which language is constructed and manipulated, and semantics,
<b>Floyd</b> | what language actually means, and then claim that even incredibly
<b>Floyd</b> | in-depth knowledge of syntax is not sufficient for semantics -- only
<b>Floyd</b> | human-type minds, and not an artificial intelligence, have the
<b>Floyd</b> | capability to understand meaning.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This leads into the debate about what "meaning" actually means. What
<b>Floyd</b> | can it be that only human-type minds have? What makes us special? Some
<b>Floyd</b> | philosophers, including, perhaps, the creators of the world you now
<b>Floyd</b> | find yourself in, would argue that actually all that the mind's
<b>Floyd</b> | ability to respond to input actually comprises is an incredibly
<b>Floyd</b> | complex set of learned syntactical rules, and that "meaning" separate
<b>Floyd</b> | from this is illusory -- so that if one were to learn all the rules
<b>Floyd</b> | for Chinese language-manipulation, one would understand that language.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | Philosophical zombies, or pzombies, are another common thought
<b>Floyd</b> | experiment in philosophy of mind. They are creations which look and
<b>Floyd</b> | behave in every way like people, but which have no conscious
<b>Floyd</b> | experience. They raise a huge number of questions: are they possible?
<b>Floyd</b> | What is conscious experience? Could a zombie behave like a human
<b>Floyd</b> | without conscious experience? Is conscious experience a physical or
<b>Floyd</b> | non-physical phenomenon?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | These questions lead into what is known as "the hard problem of
<b>Floyd</b> | consciousness", which is: how do we explain subjective (or
<b>Floyd</b> | "phenomenal") conscious experience in terms of its neurological basis?
<b>Floyd</b> | Is the mind separate from the brain, like a free-floating soul? Is the
<b>Floyd</b> | mind a function of the brain, with mental activity caused by brain
<b>Floyd</b> | activity? Is the mind and conscious experience as we understand it an
<b>Floyd</b> | illusion, with the brain no more than the physical? If the mind is
<b>Floyd</b> | caused by the brain, how is it caused, and what is it about the brain
<b>Floyd</b> | that causes it?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The hard problem of consciousness is one of the most perennial
<b>Floyd</b> | problems in philosophy, and in the two decades since it was first
<b>Floyd</b> | formulated by Richard Chalmers we have made little progress. This had
<b>Floyd</b> | led some philosophers, especially postmodern philosophers or followers
<b>Floyd</b> | of Wittgenstein, to wonder whether the problem itself arises only from
<b>Floyd</b> | a sort of language-game, a particular linguistic conception of the
<b>Floyd</b> | mind that has developed over time, especially in the West. Maybe it is
<b>Floyd</b> | not consciousness which is illusory, but rather the existence of the
<b>Floyd</b> | problem of consciousness!

</TD><td></td><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | The Chinese Room argument is a thought experiment originally devised
<b>Floyd</b> | by John Searle, designed to answer the question (in the negative):
<b>Floyd</b> | "Can a computer ever understand language?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Imagine a computer that has so complete a set of rules for providing
<b>Floyd</b> | Chinese output to Chinese input that it behaves exactly as a human who
<b>Floyd</b> | understands Chinese would. Ask it a question in Chinese, and it will
<b>Floyd</b> | give an appropriate response in Chinese. It appears do "understand"
<b>Floyd</b> | Chinese. But does it?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Imagine now a human living in a small room, who is given a book
<b>Floyd</b> | consisting of a vast set of rules for providing a response in Chinese
<b>Floyd</b> | characters for any information ey receive in Chinese characters. Like
<b>Floyd</b> | a computer ey will provide appropriate Chinese output to Chinese
<b>Floyd</b> | input. The person is analogous to a computer, but does the person
<b>Floyd</b> | understand Chinese? It would seem, intuitively, that ey don't.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The meat of the argument here is to distinguish between syntax, the
<b>Floyd</b> | rules by which language is constructed and manipulated, and semantics,
<b>Floyd</b> | what language actually means, and then claim that even incredibly
<b>Floyd</b> | in-depth knowledge of syntax is not sufficient for semantics -- only
<b>Floyd</b> | human-type minds, and not an artificial intelligence, have the
<b>Floyd</b> | capability to understand meaning.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This leads into the debate about what "meaning" actually means. What
<b>Floyd</b> | can it be that only human-type minds have? What makes us special? Some
<b>Floyd</b> | philosophers, including, perhaps, the creators of the world you now
<b>Floyd</b> | find yourself in, would argue that actually all that the mind's
<b>Floyd</b> | ability to respond to input actually comprises is an incredibly
<b>Floyd</b> | complex set of learned syntactical rules, and that "meaning" separate
<b>Floyd</b> | from this is illusory -- so that if one were to learn all the rules
<b>Floyd</b> | for Chinese language-manipulation, one would understand that language.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | The Invisible Pink Unicorn, like the Flying Spaghetti Monster, is a
<b>Floyd</b> | popular satirical religious entity. While their use has now expanded
<b>Floyd</b> | to encompass all manner of religious satire, the original purpose was
<b>Floyd</b> | to point out a common fallacy regarding religious belief and burden of
<b>Floyd</b> | proof.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It has been argued that atheism is an untenable philosophical
<b>Floyd</b> | position, as one cannot give a watertight proof for the non-existence
<b>Floyd</b> | of a religious entity: how would it be possible to prove that a god
<b>Floyd</b> | does not exist? One can only give incomplete arguments in favour of a
<b>Floyd</b> | god's non-existence, and so certain atheism is impossible.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The question asked by the IPU is then, "Well, does that mean that it's
<b>Floyd</b> | perfectly justifiable for me to believe in an invisible pink unicorn
<b>Floyd</b> | orbiting Saturn? No-one's ever seen it, but I believe in it, and it's
<b>Floyd</b> | impossible for you to definitively disprove its existence." Given the
<b>Floyd</b> | intuitive ridiculousness of believing in the IPU without evidence,
<b>Floyd</b> | this response serves to shift the ground of the debate away from
<b>Floyd</b> | requiring atheists to prove an entity's existence with certainty. One
<b>Floyd</b> | implication is that we ought not to be looking for certainty, but
<b>Floyd</b> | rather for good arguments for likely beliefs; another stronger
<b>Floyd</b> | atheistic response is to use this thought experiment to claim that the
<b>Floyd</b> | burden of proof for religious entities lies not with the atheist for
<b>Floyd</b> | disproving existence but rather the believer for proving existence.
<b>Floyd</b> | The question of who holds the burden of proof has become a thorny

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | Examining the scarecrow reveals two rather odd things about it: while
<b>Floyd</b> | acting with at least the appearance a conscious entity, it appears to
<b>Floyd</b> | be operated internally by a horde of homunculi, and operated
<b>Floyd</b> | externally by radio signals from China.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It thus seems to be conflating two thought experiments in philosophy
<b>Floyd</b> | of mind: both Homunculi-Man and China-Brain. Homunculi-Man behaves
<b>Floyd</b> | like an ordinary person, but his brain consists of a huge operating
<b>Floyd</b> | station operated by millions of tiny people replicating the processes
<b>Floyd</b> | of a brain. China-Brain is controlled externally by the entire nation
<b>Floyd</b> | of China, which has organised its people to replicate the functions of
<b>Floyd</b> | the brain: instead of neurones firing, the people of China carry
<b>Floyd</b> | messages to each other and manipulate data, relaying the results in
<b>Floyd</b> | radio signals to the person whose brain is being operated.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Both arguments seek to debunk a position known as "functionalism"
<b>Floyd</b> | which holds that if two things hold the same function, or function in
<b>Floyd</b> | exactly the same way, then they are to all purposes the same thing. In
<b>Floyd</b> | philosophy of mind, this means that if something operates like a mind
<b>Floyd</b> | -- turns the same inputs into the same outputs, then it really is a
<b>Floyd</b> | mind. Homunculi-Man and China-Brain seem to show that something is
<b>Floyd</b> | missing from this picture -- this is usually argued to be
<b>Floyd</b> | "consciousness".
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Consciousness" can come to be thought of as what is missing from
<b>Floyd</b> | China-Brain. What could that be? What is it that we think of the mind
<b>Floyd</b> | as having that we think China-Brain -- or, less wildly, a robot with
<b>Floyd</b> | artificial intelligence -- lacks? The ability to feel? The ability to
<b>Floyd</b> | actually experience the senses subjectively (having "qualia"), rather
<b>Floyd</b> | than simply responding to sensory input? Or is consciousness in this
<b>Floyd</b> | sense illusory? Or is it something else that's missing from the
<b>Floyd</b> | picture of China-Brain?

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Something strange, you realise, has happened to the road. Without you

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Blink. A medieval market village. Blink. A modern cosmpolitan town.
<b>Floyd</b> | Blink. Both at once?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your mind can't fix on a single image of the village. It seems to be
<b>Floyd</b> | every different thing at once, as and when needed. The maid, now in a
<b>Floyd</b> | crisp business suit, carries her wooden water pail into a barber shop,
<b>Floyd</b> | whose red and white striped pole sticks straight out of a dry stone
<b>Floyd</b> | wall. A man in peasant garb emerges from a building with the words

<b>Floyd</b> | A church, a theatre, a tavern, a barbershop, a pavement caf? -- their

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | The Invisible Pink Unicorn, like the Flying Spaghetti Monster, is a
<b>Floyd</b> | popular satirical religious entity. While their use has now expanded
<b>Floyd</b> | to encompass all manner of religious satire, the original purpose was
<b>Floyd</b> | to point out a common fallacy regarding religious belief and burden of
<b>Floyd</b> | proof.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It has been argued that atheism is an untenable philosophical
<b>Floyd</b> | position, as one cannot give a watertight proof for the non-existence
<b>Floyd</b> | of a religious entity: how would it be possible to prove that a god
<b>Floyd</b> | does not exist? One can only give incomplete arguments in favour of a
<b>Floyd</b> | god's non-existence, and so certain atheism is impossible.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The question asked by the IPU is then, "Well, does that mean that it's
<b>Floyd</b> | perfectly justifiable for me to believe in an invisible pink unicorn
<b>Floyd</b> | orbiting Saturn? No-one's ever seen it, but I believe in it, and it's
<b>Floyd</b> | impossible for you to definitively disprove its existence." Given the
<b>Floyd</b> | intuitive ridiculousness of believing in the IPU without evidence,
<b>Floyd</b> | this response serves to shift the ground of the debate away from
<b>Floyd</b> | requiring atheists to prove an entity's existence with certainty. One
<b>Floyd</b> | implication is that we ought not to be looking for certainty, but
<b>Floyd</b> | rather for good arguments for likely beliefs; another stronger
<b>Floyd</b> | atheistic response is to use this thought experiment to claim that the
<b>Floyd</b> | burden of proof for religious entities lies not with the atheist for
<b>Floyd</b> | disproving existence but rather the believer for proving existence.
<b>Floyd</b> | The question of who holds the burden of proof has become a thorny
<b>Floyd</b> | debate.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | The Categorical Imperative is to "Act only according to that maxim
<b>Floyd</b> | whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a
<b>Floyd</b> | universal law." It is the key principle of Kant's deontological
<b>Floyd</b> | ethics, which can't really be summed up, but if they can be, they can
<b>Floyd</b> | be summed up as follows:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In order for acts to be judged on ethical grounds, they must be freely
<b>Floyd</b> | chosen. In order for an act to be freely chosen, it must be rationally
<b>Floyd</b> | chosen, as only rationality liberates us from the brute chains of
<b>Floyd</b> | natural causality. But in order for a choice to be rational, it must
<b>Floyd</b> | be universalisable -- we must be able to imagine that choice being
<b>Floyd</b> | made by everyone in the same situation, without undermining its own
<b>Floyd</b> | foundations. Thus, for example, to put it roughly, we must never
<b>Floyd</b> | steal, because is everyone stole no-one would be able to steal, so the
<b>Floyd</b> | act cannot be rationally undertaken -- it always undermines itself.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | That may not be entirely clear. Like much of Kant's philosophy,
<b>Floyd</b> | deontological ethics are hard to understand, and you're not sure
<b>Floyd</b> | you've remembered your studies properly. One thing sticks in your
<b>Floyd</b> | mind, though: according to Kant, there are no moral dilemmas in
<b>Floyd</b> | deontological ethics as, without having to make any calculations, the
<b>Floyd</b> | proper application of the Categorical Imperative will always determine
<b>Floyd</b> | definitively what is ethical and what is not.

<TR><td></td><TD>smartgenes says (to Floyd), "<font color="#89956F">think about cave</font>"
</TD><td></td><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | The analogy of the cave is one of the earliest and most elegant of
<b>Floyd</b> | philosophical analogies. In it, Plato compares humans to prisoners
<b>Floyd</b> | trapped in a cave, behind whom is an enormous fire, between them and
<b>Floyd</b> | which is a walkway on which pass various people, animals and other
<b>Floyd</b> | things of the world. All the prisoners ever see is the shadow of those
<b>Floyd</b> | things passing along the walkway. The prisoners come to name these
<b>Floyd</b> | shadows, and judge each other by the quality of their naming.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What Plato is trying to imply is that everything we as humans perceive
<b>Floyd</b> | is a representation -- and that all our reasoning is reasoning about
<b>Floyd</b> | these representations. Plato imagines that beyond the world of
<b>Floyd</b> | representations is the world of forms -- ideals of objects. Thus, for
<b>Floyd</b> | example, every philosopher is a pale reflection of the ideal
<b>Floyd</b> | philosopher in the world of forms. Thi idea of the relationship
<b>Floyd</b> | between ideal and representation extends into every discipline of
<b>Floyd</b> | philosophy for Plato -- in aesthetics, for example, we can see the pot
<b>Floyd</b> | a potter makes as a representation of the pot he imagined, which is
<b>Floyd</b> | itself a representation of the ideal pot, and which itself might be
<b>Floyd</b> | represented by a painting of a pot -- each step, for Plato, is a step
<b>Floyd</b> | away from the ideal, and for Plato philosophy became, in a sense, a
<b>Floyd</b> | question for the ideal forms of ideas.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The analogy of the cave continues, however. Imagine a prisoner who is
<b>Floyd</b> | freed and who sees the light of the fire, the sun. He would be blinded
<b>Floyd</b> | by it, completely overcome by his enlightenment. Imagine then that he
<b>Floyd</b> | were forcibly chained down with the rest of the prisoners again. How
<b>Floyd</b> | would he fare in the naming game? Plato suggests that he'd no longer
<b>Floyd</b> | be able to play -- his enlightenment was such that the darkness of the
<b>Floyd</b> | cave would now blind him as well; enlightened, he could no longer
<b>Floyd</b> | dully represent the representation by naming the shadow.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Platonic idealism reverberates throughout Western philosophy -- but
<b>Floyd</b> | this touch on ideas of enlightenment exists also in Eastern
<b>Floyd</b> | philosophy. How are the enlightened to reveal their knowledge to us?
<b>Floyd</b> | How can the enlightened represent the truth? This, perhaps, is the
<b>Floyd</b> | deepest question of philosophy.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | The Ship of Neurath is the term used by W.V.O. Quine in his decription
<b>Floyd</b> | of an analogy by Otto Neurath for his view of the holistic nature of
<b>Floyd</b> | language and scientific verification. Quine wrote, "We are like
<b>Floyd</b> | sailors who on the open sea must reconstruct their ship but are never
<b>Floyd</b> | able to start afresh from the bottom. Where a beam is taken away a new
<b>Floyd</b> | one must at once be put therre, and for this the rest of the ship is
<b>Floyd</b> | used as support. In this way, by using the old beams and driftwood the
<b>Floyd</b> | ship can be shaped entirely anew, but only by gradual reconstruction."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The point being made is that we are never able to start a new system
<b>Floyd</b> | of knowledge (and thus a system of language) from the beginning --
<b>Floyd</b> | what we instead do is replace old known principles which we no longer
<b>Floyd</b> | agree with with new principles, insofar as those new principles can be
<b>Floyd</b> | supported by the rest of the system of knowledge. Perhaps those new
<b>Floyd</b> | principles will weaken another part of the system, which must then
<b>Floyd</b> | itself be removed and replaced. This is Quine's view of how knowledge
<b>Floyd</b> | progresses and language changes -- gradually, by replacing parts of
<b>Floyd</b> | the holistic system, rather than in huge revolutions. One of the most
<b>Floyd</b> | important aspects of this view is its characterisation of knowledge as
<b>Floyd</b> | a holistic system, rather than as a set of disconnected principles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It may or may not be complete coincidence that a strikingly similar
<b>Floyd</b> | analogy, known as the Ship of Theseus, is used for a completely
<b>Floyd</b> | different philosophical problem: that of identity. That's definitely

<b>Floyd</b> | Square
<b>Floyd</b> | The square seems somehow madder now the madman has left.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This appears to be the academic quarter of the village, and so may in
<b>Floyd</b> | fact be a quadrangle, which is awfully exciting. You know it's the
<b>Floyd</b> | academic quarter, because the grass is covered with sprawling young
<b>Floyd</b> | people wearing brightly coloured clothes, dreadlocks, and organic
<b>Floyd</b> | deodorant. Architecturally and geographically speaking, the buildings
<b>Floyd</b> | look like they were placed there by a commitee of village planners
<b>Floyd</b> | whose equipment budget stretched only so far as a compass. Three sides
<b>Floyd</b> | of the square are complemented by a museum, research institute and a
<b>Floyd</b> | library, to the west, north and east respectively.

<b>Floyd</b> | academic quarter, because the grass is covered with sprawling young
<b>Floyd</b> | people wearing brightly coloured clothes, dreadlocks, and organic
<b>Floyd</b> | deodorant. Architecturally and geographically speaking, the buildings
<b>Floyd</b> | look like they were placed there by a commitee of village planners
<b>Floyd</b> | whose equipment budget stretched only so far as a compass. Three sides
<b>Floyd</b> | of the square are complemented by a museum, research institute and a
<b>Floyd</b> | library, to the west, north and east respectively.

<b>Floyd</b> | look like they were placed there by a commitee of village planners

<b>Floyd</b> | You're on a road by the squat concrete hut that contains the Chinese
<b>Floyd</b> | Room. In smooth black tarmac, neatly painted with white lines, the
<b>Floyd</b> | road stretches north to the village in peculiarly perfect tapering
<b>Floyd</b> | perspective. Behind you, to the south, you see the road lead towards
<b>Floyd</b> | some queer-looking hedgerows at the base of the crag. To the east, as
<b>Floyd</b> | before, stretch the plains to the horizon, with the ocean, behind sand
<b>Floyd</b> | dunes, doing likewise to the west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The remains of a scarecrow droop on a pole here.

<b>Floyd</b> | tower six feet above you. The path seems extravagantly narrow, as if
<b>Floyd</b> | the designer wanted to prepare the unwary adventurer from the outside.
<b>Floyd</b> | Above the entrance is a painted wooden sign. It looks important.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | You step tentatively into the maze, looking askance at the lump of
<b>Floyd</b> | lead. Approaching a moral dilemma, it starts whirring wildly, and
<b>Floyd</b> | glowing cracks in the cube appear. It begins to unfold into an
<b>Floyd</b> | astonishingly complex device -- an array of dishes and balances, with
<b>Floyd</b> | an arrow mounted on top. With little else to do you follow the arrow
<b>Floyd</b> | past the dilemma. And then past the next -- and the next. Moral
<b>Floyd</b> | dilemmas seem not to be dilemmas at all before its power, and soon you
<b>Floyd</b> | emerge from the maze, breathless, at the foot of the crag that looms
<b>Floyd</b> | over this land.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A winding path leads up the side of the crag, and you follow it,
<b>Floyd</b> | huffing and puffing, until you reach the top. Here, looming
<b>Floyd</b> | dangerously atop the already looming crag, sits a gigantic loom. No, a
<b>Floyd</b> | gigantic castle -- you were confused for a minute there. Behind you,
<b>Floyd</b> | this crazy world stretches out below. You take a deep breath. You
<b>Floyd</b> | feel, somehow, that you are near your goal -- whatever that may be..
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At the Foot of an Ivory Tower
<b>Floyd</b> | You are in a paved courtyard before the castle. Here, true to form, an
<b>Floyd</b> | ivory tower towers above you, the result of a billion poaching
<b>Floyd</b> | expeditions or more. Similarly true, a guard guards the broad stairs
<b>Floyd</b> | leading up to the tower.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Below you is the vertiginous path down the side of the crag -- and
<b>Floyd</b> | below that stretches the world. The strangest thing of all, however,
<b>Floyd</b> | is the faint and ominous organ music on the periphery of your hearing.

<b>Floyd</b> | Square
<b>Floyd</b> | The square seems somehow madder now the madman has left.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This appears to be the academic quarter of the village, and so may in
<b>Floyd</b> | fact be a quadrangle, which is awfully exciting. You know it's the
<b>Floyd</b> | academic quarter, because the grass is covered with sprawling young
<b>Floyd</b> | people wearing brightly coloured clothes, dreadlocks, and organic
<b>Floyd</b> | deodorant. Architecturally and geographically speaking, the buildings
<b>Floyd</b> | look like they were placed there by a commitee of village planners
<b>Floyd</b> | whose equipment budget stretched only so far as a compass. Three sides
<b>Floyd</b> | of the square are complemented by a museum, research institute and a
<b>Floyd</b> | library, to the west, north and east respectively.

<b>Floyd</b> | With a gleam in your eye, you quickly take your position on the
<b>Floyd</b> | outside lane, just 50 podes ahead of Achilles. When Zeno shouts the
<b>Floyd</b> | go, you pump your legs away without bothering to look behind you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When you've reached about halfway down the track, you hear a curse to
<b>Floyd</b> | Zeus close behind you. Achilles has made a good deal of headway, but
<b>Floyd</b> | something seems to be holding him back. Every time he reaches where

<b>Floyd</b> | progress down towards the flag. For each bound he takes, you manage
<b>Floyd</b> | another bound -- a smaller, humbler bound -- a little further forward.
<b>Floyd</b> | And while you're flagging more than him, and he manages to catch up a
<b>Floyd</b> | little further on each bound, he never quite makes it to you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now it's just a matter of endurance. You set your head towards the

<b>Floyd</b> | coming up just behind you, a gnat's crotchet away -- and you reach the

<b>Floyd</b> | and sink to the ground, exhausted. Achilles throws himself down beside

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A winding path leads up the side of the crag, and you follow it,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At the Foot of an Ivory Tower
<b>Floyd</b> | You are in a paved courtyard before the castle. Here, true to form, an

<b>Floyd</b> | leading up to the tower.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Below you is the vertiginous path down the side of the crag -- and

</TD><td></td><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | "Ding an sich" is Kant's German term meaning "the thing in itself". A
<b>Floyd</b> | thing in itself is something independent of awareness -- it is core to
<b>Floyd</b> | Kant's philosophy that we live in a world of appearances, the
<b>Floyd</b> | appearances created by a discursive mind which shapes them according
<b>Floyd</b> | to its own innate mental categories, but that "beneath" this world of
<b>Floyd</b> | appearances lies the world in itself, about which we can know nothing
<b>Floyd</b> | but that it exists.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This distinction, also known as that between "phenomena" and
<b>Floyd</b> | "noumena", has been enormously influential. In epistemology, it
<b>Floyd</b> | overturned the rationalist/empiricist debate, by implying that we can
<b>Floyd</b> | only know the empirical world (and not the ideal truths of
<b>Floyd</b> | rationalism), but also by adding that we must know that empirical
<b>Floyd</b> | world rationally. The idea that there is a world of subjective
<b>Floyd</b> | awareness fed into later debates in philosophy of mind, while the idea
<b>Floyd</b> | that the world of appearances is discursively created led the way for
<b>Floyd</b> | the postmodern and post-structuralist revolution in philosophy, which
<b>Floyd</b> | dismantled philosophical dogmas and preconceptions as being culturally
<b>Floyd</b> | and linguistically specific, and which implied that all knowledge is
<b>Floyd</b> | to some extent chosen, discursively determined by interpreting minds.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | That revolution, as well as more analytic attacks on Kant's
<b>Floyd</b> | philosophy, has served to help undermine the phenomenal/noumenal
<b>Floyd</b> | distinction in the first place. Is there really a world of appearances
<b>Floyd</b> | present in consciousness? Is there really a world in itself
<b>Floyd</b> | independent of experience? These questions are the foundation of
<b>Floyd</b> | metaphysics to this day.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | The Evil Demon rules over Western philosophy. He is one of the first
<b>Floyd</b> | thought experiments in its Modern period, devised by Descartes, the
<b>Floyd</b> | Father of Modern Philosophy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Descartes set out to determine what he could know using only the
<b>Floyd</b> | powers of his own rationality. He reasoned thus: there could be an
<b>Floyd</b> | Evil Demon controlling every aspect of my experience. Everything I
<b>Floyd</b> | think I know could be a false impression created by an Evil Demon to
<b>Floyd</b> | fool me. So what can I know by the use of reason alone? Descartes's
<b>Floyd</b> | first thought was that he knew with utter certainty that we was
<b>Floyd</b> | thinking -- for even if he only thought he was thinking, even if the
<b>Floyd</b> | Evil Demon was fooling him into thinking, that was still a thought. He
<b>Floyd</b> | could not doubt he was thinking, because doubt was a thought. So he
<b>Floyd</b> | was thinking. Cogito, ergo sum -- popularly translated as "I think,
<b>Floyd</b> | therefore I am".
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Descartes continued to think a lot more than that, but perhaps you'd
<b>Floyd</b> | better just think about this for a moment. First thought: this
<b>Floyd</b> | devision of what we reason and what we experience has ruled over much
<b>Floyd</b> | of Western philosophy. But why is reason more certain than experience?
<b>Floyd</b> | Couldn't the Evil Demon fool us into thinking that we were certain of
<b>Floyd</b> | our rationality as well? Couldn't we just as well think that direct
<b>Floyd</b> | experience, sitting safe in memory, is more reliable than waffly
<b>Floyd</b> | rationality? Second thought: how does Descartes get from the neat
<b>Floyd</b> | proof that he is thinking to the idea that he definitely exists? What
<b>Floyd</b> | about thought proves existence? Isn't just the humbler "Cogito" by
<b>Floyd</b> | itself better? Third thought: What do we mean by thoughts?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There are huge questions even at the very root of the founding ideas
<b>Floyd</b> | of our philosophy.
