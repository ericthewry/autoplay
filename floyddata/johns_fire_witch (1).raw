The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>John's Fire Witch</i>, written by John&nbsp;T.&nbsp;Baker&nbsp;II.  <i>John's Fire Witch</i> was originally released in 1995.  It was released prior to the first IF Competition, in a time when the concept of shorter games was still novel.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/88"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.</br>

</br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing these games, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played these games, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's a cold weekend in December of 1990, and it's been far too long
<b>Floyd</b> | since you have seen your friend John Baker!  But you've finally managed
<b>Floyd</b> | to take some time out of your schedule to drive to Columbus and spend
<b>Floyd</b> | some "quality time" together.  Quality time, of course, means that you

<b>Floyd</b> | and he are going to sample every bar that Ohio State University's High
<b>Floyd</b> | Street has to offer.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | John was to meet you at a favorite pizza and beer spot to start off the
<b>Floyd</b> | evening, but he hasn't showed up.  John's always been rather
<b>Floyd</b> | spontaneous (read that as 'erratic'), so you think he'll show up

<b>Floyd</b> | eventually.  But as the night wears on and you tire of downing beers by
<b>Floyd</b> | yourself, you decide to drive to his place and see if he's left a note
<b>Floyd</b> | or something for you there.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You find his front door unlocked and John nowhere to be found.  Pretty
<b>Floyd</b> | tired from your earlier drive, and also buzzing a bit from the beer you

<b>Floyd</b> | drank, you quickly doze off in the living room.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is now morning.  A terrible snow storm is raging outside, the worst
<b>Floyd</b> | you've ever seen.  You can't believe how much snow has piled up over
<b>Floyd</b> | the night.  You still haven't heard from John, and you seem to now be
<b>Floyd</b> | trapped in his apartment.

<b>Floyd</b> | It's a cold weekend in December of 1990, and it's been far too long
<b>Floyd</b> | since you have seen your friend John Baker!  But you've finally managed
<b>Floyd</b> | to take some time out of your schedule to drive to Columbus and spend

<b>Floyd</b> | and he are going to sample every bar that Ohio State University's High
<b>Floyd</b> | Street has to offer.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | John was to meet you at a favorite pizza and beer spot to start off the
<b>Floyd</b> | evening, but he hasn't showed up.  John's always been rather
<b>Floyd</b> | spontaneous (read that as 'erratic'), so you think he'll show up
<b>Floyd</b> | eventually.  But as the night wears on and you tire of downing beers by
<b>Floyd</b> | yourself, you decide to drive to his place and see if he's left a note

<b>Floyd</b> | or something for you there.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You find his front door unlocked and John nowhere to be found.  Pretty
<b>Floyd</b> | tired from your earlier drive, and also buzzing a bit from the beer you
<b>Floyd</b> | drank, you quickly doze off in the living room.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | It is now morning.  A terrible snow storm is raging outside, the worst
<b>Floyd</b> | you've ever seen.  You can't believe how much snow has piled up over
<b>Floyd</b> | the night.  You still haven't heard from John, and you seem to now be
<b>Floyd</b> | trapped in his apartment.
