The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Earth and Sky</i>, written by Paul&nbsp;O'Brian.  <i>Earth and Sky</i> was originally released as part of the 2001 IF Competition, where it took eighth place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Earth_and_Sky"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

</br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | But for you it's as if the ground beneath your feet stopped existing,

<b>Floyd</b> | even sorting through Mom and Dad's lab in hopes of finding an answer.

<b>Floyd</b> | exception of its conversation system. This system is a mad scientist's

<b>Floyd</b> | hybrid of various techniques from other games:
<b>Floyd</b> |    * ASK &lt;character&gt; ABOUT &lt;topic&gt; and TELL &lt;character&gt; ABOUT &lt;topic&gt;

<b>Floyd</b> | are enabled, and can be used to interact with any non-player character
<b>Floyd</b> | (NPC).
<b>Floyd</b> |    * However, when an NPC addresses the player character (PC), EARTH
<b>Floyd</b> | AND SKY will present a list of possible replies, and ask the player to
<b>Floyd</b> | select one of these. (Remaining silent is always an option as well.)
<b>Floyd</b> |    * Finally, if the player would rather move along with the story

<b>Floyd</b> | than grill NPCs, the verb TALK TO &lt;npc&gt; is also available. Selecting
<b>Floyd</b> | this verb will prompt EARTH AND SKY to launch an entire dialogue
<b>Floyd</b> | between the PC and the NPC, each of whom will choose their words and
<b>Floyd</b> | topics based on what's currently happening in the game.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | EARTH AND SKY is designed so that it cannot be put into an unwinnable
<b>Floyd</b> | state.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Note to PalmPilot users: For best results, play Earth And Sky with a
<b>Floyd</b> | 40-column-width screen. To set this under Frobnitz, access the menus
<b>Floyd</b> | (by tapping the menu button in the bottom left corner of the green

<b>Floyd</b> | lower window) then tap Options, Configure Display, and set Columns to
<b>Floyd</b> | 40. Then restart the game.

<b>Floyd</b> | Monastersky -- he wrote an article in the Oct. 19, 2000 edition of the
<b>Floyd</b> | Chronicle of Higher Education about West Chester University's research

<b>Floyd</b> | into isolating ancient bacteria, and that piece directly inspired much
<b>Floyd</b> | of part two. Apologies and thanks as well to Drs. Vreeland et. al. for
<b>Floyd</b> | the liberties I've taken with their work.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Without the support of my family, this work would probably never have
<b>Floyd</b> | been started, let alone finished. A thousand thanks to them.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | EARTH AND SKY is an affectionate tribute to the creators of Marvel
<b>Floyd</b> | Comics, whose dazzling imaginations have illuminated my childhood and

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And saving the best for last: extra-special thanks to David, Jenny,

<b>Floyd</b> | Jon, and Stephen, my outstanding cadre of betatesters. Way to save my

<b>Floyd</b> | Lab
<b>Floyd</b> | Ever since Dad got shortlisted for the Nobel in physics and Mom's
<b>Floyd</b> | patents started making millions, the University has pretty much given
<b>Floyd</b> | them carte blanche. Consequently, this lab space is cavernous, tens of
<b>Floyd</b> | thousands of square feet, with ceilings reaching nearly five stories
<b>Floyd</b> | high. Some parts of this giant room are occupied by giant equipment,

<b>Floyd</b> | dizzyingly complex hunks of machinery at whose function you couldn't
<b>Floyd</b> | even begin to guess. Other parts are empty, save for a few tables and
<b>Floyd</b> | terminals. A ring of windows near the ceiling looks out on the distant
<b>Floyd</b> | stars. Doors lead south into the storage room and west into the
<b>Floyd</b> | hallway.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You look around for Austin, but he's not here. Typical. Well, knowing
<b>Floyd</b> | your perpetually late brother, he'll be along soon enough.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Amidst the general chaos of the lab, a legal pad seems to have fallen

<b>Floyd</b> | was hoping for. All I know is that nobody seems to know what happened

<b>Floyd</b> | have disappeared. So I've been combing through the lab, trying to
<b>Floyd</b> | reconstruct what they were working on at the time it happened."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He leans back against a towering piece of steel machinery, allowing
<b>Floyd</b> | himself to slide down it and sit on the floor. "They were working on a
<b>Floyd</b> | lot, Em, let me tell you -- most of it so far beyond my own scientific
<b>Floyd</b> | experience that it took me a long time to even grasp the point of each
<b>Floyd</b> | experiment. Dad's cryptic notation style didn't help much either. So

<b>Floyd</b> | last night, when I started checking out a piece of equipment that
<b>Floyd</b> | didn't seem to have any purpose at all, I figured it was just my own
<b>Floyd</b> | ignorance again, that I didn't know what the thing was. Then I
<b>Floyd</b> | stumbled on a tiny little latch, and the whole thing swung open. Em,
<b>Floyd</b> | it was hollow inside. And stuffed into that cavity were these suits,
<b>Floyd</b> | with this notebook."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He opens the notebook and begins to read aloud:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Earthsuit: provides
<b>Floyd</b> |       * greatly enhanced strength
<b>Floyd</b> |       * resistance to electric shock

<b>Floyd</b> |       * invulnerability to impact (nearly)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Must be Mom's notes, you think to yourself. Dad would've written

<b>Floyd</b> |    Skysuit: provides
<b>Floyd</b> |       * flight
<b>Floyd</b> |       * electrical discharges (blasts)
<b>Floyd</b> |       * fog

<b>Floyd</b> | Austin turns around to face the device he had been using as a

<b>Floyd</b> | It's hard to imagine how Nina Icolari ever became friends with your
<b>Floyd</b> | parents. Where they are serious and straightforward, even to the point
<b>Floyd</b> | of stuffiness, she's fun-loving and mischievous. Mom and Dad are night
<b>Floyd</b> | owls, while Nina works best early in the morning. Your parents drink
<b>Floyd</b> | Coke, she drinks Pepsi, and so on. But all those differences vanish
<b>Floyd</b> | inside the lab, where your goofy Aunt Nina suddenly metamorphoses into

<b>Floyd</b> | a world-class biologist, a driven scientist doing some of the most
<b>Floyd</b> | cutting-edge research in the field. When she's working, it's almost
<b>Floyd</b> | impossible to distract her with anything else, which makes your task
<b>Floyd</b> | today a difficult one...
