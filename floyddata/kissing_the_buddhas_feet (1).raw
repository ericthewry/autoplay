The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Kissing the Buddha's Feet</i>, written by Leon&nbsp;Lin.  <i>Kissing the Buddha's Feet</i> was originally released as part of the 1996 IF Competition, where it took fifth place.  It received Xyzzy nominations--and ultimately won--for Best Individual NPC and Best NPCs.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/120"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.</br>

So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> |    "I've actually done it," announces John as he enters the bathroom.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Done what?"  you say, trying to ignore him as you scrub the
<b>Floyd</b> | bathtub.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    John pulls out a sheet of crumpled paper and a lighter and sets the
<b>Floyd</b> | paper ablaze.  "My drop form," he says, looking at the paper.  "I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | not failing Psych 1 this semester.  I'm going to ace the final!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Surprised, you slip on your scouring pad and nearly fall face first

<b>Floyd</b> | into the tub.  "*What*?  You're actually going to *finish* that
<b>Floyd</b> | class?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Definitely!"  exclaims John, his face growing hard with
<b>Floyd</b> | determination, a determination you've never before seen on him.  "I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | tired of bombing that class!  I know I can pass this time!  I don't

<b>Floyd</b> | care if I've got a D minus in it so far!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    For the last two years, you and John have shared a tiny apartment
<b>Floyd</b> | north of campus.  It didn't take long to find out that you and John
<b>Floyd</b> | were, so to speak, "incompatible."  As you couldn't find another
<b>Floyd</b> | apartment, you've been praying for release ever since, if not by

<b>Floyd</b> | death, at least by John's graduating and leaving.  Because John has
<b>Floyd</b> | consistently failed Psych 1 for the last six years, it looked as if
<b>Floyd</b> | you'd be stuck with him in this hell hole for the rest of your college
<b>Floyd</b> | life.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    But now it looks as though you might get your reprieve.  If John

<b>Floyd</b> | only *passes* tomorrow's final, scheduled at eight o'clock, you'll be
<b>Floyd</b> | home free.  But John is easily distracted, and has lots of boisterous,
<b>Floyd</b> | noisy friends who like to drop in at inopportune moments.  You've got
<b>Floyd</b> | to make sure John gets enough quality time to study.  Tonight, the two
<b>Floyd</b> | of you will be pulling an all-nighter, burning the midnight oil, and

<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    This is the living room of your apartment.  Well, at least half of
<b>Floyd</b> | it *could* be called a living room, in the sense that a person could
<b>Floyd</b> | actually live in it.  You and John have long since decided that you
<b>Floyd</b> | would split the room into two, and each be responsible for each one's
<b>Floyd</b> | designated half.  Your half, which contains a tasteful paisley couch

<b>Floyd</b> | and mahogany table, looks bright and clean.  John's half, on the other
<b>Floyd</b> | hand, has piles of newspaper and beer cans, a ratty sofa which bleeds
<b>Floyd</b> | foam, and a study desk and chair, neither of which have seen much
<b>Floyd</b> | action until the last three days.  The center of the room contains
<b>Floyd</b> | items you have both consented to share, such as the TV set, which is
<b>Floyd</b> | currently on.

<b>Floyd</b> |    The kitchen is to the west, the bedrooms and bath to the east, and
<b>Floyd</b> | the exit (through which you hope to see John go soon) to the north.
<b>Floyd</b> |    John is here, sitting at his special studying desk, trying
<b>Floyd</b> | desperately to read his psychology textbook.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Kissing the Buddha's Feet" was an entry in the Second Annual

<b>Floyd</b> | Interactive Fiction Competition.  It placed fifth overall in a field
<b>Floyd</b> | of 27 entries, and later won two XYZZY awards (Best Individual NPC and
<b>Floyd</b> | Best NPCs).  Version 1.1 is essentially the same as the game that was
<b>Floyd</b> | submitted to the competition, except for a few bug fixes and cosmetic
<b>Floyd</b> | changes; these changes are outlined in the file bugfix.txt which
<b>Floyd</b> | should have come with the game package.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game is freeware (though not public domain), and may be freely
<b>Floyd</b> | played, copied, and distributed provided that you:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 1) Don't sell it for a profit.  You may charge a fee to cover the cost
<b>Floyd</b> | of any media you distribute the game on but no more.

<b>Floyd</b> | 2) Don't modify the game.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I appreciate any comments, criticism, and bug reports you send me.
<b>Floyd</b> | You can reach me by e-mail at leonlin@uclink.berkeley.edu.  This
<b>Floyd</b> | address should be valid at least until the end of 1997.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks, and enjoy the game!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
<b>Floyd</b> | ----------------
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks to Kevin Wilson for his advice and help.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks also to this competition's Internet Beta-Testing team,
<b>Floyd</b> | particularly Michael Kinyon, who helped me find bugs and other
<b>Floyd</b> | annoying oddities in my game I probably would have never discovered on
<b>Floyd</b> | my own.  And many thanks to those who wrote to me after the
<b>Floyd</b> | competition to inform about bugs they had discovered.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Many thanks as well to the many people who wrote reviews and comments
<b>Floyd</b> | about this game, as well as my previous game, "The One That Got
<b>Floyd</b> | Away"--such criticism has helped me improve and grow as an author of
<b>Floyd</b> | interactive fiction.  Thanks also to all of the people whose votes in
<b>Floyd</b> | the 1996 Interactive Fiction Competition and the XYZZY Awards helped

<b>Floyd</b> | this game receive the recognition that it did.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And finally, thanks to my parents, who have given me their love and
<b>Floyd</b> | support.  This game wouldn't have been possible without them.

<b>Floyd</b> | Like your room, John's room has a bed, dresser, desk, and an open
<b>Floyd</b> | closet door to the east.  Unlike your room, it is quite disorganized,
<b>Floyd</b> | to say the least.  Sheets are spread all over the room and clothes, as
<b>Floyd</b> | well as less-speakable debris, are strewn about, giving the room a
<b>Floyd</b> | ripe, musty odor not unlike rotting fruit in an ancient tomb; broken
<b>Floyd</b> | plastic models litter the scarred desk.  Set in the north wall is an

<b>Floyd</b> | open window to the outside world.  There is a (fortunately) open door
<b>Floyd</b> | to the south.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    John is fairly nonchalant about you going into his room and using

<b>Floyd</b> | Like your room, John's room has a bed, dresser, desk, and an open

<b>Floyd</b> | to say the least.  Sheets are spread all over the room and clothes, as
<b>Floyd</b> | well as less-speakable debris, are strewn about, giving the room a
<b>Floyd</b> | ripe, musty odor not unlike rotting fruit in an ancient tomb; broken
<b>Floyd</b> | plastic models litter the scarred desk.  Set in the north wall is a

<b>Floyd</b> |     "I did it!"  yells John hours later, as he arrives home
<b>Floyd</b> | triumphantly with the exam, graded "D+."  You feel a strong sense of
<b>Floyd</b> | relief as you collapse onto your beloved paisley couch.  Finally!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    In three weeks, John receives his degree, and promptly moves out.
<b>Floyd</b> | He shakes your hand before leaving, saying, "I couldn't have done it

<b>Floyd</b> | without you, man.  I owe you a lot.  I hope it isn't too lonely here
<b>Floyd</b> | without me.  It's like we've become such good friends over the years,
<b>Floyd</b> | and now we have to part."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Isn't there a plane you have to catch...I mean, I'll miss you
<b>Floyd</b> | too," you say.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    And so, life alone begins.  The rent is more expensive now that
<b>Floyd</b> | you're living alone, but the whole apartment is cleaner and quieter,
<b>Floyd</b> | and you can now relax and enjoy yourself.
