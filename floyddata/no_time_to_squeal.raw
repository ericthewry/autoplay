					<span class="fontish smaller">Like ClubFloyd, the idea behind NightFloyd is that a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.<br><br>Unlike ClubFloyd, NightFloyd often takes on significantly larger works of interactive fiction, knowing going in that each one will take multiple sessions (but not always, as you'll see in this transcript). NightFloyd is also a bit more informal than ClubFloyd in that it's only announced on the ifMUD #clubfloyd bulletin board, and the time shifts around to meet player's schedules far more than ClubFloyd does. NightFloyd is organized by genericgeekgirl, aka Adri.<br>

						<em>No Time to Squeal</em> written by Mike Sousa and Robb Sherwin.
						<I>No Time to Squeal</I> was released as part of the 2001 Interactive Fiction Competition, in which it took fourth place. It went on to be nominated for a Xyzzy for Best Writing.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    What sucks, about being the pro agent for a sociopathic defensive
<b>Floyd</b> | tackle like Tavarian Pittman, is the never-ending, ulcer-inducing,
<b>Floyd</b> | cloud of dark dread that seems to follow him and those that associate
<b>Floyd</b> | with him.  Tavarian is a chiseled 6'4", 313lb athletic monster -- he
<b>Floyd</b> | can run the 40 yard dash in 4.33 seconds, and can throw opposing
<b>Floyd</b> | players around the football field with ease.  While playing, he is a
<b>Floyd</b> | whirling dervish of rage.  Unfortunately, Tavarian displays that same
<b>Floyd</b> | kind of restraint in everyday life.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Four months ago, he celebrated winning an award at the Nokia Sugar
<b>Floyd</b> | Bowl by crashing an off-campus party and proceeded to get roaring drunk
<b>Floyd</b> | with his friends.  It was a theme party -- a pre-med student hosting it
<b>Floyd</b> | had a cadaver on display as the party's centerpiece.  After drinking
<b>Floyd</b> | himself into an almost criminal level of intoxication, Tavarian and his
<b>Floyd</b> | friends started throwing the corpse around the house as if it were an
<b>Floyd</b> | old softball.  Tavarian punched a hole through the back of the thing's
<b>Floyd</b> | neck and started a ventriloquist act in extremely poor taste.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    An attending film studies student had brought his camcorder with him
<b>Floyd</b> | and recorded the entire thing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    It made national headlines: Tavarian was called out by sports
<b>Floyd</b> | writers everywhere, denounced as an archdemon, and the summation of
<b>Floyd</b> | What's Wrong With Collegiate Sports.  His nickname soon became 'The
<b>Floyd</b> | Ripper' when one beat writer wondered if his next act was in writing
<b>Floyd</b> | "Dear Boss" letters to the local paper. Tavarian had already declared
<b>Floyd</b> | for the NFL Pro Draft, so he had no option of returning to school and
<b>Floyd</b> | laying low until the incident blew over.  He was likely to go
<b>Floyd</b> | completely undrafted, as no professional team could afford the PR hit
<b>Floyd</b> | they would take by selecting him.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You'd been trying to make it on your own as a sports agent for a
<b>Floyd</b> | while now.  You love the independence of being your own boss, you'd
<b>Floyd</b> | always loved sports and you wanted to be able to provide an affluent
<b>Floyd</b> | living for your wife and the baby that was on the way... but it hasn't
<b>Floyd</b> | been easy.  Becoming successful on your own has been a complete
<b>Floyd</b> | Catch-22 -- you need to sign a high-profile client in order to make any
<b>Floyd</b> | real money, but no normal athlete wants to risk being your first big
<b>Floyd</b> | contract.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Tavarian was looking for an agent when you met him while scouting a
<b>Floyd</b> | winter baseball game a few months back.  You had managed to win a huge
<b>Floyd</b> | arbitration case for the backup shortstop on the Red Sox -- no small
<b>Floyd</b> | prize, considering the perennial all-star he plays behind -- and you
<b>Floyd</b> | started to generate whispers that perhaps you had a talent for working
<b>Floyd</b> | miracles.  Tavarian, who was in need of one, introduced both himself
<b>Floyd</b> | and his girlfriend Theresa during the game.  You in turn introduced
<b>Floyd</b> | your wife, Charlise.  Both girls were five months pregnant with their
<b>Floyd</b> | first child and they completely hit it off.  Charlise practically sold
<b>Floyd</b> | you herself, painting a glorious picture of how hard you work and what
<b>Floyd</b> | a good soul you are -- essentially depicting you in the kind, glowing
<b>Floyd</b> | terms that she sees you with everyday.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Tavarian expressed to you his desire to turn his life around and get
<b>Floyd</b> | drafted by an NFL team in April, and ultimately hired you that day.
<b>Floyd</b> | Since then you have been working the circuit, trying to bend the ear of
<b>Floyd</b> | the 32 NFL general managers.  It hasn't been easy -- being away from
<b>Floyd</b> | your wife for most of the time has been excruciating, really -- and it
<b>Floyd</b> | didn't help when Tavarian spent a night in jail after going berserk on
<b>Floyd</b> | some pizza delivery guy while Theresa was visiting her parents... but
<b>Floyd</b> | with a calming influence around him 24/7 ever since, there have been no
<b>Floyd</b> | other problems.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Really, he doesn't seem to be the psychotic harbinger of death that
<b>Floyd</b> | the media has painted him out to be.  Not when you really get to know
<b>Floyd</b> | him.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Golf Course
<b>Floyd</b> |    You're on the golf course with the general manager of the New
<b>Floyd</b> | England Patriots.  The meeting is going well, so far, but your mind is
<b>Floyd</b> | really with Charlise, who is now nine months pregnant and due any day
<b>Floyd</b> | now.  Funnily enough, even in your semi-distracted state, this is the
<b>Floyd</b> | first team you've made progress with.  It's a good fit -- they see you
<b>Floyd</b> | as a local boy who can be trusted, and they have some serious defensive
<b>Floyd</b> | issues they could solve with Pittman.  The Patriots are picking
<b>Floyd</b> | twenty-third, and have a history of not being overly concerned with
<b>Floyd</b> | drafting or signing guys with... well, with some question marks.
<b>Floyd</b> | Katzenmoyer, Peter, Meggett, Mowatt -- it's not exactly like
<b>Floyd</b> | quarterback Donny Osmond handing off to halfback Marie.  If you can
<b>Floyd</b> | just convince them to meet Tavarian... then, provided he just acts like
<b>Floyd</b> | himself, he's at least got the opportunity to charm them.  Maybe they
<b>Floyd</b> | don't take him in the first round, but even if he is taken in the
<b>Floyd</b> | second or third it would be a great day for him, *considering* and all,
<b>Floyd</b> | and a major success for yourself.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Dan Fonda, the general manager of the Patriots, is here with you.  He's
<b>Floyd</b> | up two strokes on you, but is heading for a triple-bogey on this hole.
<b>Floyd</b> | The other two guys in the foursome -- director of Player Development
<b>Floyd</b> | Terry O'Hare and current player Bucky Johnson, are a dozen strokes
<b>Floyd</b> | behind you two.  You can probably get it into the cup in two strokes
<b>Floyd</b> | from here, and win the match outright.  Or, should you slice, hook or
<b>Floyd</b> | just outright shank it, you'll ensure that Fonda wins.  He seems
<b>Floyd</b> | earnest and sincere, and the kind of guy who wouldn't catch on if you
<b>Floyd</b> | let him win.  But then, he might be the kind of guy who doesn't respect
<b>Floyd</b> | someone who can't "beat" him on the greens.  Just which you're not sure
<b>Floyd</b> | of, yet.

<b>Floyd</b> | Another enormously hectic day at the Saint Columbia Veteran's Hospital,
<b>Floyd</b> | but hectic in a good way -- there's a palatable energy in the air with
<b>Floyd</b> | the recent flood of newborns and the successful bypass surgery of a
<b>Floyd</b> | minor (although, incredibly talented and quite gracious) celebrity
<b>Floyd</b> | having been recently completed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your friend -- and fellow nurse -- Jessica has been talking up a
<b>Floyd</b> | double-blind date that the two of you are to be going on this weekend,
<b>Floyd</b> | which will at least be interesting if nothing else.  Last time the two
<b>Floyd</b> | of you tried this, she found a couple guys from an Internet Go Server.
<b>Floyd</b> | While they were definitely amusing, (and definitely available) they
<b>Floyd</b> | were a little too preoccupied with moving stones around a monitor
<b>Floyd</b> | screen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Trying to get them out of the house again proved to be almost
<b>Floyd</b> | excruciatingly difficult.  So Jess has things planned with some other
<b>Floyd</b> | guys she met over Relay Chat.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "They are into something," Jess said, "called Magic: The Gathering.
<b>Floyd</b> | See?  That implies that they are into social get-togethers and
<b>Floyd</b> | gatherings.  It's all been taken care of.  Plus, they sent me gifs of
<b>Floyd</b> | themselves and they have that David Copperfield meets Harry Houdini
<b>Floyd</b> | thing going on, as all magicians do.  Trust me!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Well, you seem to recall something about that being a card game, but
<b>Floyd</b> | why not give her the benefit of the doubt?  It's good to get out and
<b>Floyd</b> | mix things up socially again, especially since the last creep you dated
<b>Floyd</b> | finally got the message and stopped coming around the hospital.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can't help but notice the clock -- 1:17pm.  Still another thirteen
<b>Floyd</b> | minutes left of this break.  Excellent.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You study the fetal monitor.

<b>Floyd</b> | Your face goes white.  The husband stops in mid-sentence.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After getting to the intercom, you send out a page:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Dr. McKinney, I need you in LDR 14 STAT, paging Dr. McKinney, LDR 14
<b>Floyd</b> | STAT!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The husband looks confused and alarmed, but you have work to do.  You
<b>Floyd</b> | take his wife's blood pressure, temperature and heart rate.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "We're going to need to get to the OR," you tell the husband, softly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Dr. McKinney does his best to save the little girl.  The poor baby had
<b>Floyd</b> | a nucal cord -- they're just so damn hard to predict.  You head over to
<b>Floyd</b> | the OR table to see if CPR can save a life, but before you arrive, you
<b>Floyd</b> | stop dead in your tracks as you watch the father's face fill with
<b>Floyd</b> | horror.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You overhear a bit of the conversation between the doctor and his
<b>Floyd</b> | assistants.  It doesn't sound good, it doesn't sound like the baby made
<b>Floyd</b> | it...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The doctor shakes his head and leaves the operating table.  You can
<b>Floyd</b> | tell from the manner in which he carries himself that the baby didn't
<b>Floyd</b> | make it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He passes you, just a shell of his regular self.  This is the first
<b>Floyd</b> | time you've seen him like this -- he's usually a bastion of security
<b>Floyd</b> | and success.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Dr. McKinney goes to break the news to Kieron, the woman's husband.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You leave the Operating Room.  You wander back over to the break room
<b>Floyd</b> | to pick up your stuff.  Jessica meets you half-way there.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Did you hear yet?"  she says.  "Freddie's on the news.  They've got a

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I don't really want to hear about Freddie right now," you say.

<b>Floyd</b> | "What's wrong?"

<b>Floyd</b> | "The baby, the baby from LDR 14, you know, that couple?"

<b>Floyd</b> | No Time To Squeal
<b>Floyd</b> | Interactive Fiction
<b>Floyd</b> | Copyright (c) 2001.  Written and programmed by Mike Sousa and Robb
<b>Floyd</b> | Sherwin
<b>Floyd</b> | (First-time players should type HELP)
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 1.0 / Serial number 092801 / TADS 2.55
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Alley
<b>Floyd</b> |    A filthy place, mongrels and predators scurry and skulk about the
<b>Floyd</b> | edges of your vision, seemingly self-satisfied in their hidden snark
<b>Floyd</b> | just beyond your focus.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The alley wall behind you rises until it seems that you shall never
<b>Floyd</b> | grow tall enough to surpass it.  It melts away in its own acclivity,
<b>Floyd</b> | merging into a starless night.  Walls to both sides reflect a build of
<b>Floyd</b> | age and accompanying deterioration.  Your skin crawls with the
<b>Floyd</b> | sensations of spying from some things, some group of denizens choosing
<b>Floyd</b> | themselves to be, as of yet, unrevealed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Fogging spoils your far sight to the west, while it reveals your sole
<b>Floyd</b> | path for this continued evening venture.
