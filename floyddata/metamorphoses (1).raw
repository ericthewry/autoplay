The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Metamorphoses</i>, written by Emily&nbsp;Short.  <i>Metamorphoses</i> was originally released as part of the 2000 IF Competition, where it took second place. It received Xyzzy nominations for Best Writing, Best Setting, Best Puzzles, and Best Use of Medium, and ultimately won the Xyzzy for Best Writing.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/910"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.</br>

</br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

</TD><td></td><td></td></TR>

</TD><td></td><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD><b>Jacqueline</b> says, "So the way it works, ls, is like this.  Once we start (at the top of the hour), we restrict our chatter to the #clubfloyd channel, and just enter commands here (but don't actually talk in the room).  Depending on how the game goes, we might all type commands as they strike us, or we might elect one person to type commands based on suggestions made on the channel.  Depends on the game."

</TD><td></td></TR>

</TD><td></td><td></td></TR>

<TR><td></td><TD><b>Jacqueline</b> says, "Right.  We want everyone to be able to see the command that was given."

<b>Floyd</b> | Lines represent the passage of light, bounced or bent.  Your master

<b>Floyd</b> | Considerable text accompanies these drawings, but since it is neither

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Beyond the four elements there is a fifth; as the others are to the

<b>Floyd</b> | Top of Cistern
<b>Floyd</b> | This is the rim of a great cistern, which is built of bricks and lined

<b>Floyd</b> | with plaster, and must be very old.  Along the inside of the cistern,
<b>Floyd</b> | a spiral stair descends towards the surface of the water, more than a
<b>Floyd</b> | full story below you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The walls themselves are painted with images of the vast unsociable
<b>Floyd</b> | ocean: of the broad empty water, the clustering clouds, the thin and

<b>Floyd</b> | distant crust that is the beginning of the New World.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Tower, Bottom
<b>Floyd</b> | You stand at the bottom of a stone tower.  Doorways open in each of
<b>Floyd</b> | the cardinal directions, except for the north; there, a spacious niche
<b>Floyd</b> | contains the statue of a woman, skillfully executed in white marble.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The center of the room is occupied by a spiral staircase, but one made
<b>Floyd</b> | of such slender and delicate supports that it obscures neither light
<b>Floyd</b> | nor view.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The silvery door to the south stands open.

<b>Floyd</b> | Stairs lead up, and doorways open south, east and west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Dome of Broken Light
<b>Floyd</b> | A straight white light comes through the hole in the ceiling, but it

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | East and west, low corridors lead into shadow.

<b>Floyd</b> | Zoo of Marvels

<b>Floyd</b> | A long, vaulted room, lined with cages of filigree and jewels.  All of

<b>Floyd</b> | taxidermist.  In one cage is an elephant, so short that he reaches
<b>Floyd</b> | only to your knee; you easily could lift him under one arm and carry
<b>Floyd</b> | him away.  In another cage, a giant mouse lies, curled as though
<b>Floyd</b> | slumbering, his paws folded in the semblance of prayer.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Mounted on a swivel on the wall is what looks like an irregular
<b>Floyd</b> | hourglass, one bulb larger than the other.  There is no sand within --
<b>Floyd</b> | nor could there be, since the contraption is open at each end.  At the

<b>Floyd</b> | Top of Cistern

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The walls themselves are painted with images of the vast unsociable

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Tower, Bottom
<b>Floyd</b> | You stand at the bottom of a stone tower.  Doorways open in each of

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The center of the room is occupied by a spiral staircase, but one made

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Mounted on a swivel on the wall is what looks like an irregular

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The center of the room is occupied by a spiral staircase, but one made

<b>Floyd</b> | Top of Cistern
<b>Floyd</b> | This is the rim of a great cistern, which is built of bricks and lined

<b>Floyd</b> | full story below you.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The walls themselves are painted with images of the vast unsociable

<b>Floyd</b> |
