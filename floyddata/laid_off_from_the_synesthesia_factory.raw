						The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each
						week at a pre-arranged time, a group of
						people meet online to cooperatively play
						a game of interactive fiction.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Laid Off from the Synesthesia Factory</em> written by Katherine Morayati.
						
						
						<I>Laid off from the Synesthesia Factory</I> placed 30th in the 2015 Interactive Fiction Competition, and as of the date of this transcript has been nominated for three Xyzzy Awards (Best Writing, Best Use of Innovation, and Best Implementation). 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting
						
						
							
								the IFDB page:

					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing these games, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played these games, and think you might like to at some

</b><b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Laid Off from the Synesthesia Factory</span> is a work of parser
<b>Floyd</b> | interactive fiction. In parser IF, one progresses through the work by
<b>Floyd</b> | entering commands at the command prompt. Some parser IF is designed
<b>Floyd</b> | around puzzles; this work is puzzleless. Think of it as akin to a
<b>Floyd</b> | short story, or perhaps what's increasingly called "dynamic fiction."
<b>Floyd</b> | The point is not to win but to explore: to build a story, and choose
<b>Floyd</b> | what goes into it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Laid Off from the Synesthesia Factory</span> accepts standard parser
<b>Floyd</b> | commands as well as individual keywords. For instance, you could type
<b>Floyd</b> | "examine computer" or simply "computer." The latter method may be used
<b>Floyd</b> | on many salient words or phrases in the story, often more than once.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Laid Off from the Synesthesia Factory</span> is effectively a story
<b>Floyd</b> | generator, as well as a work of interactive fiction. The downloadable
<b>Floyd</b> | version will produce a text file, intended to be read alone as
<b>Floyd</b> | standalone prose. Note: Quixe does not currently support this feature.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Those used to traditional IF are advised that certain meta-commands
<b>Floyd</b> | are not supported, for example SAVE, RESTORE and UNDO. Other verbs,
<b>Floyd</b> | such as LOOK, will work differently than one may expect. The work is
<b>Floyd</b> | short enough and puzzleless enough that they are not necessary.

<b>Floyd</b> | A story, eventually; by Katherine Morayati
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 3 / Serial number 151021 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib
<b>Floyd</b> | 6/12N)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Studio 4D, 7:00 pm</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An afterimage is a visual left lingering before your eyes, after
<b>Floyd</b> | you've focused on one thing too long; burnt-out retinae, producing
<b>Floyd</b> | bullshit.  If you've seen red you produce un-red; blue, un-blue;
<b>Floyd</b> | green, un-green. An involuntary strike. The state is not permanent,
<b>Floyd</b> | until it is.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your primary project at Synfac was developing wearables. But your
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">last</span> project was sentiment analysis. Intern work. Your job
<b>Floyd</b> | was to mine influential tweeters, popular song, emails and letters and
<b>Floyd</b> | texts acquired for you by means you'd rather not consider, for the
<b>Floyd</b> | oily stuff of emotion. This was supposed to focus you. Instead you're
<b>Floyd</b> | now a broke computer, made of errors: tweet fragments, disheveled
<b>Floyd</b> | paragraphs, bastardized sentiment. You have no sentences, just quips;
<b>Floyd</b> | no thoughts, only responses. Here is one:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Laid off from the synesthesia factory. Branded a fool. What will</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">they say, Monday at --</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You have gotten no further. There is no rhyme to what you do now. And
<b>Floyd</b> | at any rate, your concern is not Monday at whenever the hell. Your
<b>Floyd</b> | concern is tonight at 8 PM.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | * * *
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Synfac originally hired you as a copywriter, then promoted you to
<b>Floyd</b> | amorphous creative, then gradually demoted you once they detected a
<b>Floyd</b> | lack of actual creating. This was not in the plan; you took the job a
<b>Floyd</b> | year ago knowing headquarters were far from any robust job market. It
<b>Floyd</b> | was less a move than a trust fall.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To compensate, Synfac put you up in a company apartment and paid the
<b>Floyd</b> | first month's rent. Nothing extravagant, of course: a studio, slightly
<b>Floyd</b> | under market rate but of course not free; a bit over-sparsely
<b>Floyd</b> | furnished, as if they'd rented the unit expecting a bachelor; full to
<b>Floyd</b> | distraction with Synfac technology, to remind you that the space was
<b>Floyd</b> | meant for after-hours research. Even the unit number was deliberate,
<b>Floyd</b> | as explained to you on day one: Studio 4D, the fourth dimension. Which
<b>Floyd</b> | is time, of which you now have an abundance.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You've got to admire how legit it all was: standard real estate
<b>Floyd</b> | company, standard contract and standard lease, and this year's lease
<b>Floyd</b> | doesn't end until December. Optimism: You get to stay here even after
<b>Floyd</b> | your layoff. Pessimism: You must.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Without your Synpiece with you, the room is blank and chilly, less
<b>Floyd</b> | modern design than empty ice tray. Everything is some form of inert
<b>Floyd</b> | gray: dormant green-screen wall paneling, dresser practically frozen
<b>Floyd</b> | shut, desk a little more cluttered these days but as desks go still
<b>Floyd</b> | austere. Only your saturator pole seems obviously amiss.

<b>Floyd</b> | A story, eventually; by Katherine Morayati
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 4 / Serial number 151206 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Studio 4D, 7:00 pm</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An afterimage is a visual left lingering before your eyes, after
<b>Floyd</b> | you've focused on one thing too long; burnt-out retinae, producing
<b>Floyd</b> | bullshit.  If you've seen red you produce un-red; blue, un-blue;
<b>Floyd</b> | green, un-green. An involuntary strike. The state is not permanent,
<b>Floyd</b> | until it is.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your primary project at Synfac was developing wearables. But your
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">last</span> project was sentiment analysis. Intern work. Your job
<b>Floyd</b> | was to mine influential tweeters, popular song, emails and letters and
<b>Floyd</b> | texts acquired for you by means you'd rather not consider, for the
<b>Floyd</b> | oily stuff of emotion. This was supposed to focus you. Instead you're
<b>Floyd</b> | now a broke computer, made of errors: tweet fragments, disheveled
<b>Floyd</b> | paragraphs, bastardized sentiment. You have no sentences, just quips;
<b>Floyd</b> | no thoughts, only responses. Here is one:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Laid off from the synesthesia factory. Branded a fool. What will</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">they say, Monday at --</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You have gotten no further. There is no rhyme to what you do now. And
<b>Floyd</b> | at any rate, your concern is not Monday at whenever the hell. Your
<b>Floyd</b> | concern is tonight at 8 PM.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | * * *
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Synfac originally hired you as a copywriter, then promoted you to
<b>Floyd</b> | amorphous creative, then gradually demoted you once they detected a
<b>Floyd</b> | lack of actual creating. This was not in the plan; you took the job a
<b>Floyd</b> | year ago knowing headquarters were far from any robust job market. It
<b>Floyd</b> | was less a move than a trust fall.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To compensate, Synfac put you up in a company apartment and paid the
<b>Floyd</b> | first month's rent. Nothing extravagant, of course: a studio, slightly
<b>Floyd</b> | under market rate but of course not free; a bit over-sparsely
<b>Floyd</b> | furnished, as if they'd rented the unit expecting a bachelor; full to
<b>Floyd</b> | distraction with Synfac technology, to remind you that the space was
<b>Floyd</b> | meant for after-hours research. Even the unit number was deliberate,
<b>Floyd</b> | as explained to you on day one: Studio 4D, the fourth dimension. Which
<b>Floyd</b> | is time, of which you now have an abundance.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You've got to admire how legit it all was: standard real estate
<b>Floyd</b> | company, standard contract and standard lease, and this year's lease
<b>Floyd</b> | doesn't end until December. Optimism: You get to stay here even after
<b>Floyd</b> | your layoff. Pessimism: You must.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Without your Synpiece with you, the room is blank and chilly, less
<b>Floyd</b> | modern design than empty ice tray. Everything is some form of inert
<b>Floyd</b> | gray: dormant green-screen wall paneling, dresser practically frozen
<b>Floyd</b> | shut, desk a little more cluttered these days but as desks go still
<b>Floyd</b> | austere. Only your saturator pole seems obviously amiss.

<b>Floyd</b> | design" in range of someone whose earshot was triply unfortunate:
<b>Floyd</b> | someone wonky enough to pay attention to programmers, pretentious
<b>Floyd</b> | enough to wonk over monochrome design publications, and executive
<b>Floyd</b> | enough to wrench his pretentions into an official pivot. Thus rose,
<b>Floyd</b> | like a techy Tower of Babel, the Saturator, which (the pitch goes)
<b>Floyd</b> | detects your emotional undercurrent -- your presence, basically -- and
<b>Floyd</b> | infuses the room with simpatico ambience and portent, like an air
<b>Floyd</b> | freshener for mood. (The original tagline said "incense for mood," but
<b>Floyd</b> | marketing thought that sounded too hippie, someone higher-up and
<b>Floyd</b> | unbuttoned asked whether there was a type of incense <span class="floydstyle em">not</span> for
<b>Floyd</b> | mood, and thence went the afternoon.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It took another month of meetings to persuade legal to have one
<b>Floyd</b> | installed in your apartment, a month you regretted once the prototype
<b>Floyd</b> | came in: a Super Mario-esque monstrosity that protruded horizontally
<b>Floyd</b> | over the bed and across the room, like a fluorescent light if those
<b>Floyd</b> | were large and killed you if you woke up wrong. You bitched, others
<b>Floyd</b> | bitched, and from the bitching came the current model: a vertical pole
<b>Floyd</b> | where a heating pipe would be, slender, slightly gnarled and ending in
<b>Floyd</b> | a broad starburst two feet from the ceiling. It pulses with a deep
<b>Floyd</b> | unidentifiable color; in about a three-centimeter radius surrounding
<b>Floyd</b> | the pole are cilia of iridescent light. You think it resembles a
<b>Floyd</b> | maypole. Everyone else who's ever been in your place thinks stripper
<b>Floyd</b> | pole. At one point that was funny.

<b>Floyd</b> | One system: the Luscher Color Test, in vogue a few decades ago but now

<b>Floyd</b> | Every phobia has two parts. There is the phobia itself. Then there is

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One known phobia: scopophobia, the fear of being watched. According to

<b>Floyd</b> | in 1906, scopophobia is most common in women. This is not elaborated
<b>Floyd</b> | further.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You are at your computer. The top Google results for scopophobia and
<b>Floyd</b> | women: 1. Wikipedia. 2. An online store of graphic tees for women:
<b>Floyd</b> | devils, evil eyes, glitterfied fear slogans, figures dripping with
<b>Floyd</b> | viscera. All form-fitting, naturally. 3. Something from something
<b>Floyd</b> | called the Creepypasta Wiki: "Do they see a monster wrapped delicately
<b>Floyd</b> | within glittering wrapping paper? Do they see malice hidden within me
<b>Floyd</b> | or do they see an ingenue?" There are comments on this. They gave this
<b>Floyd</b> | scopophobia an 8 out of 10.
