The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>The Unicorn Pool</i>, written by Tiddy Ogg.  <I>The Unicorn Pool</I> was originally released in 2010.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/The_Unicorn_Pool'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is late afternoon, and the previously busy market place now has
<b>Floyd</b> | only a few stragglers trying to find last-minute bargains.
<b>Floyd</b> |  Your stall is now devoid of all the home-grown delights that were
<b>Floyd</b> | piled on the table, and you are preparing to pack things away and
<b>Floyd</b> | return to your house.
<b>Floyd</b> | It seems that Giles, next stall along, (for whom you have a secret
<b>Floyd</b> | fondness,) has also had a good day.  He stands, with the last
<b>Floyd</b> | remaining apple tree sapling that he has left for sale.
<b>Floyd</b> |  You look shyly towards him, but all his attention is taken up gazing
<b>Floyd</b> | at Grace, the beautiful daughter of the local squire who approaches
<b>Floyd</b> | Giles' stall.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hardly sparing a glance at the tree she throws some money at Giles'
<b>Floyd</b> | feet and instructs him to deliver it immediately to the Hall.
<b>Floyd</b> |  She sweeps away with a wiggle and a show of shapely leg below her
<b>Floyd</b> | silk gown, and Giles trots along obediently behind her like a faithful
<b>Floyd</b> | dog.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Unicorn Pool
<b>Floyd</b> | A fable owing much to Theodore Sturgeon, Thomas Hardy, and the film A
<b>Floyd</b> | Kid For Two Farthings.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Type "examine me" to discover who you are.
<b>Floyd</b> | Type "about" to find out more about the game.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Market Square
<b>Floyd</b> | The market place has stalls arranged around its perimeter.
<b>Floyd</b> | The north side of the square is bordered by the entrance gate and
<b>Floyd</b> | boundary wall of the Hall, the squire's residence.
<b>Floyd</b> | Your house is along the road to the east, and the dismal bogland trail
<b>Floyd</b> | leads to the west.
<b>Floyd</b> | The southern road leads off to the big town many miles away which is
<b>Floyd</b> | far too distant to walk to.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's the end of the day and there is little left to buy, and few
<b>Floyd</b> | people still browsing.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Market Square

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The square's now almost deserted, the day after the market, and early

<b>Floyd</b> | The open gateway to your yard is at the east side.

<b>Floyd</b> | Your house is along the road to the east, and the dismal bogland trail
<b>Floyd</b> | leads to the west.
<b>Floyd</b> | The southern road leads off to the big town many miles away which is
<b>Floyd</b> | far too distant to walk to.
<b>Floyd</b> | There's no-one here at all now.  Ned and Jake have gone about their

<b>Floyd</b> | The flowery lane soon degenerates into  a dank track through  a series

<b>Floyd</b> | You can continue westwards deeper into the swamp, or return to the

<b>Floyd</b> | As you fit the collar on the goat, who is quietly munching the grass,
<b>Floyd</b> | Giles steps towards you.
<b>Floyd</b> | He staggers up to you and puts his hands on your shoulders, at which
<b>Floyd</b> | moment Billy gives a sidestep into you, you both overbalance and fall
<b>Floyd</b> | into the pond.
<b>Floyd</b> | You both stand up, laughing, and you look over to the animal, now free
<b>Floyd</b> | of your grasp on the rein.  With the sun at just this angle his grey
<b>Floyd</b> | coat seems pure white, and his little horns glow gold.
<b>Floyd</b> | It's only for an instant but it's enough...
<b>Floyd</b> | You look at Giles.  He, too, seems more handsome than ever.  He is
<b>Floyd</b> | looking at you in equal wonder... "Marty, you're beautiful!" and he
<b>Floyd</b> | kisses you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A derisive snort comes from the track, and you see the haughty Grace
<b>Floyd</b> | sneering at you both.  "Yes, take that peasant.  She's more your type,
<b>Floyd</b> | Giles," she cackles, whereupon Billy charges her and deposits her in
<b>Floyd</b> | the foul swamp on the opposite side of the track.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You both climb out of the pool, and retrieve Billy, and as you walk
<b>Floyd</b> | home - each beautiful in each other's eyes,   you know that maybe
<b>Floyd</b> | sometimes those fairy tales do come true.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In future years you often come wandering through the bogs together.
<b>Floyd</b> | You've never again found that magic pool, but along with your
<b>Floyd</b> | 'unicorn' live happily ever after.
