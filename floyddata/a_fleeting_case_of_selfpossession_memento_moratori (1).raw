The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.  Below is the 2010 IntroComp awards ceremony, immediately followed by a transcript of the top three 2010 IntroComp Games, written by various authors.<BR><BR>

<b>Floyd</b> | There's no rush, but by unspoken agreement you both climb up to the
<b>Floyd</b> | highest, fastest-moving tier of the ?lev?. The breeze stiffens as you
<b>Floyd</b> | ascend, but the ride is surprisingly smooth and pleasantly quiet.
<b>Floyd</b> | Plenty of free seats at the top; Emma carefully chooses one, waves at
<b>Floyd</b> | you to join her. You gratefully drop the luggage, fling yourself down,
<b>Floyd</b> | and take in the view.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Paris! At this height the people seem like toys, the city an elegantly
<b>Floyd</b> | sculpted model. You could easily imagine that your seat is stationary,
<b>Floyd</b> | and Paris itself is gliding dreamily past. There's no rush, not any
<b>Floyd</b> | more, but your heartbeat refuses to slow...
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Must be because you've almost arrived.

<b>Floyd</b> | Dusty driveway
<b>Floyd</b> |   Marrow is delicious but that's not why you're here. You're supposed
<b>Floyd</b> | to pick up a single jar of alien bone jelly, which of course can't
<b>Floyd</b> | exist and doesn't exist, so you've convinced yourself that

<b>Floyd</b> | transporting it is no crime. Getting worked up about such nonsense
<b>Floyd</b> | would be like fretting about mermaids getting caught in tuna nets, and
<b>Floyd</b> | you've got other fur-bearing fish to fry. All this rationalization
<b>Floyd</b> | hasn't exactly settled the New York strip steak you inhaled an hour
<b>Floyd</b> | ago, though.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | It's almost dusk. The sky is waffling between deep blue and indigo,
<b>Floyd</b> | but either way it's going to be a beautiful desert night in New
<b>Floyd</b> | Mexico. The only blight is the building before you: a grime-smeared
<b>Floyd</b> | shack with barred windows, a swatch of tar for a roof and a lawn that
<b>Floyd</b> | pretends to be a rock garden xeriscape, but is really just cheap
<b>Floyd</b> | chunks of broken cement.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This shanty has a single reinforced door with a peeper slit at eye
<b>Floyd</b> | level. The air tonight is quite dry and whisks away some of your
<b>Floyd</b> | anxious sweat... but also carries with it the scent of bad oysters.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A few feet from the house is Igor Cytserz's mailbox.
