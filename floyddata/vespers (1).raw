					</p>


					<p class="leftalign">
					<span class="fontish smaller">The idea behind ClubFloyd
						is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of 
						people meet online to cooperatively play a game of 
						interactive fiction.<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Vespers</em> written by Jason Devlin.
						Vespers won first place overall, as well as first place Miss Congeniality Awards, in the 2005 IF Comp.  It went on to be a darling of the 2005 XYZZYs (Winner, Best Game; Winner, Best Writing; Nominee, Best Story; Winner, Best Setting; Nominee, Best Puzzles; Winner, Best NPCs; Nominee, Best Individual NPC; Nominee, Best Individual PC). 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting

					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing this game, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played this game, and think you might like to at some
						point, I do not recommend reading any further. Instead,
						you might want to return to the <a class="decorate" href=

<b>Floyd</b> | Your old desk is pushed up against one side. It sags but holds itself

<b>Floyd</b> | There are no new verbs necessary to complete the game. However, one
<b>Floyd</b> | standard library verb has had its grammar considerably altered (and
<b>Floyd</b> | given the subject matter of the game, it shouldn't be too hard to
<b>Floyd</b> | guess which one).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Additionally, conversation is handled a little differently. One can
<b>Floyd</b> | TALK TO &lt;CHARACTER&gt; and have a general conversation about whatever
<b>Floyd</b> | seems most pertinent at the time (you can TALK TO them several times
<b>Floyd</b> | in a row to carry on the conversation). Alternatively, if that doesn't
<b>Floyd</b> | quench your thirst for knowledge, you can ASK, TELL, or TALK TO an NPC
<b>Floyd</b> | about &lt;TOPIC&gt;. All three give the same responses, however, so as to
<b>Floyd</b> | avoid the headaches associated with asking someone about something but
<b>Floyd</b> | not telling them about it first.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A WALKTHRU command is included if the hints aren't to your liking.
<b>Floyd</b> | Also, if you have trouble remembering the brothers or saints, type
<b>Floyd</b> | BROTHERS or SAINTS.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, if the boxed quotes bother you, you can get them to print
<b>Floyd</b> | QUOTES OFF at any time.  Type QUOTES ON to get things back to default.

<b>Floyd</b> | It has been five days, now. Five days since I made the choice. Five

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Really, there was no choice. Rovato was damned when the first spot

<b>Floyd</b> | Your Bedroom
<b>Floyd</b> | Your room is small; it is the same as all the others, but it seems

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A chill breeze spins in through the window and out the door to the

<b>Floyd</b> | Your old desk is pushed up against one side. It sags but holds itself
<b>Floyd</b> | up proudly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Against the other side is your bed, the blanket wrapped up in itself
