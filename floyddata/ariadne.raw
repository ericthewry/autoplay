						The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each

						people meet online to cooperatively play
						a game of interactive fiction.

						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Ariadne in Aeaea</em> written by Victor Ojuel.

<b>Floyd</b> |  "What tidings from the northern wastes?" asked the High Priestess.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Her elderly eyes were glued to the north, across the moonlit lagoon,
<b>Floyd</b> | beyond the cliffs on the other side, towards the great sea. Deep in
<b>Floyd</b> | though, she didn't notice a human shape silhouetted against the
<b>Floyd</b> | glistening waters, scurrying along the clifftop.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Alas, my potnia, the Achaeans have taken Tiryns", said the other
<b>Floyd</b> | woman, her voice so quiet her Egyptian lilt was almost unrecognisable
<b>Floyd</b> | "They are spreading through the Argolis like wildfire."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Wildfire", echoed the High Priestess. "The Achaeans have a new Wanax,
<b>Floyd</b> | do they not?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Be truer to say their new Wanax has them - lined up like pieces upon
<b>Floyd</b> | a game-board. Hear me, Circe, I have not the slightest doubt that he
<b>Floyd</b> | had a part in my sister's murder."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Circe turned with a placating gesture.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Before we publicly accuse the most powerful Wanax of the northern
<b>Floyd</b> | wastes of sacrilegious killing..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "My potnia, you and I know full well that my sister was all that stood
<b>Floyd</b> | between Achaean greed and the palace of Tiryns. Wake up, Circe. Palace
<b>Floyd</b> | after palace, they are bringing their sky-gods southwards and they
<b>Floyd</b> | care not an iota for us or the Goddess. Today it is Tiryns and
<b>Floyd</b> | tomorrow perhaps a closer port, and before we react they shall have a
<b>Floyd</b> | foothold in Crete. Perchance my potnia is growing soft in her old age?
<b>Floyd</b> | Maybe the Goddess needs a more... youthful vehicle for the fulfilment
<b>Floyd</b> | of her designs?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh, let me guess, one of you Avaris women? Do you reckon I cling to
<b>Floyd</b> | this life just to spite you?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Kindly give us your candidates for evaluation, then. One of your
<b>Floyd</b> | nieces, I suppose?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "In due time. Phaedra shows potential but she is still too young. And
<b>Floyd</b> | concerning Ariadne..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The other woman let go a short, hearty laugh.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ariadne! We Thebans always love a good joke, but it is high time we
<b>Floyd</b> | made a serious move, my potnia."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Very well. I shall send for her in the morning, and we shall reach a
<b>Floyd</b> | decision before sunset. In fact, you can go fetch my niece yourself."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Shepherd's hut</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | You wake up from a dream of winding passages and a beast chasing you,
<b>Floyd</b> | to a morning which is little better: no labyrinth but a tangle of
<b>Floyd</b> | limbs, no beast but a pulsing headache and a concert of snores. A
<b>Floyd</b> | pale, blueish light filters through the wooden ceiling.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Which is odd, because the living quarters of the palace are all stone,
<b>Floyd</b> | and the other priestesses are rarely this physically affectionate and
<b>Floyd</b> | come to think about that...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You open your eyes and bolt upright.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This is not quite the palace's living quarters, more like a ragged
<b>Floyd</b> | wooden shelter. Your memories of yesterday are vague: you remember
<b>Floyd</b> | waiting until the other novices fell asleep, climbing down the outer
<b>Floyd</b> | wall of the palace, sneaking along the clifftop to meet the shepherd
<b>Floyd</b> | boys, and then all is a blur.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An empty jug lies on its side against a wall, abandoned where it

<b>Floyd</b> | translator, based in Manchester, UK.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He has worked as a business consultant, advertising copywriter and
<b>Floyd</b> | fashion transcreator before writing videogames, among them
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle i">Pharaonic</span> (now on Steam), <span class="floydstyle i">Forgotten Kodama</span> and
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle i">Pilgrimage</span> (IFDB).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He has written a novel (<span class="floydstyle i">Ava Ström</span>, a university thriller with
<b>Floyd</b> | SF touches, now on Amazon) and is currently working on a second book,
<b>Floyd</b> | as well as a few undisclosed commercial projects. And, of course,
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle i">Mistress of the Labyrinth</span>, the original Ariadne game and an
<b>Floyd</b> | immediate sequel to the events of <span class="floydstyle i">Ariadne in Aeaea</span>. He is
<b>Floyd</b> | available as a freelance writer and narrative designer for videogames
<b>Floyd</b> | and other multimedia projects.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle i">Ariadne in Aeaea</span> is designed as a short, slightly
<b>Floyd</b> | tongue-in-cheek prologue to the events in the upcoming <span class="floydstyle i">Mistress of</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle i">the Labyrinth</span>. They are both based upon the author's
<b>Floyd</b> | reinterpretation of the myths of the sorceress Circe, Ariadne, queen
<b>Floyd</b> | Pasiphaë, king Minos, the Minotaur and Theseus as historical facts
<b>Floyd</b> | deformed by post-Homeric Greek propaganda. In this world, Ariadne is a
<b>Floyd</b> | priestess of the (chthonic, matriarcal, animistic) Cretan/Minoan
<b>Floyd</b> | civilisation. She is also a stand-in for her culture, pitted against
<b>Floyd</b> | the onslaught of Achaean (proto-Greek) expansion, in the late Bronze
<b>Floyd</b> | Age in the Aegean sea, around the 15th century BC.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Historically, this process ended with almost complete cultural
<b>Floyd</b> | assimilation, to the point that by Homer's time (400 to 600 years
<b>Floyd</b> | later) all traces of the Minoan culture where shrouded in legend.
<b>Floyd</b> | Nowadays it is extremely difficult to distinguish the Minoan roots of
<b>Floyd</b> | many aspects of Greek civilisation.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle i">Ariadne in Aeaea</span> specifically presents a conjectural theocratic
<b>Floyd</b> | society based on a fictional island, geographically modelled after
<b>Floyd</b> | Thera (Santorini) and culturally based on the Minoan palatial
<b>Floyd</b> | societies of Knossos and Phaistos. While most details are historically
<b>Floyd</b> | correct, the bigger picture is purely fictional - specially the notion
<b>Floyd</b> | of a somewhat centralised cult, Minoan in nature and with Egyptian
<b>Floyd</b> | influences, wielding significant international power and in control of
<b>Floyd</b> | a Mediterranean-wide network of priestesses cum diplomatic envoys and
<b>Floyd</b> | spies. While I believe it was entirely possible by the cultural and
<b>Floyd</b> | technological means of the era, there is no evidence of such a
<b>Floyd</b> | political structure ever existing.

<b>Floyd</b> | "My potnia, I come on behalf of my beloved sister..."

<b>Floyd</b> | A few priestesses blink, then nod respectfully as they pass, eyeing

<b>Floyd</b> | So your father must be a maker of daidala, and there are not many of

<b>Floyd</b> |
