The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Lethe Flow Phoenix</i>, written by Dan Shiovitz.  <I>Lethe Flow Phoenix</I> was originally released in August of 1995. It was originally written for the first IF Comp, but wasn't entered; the author thought it was too long for the competition.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Lethe_Flow_Phoenix'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> |    A beautifully-sculpted garden, bounded by brick walls to the north
<b>Floyd</b> | and west. A stream flows in from the east and curves to flow to the
<b>Floyd</b> | south, slowly drifting through the garden.  The brook lazily winds its
<b>Floyd</b> | way under the small bridges and between the large rocks and stone paths
<b>Floyd</b> | that have been placed here. Small, pretty bushes are scattered here as
<b>Floyd</b> | well, each one elegantly trimmed and shaped.  In one corner of the
<b>Floyd</b> | garden there is a fountain, shaped like a dragon's head.  From the
<b>Floyd</b> | dragon's open mouth flows a steady stream of water, falling into the
<b>Floyd</b> | brook.
<b>Floyd</b> |    The hedge beasts are curled up on the ground, practically
<b>Floyd</b> | indistinguishable from the normal hedges.
<b>Floyd</b> |    The crank turns, and the music box plays.  The peaceful sound of
<b>Floyd</b> | water running over rocks comes from the box.

<b>Floyd</b> | God took the four most boastful of the angels, and sent them down to

<b>Floyd</b> | in a year and a day, to say what you have learned."  So the angels came

<b>Floyd</b> |    The angels lived on earth for many months.  In that time, they lost

<b>Floyd</b> |    Daniel stares at you for an instant, almost fiercely.  "That is one

<b>Floyd</b> | A shorter one, this time:  Humans have never been alone in the
<b>Floyd</b> | universe.  There have been those who live under other skies, and even
<b>Floyd</b> | of those there have been some who sought out for other species like
<b>Floyd</b> | themselves.  But space is vast, more vast that can be comprehended, and
<b>Floyd</b> | in all time, only one other species has ever found the earth.  It is a
<b>Floyd</b> | pity that it was not a noble race.  They have no pronouncable name in
<b>Floyd</b> | any of the languages of people, but they care not that no one knows
<b>Floyd</b> | their name.  They came across the void of space, seeking slaves and
<b>Floyd</b> | treasure.  And they found both on this world.  So they sent down their
<b>Floyd</b> | war-ships to capture humans and enslave them, to carry off their riches
<b>Floyd</b> | and precious stones.  Humanity was threatened, and would have died.
<b>Floyd</b> |    But then three angels emerged, out into the light of redemption.
<b>Floyd</b> | Striking out at the invaders, they seemed unstoppable.  They had been
<b>Floyd</b> | stripped of much power, but still had great resource remaining.
<b>Floyd</b> | Raphael cast mountains against the invaders, rended their ships in
<b>Floyd</b> | twain with bare hands, struck missiles from their paths, before being
<b>Floyd</b> | crushed to earth by a great cannon-blast from the main ship.  Lilith
<b>Floyd</b> | sent the rivers out to battle, great tsunamis to knock ships from the
<b>Floyd</b> | air and blind their gunners, until she too was laid low by the enemy.
<b>Floyd</b> | Jaela Storm-lord, strongest of the three, sent lighting and thunder and
<b>Floyd</b> | tornados to rage against them, and finally forced them to flee.  But as
<b>Floyd</b> | they left, a treacherous energy bomb struck her, and the third of the
<b>Floyd</b> | angels fell."
<b>Floyd</b> |    Daniel pauses for a minute, and you can't help asking "What of D-
<b>Floyd</b> | What of the fourth angel?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "He arrived too late.  He was not on Earth, as the others were, and
<b>Floyd</b> | so he could not stand with them.  Daniel arrived only in time to hear
<b>Floyd</b> | his friends' dying words, and to swear a blood-oath to continue their
<b>Floyd</b> | struggle.  Because he had failed to protect them, failed to be there
<b>Floyd</b> | when they were, he swore to continue the mission that they had died to
<b>Floyd</b> | complete.  He would now protect Earth as they had.  So Daniel took
<b>Floyd</b> | people from Earth, and taught them all the secrets that he knew.  He
<b>Floyd</b> | gave them his magic, his strength, all his power.  And then he sent
<b>Floyd</b> | them back to live among the people until they were needed, until the
<b>Floyd</b> | invaders threatened earth a second time.  After that was complete,
<b>Floyd</b> | Daniel went away, to a land outside of the reality you live in, to sit
<b>Floyd</b> | and think, and reflect on his life.  Never more would the angels walk
<b>Floyd</b> | on earth.  But perhaps the sins of three had been accounted for."

<b>Floyd</b> | am very tired.  But I was tired before.  I brought you here because you
<b>Floyd</b> | must awaken.  And perhaps so that you can see Truth a bit more clearly.
<b>Floyd</b> |    It is true that the invaders have been working against you, yet many
<b>Floyd</b> | of the troubles in your life are your own doing, you know.  Before you
<b>Floyd</b> | return home, you must confront them, and yourself.  Then you can fly as
<b>Floyd</b> | a Phoenix must, because only a Phoenix can save the world now.
<b>Floyd</b> |    This place--" Daniel gestures with one shapely hand "is not quite
<b>Floyd</b> | the same as where you were before.  The spider venom should have killed
<b>Floyd</b> | you, as should the huge dose of mushroom that you took.  But instead,
<b>Floyd</b> | you came to me, to this dream-land that I live in.  In a minute, I will
<b>Floyd</b> | put you back in to the place you left, and give you some time to finish
<b>Floyd</b> | thinking about things.  But first, perhaps you have some questions
<b>Floyd</b> | about things?"

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> |    Yes, it's your father.  The man that left you when you were only six
<b>Floyd</b> | years old, leaving nothing but memories behind.  He never, ever even
<b>Floyd</b> | bothered to call, even on your birthdays.  Your mother never talked
<b>Floyd</b> | about him much, but when you got older, you realized his departure was
<b>Floyd</b> | probably responsible for her drinking problem, at the very least.
<b>Floyd</b> | Bastard.
<b>Floyd</b> |    The years seemed to have aged him deeper than they should have, but
<b>Floyd</b> | of course it's hard to tell.  His eyes are still the same burning blue
<b>Floyd</b> | that you remember from long-ago dreams.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Hello, son."  Your eyes open wide as you seen the man.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "D-D-Dad?  Is that you?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    Your father nods, slowly.  "Yeah, it's me."  He looks at you.
<b>Floyd</b> | "You've grown up."
<b>Floyd</b> |    Anger returns, almost involuntarily, as he speaks.  "Yes, I have.
<b>Floyd</b> | But you wouldn't know, would you?  You never came to see me."  Your
<b>Floyd</b> | voice is already trembling.
<b>Floyd</b> |    He looks pained, and suddenly shivers.  He starts to speak, stops,
<b>Floyd</b> | and starts again.  "I, I, I can't say much except ...  'sorry'?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    You interrupt his next words with a shout.  "Sorry?  Sorry???  You
<b>Floyd</b> | bastard, you left me alone, left Mom to drown her sorrows with all her
<b>Floyd</b> | fucking six-packs, and all you can say is 'sorry'??"
<b>Floyd</b> |    Your father seems staggered by the outburst.  Each word strikes him
<b>Floyd</b> | like a blow.  "I *am* sorry, so very very sorry.  I just couldn't
<b>Floyd</b> | handle it.  Having a child, losing my job ...  I stuck it out as long
<b>Floyd</b> | as I could, and then I ran.  Left one night, walked out the door, never
<b>Floyd</b> | came back ...  I'm sorry."  He seems close to tears.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Dammit, Dad, how could you do this?  Coward."  He shrinks away as
<b>Floyd</b> | you talk. You keep going, forcing him back.  "You left me.  You
<b>Floyd</b> | abandoned us.  You sent my life into a tailspin.  Me, the last hope for
<b>Floyd</b> | this crazy planet, me, the Phoenix, you ruined me.  You realize what
<b>Floyd</b> | you've done?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    Your father stands up straight then, and looks at you for a long
<b>Floyd</b> | minute.  When he speaks, his voice is firm again, and clear.  "I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | sorry.  It was inexcusable.  I had no right to run.  But you don't
<b>Floyd</b> | either."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "What?  What the hell are you talking about?  You're the problem
<b>Floyd</b> | here, not me."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Son, listen to me.  *Listen* to me.  When I ran, it was running
<b>Floyd</b> | away from myself.  You see ...  the Phoenix is carried by bloodlines.
<b>Floyd</b> | When I was young, I was Phoenix too."
<b>Floyd</b> |    You are too shocked to speak, so he continues.  "Yeah, that's right.
<b>Floyd</b> | The Phoenix is genetic.  But it fades as you get older, passes along to
<b>Floyd</b> | the young and vigorous.  Your great-aunt had it too, though not as
<b>Floyd</b> | strong as I saw it in you.  Don't you see why I ran?  I knew what my
<b>Floyd</b> | childhood was like ...  things going wrong for me in school, at home,
<b>Floyd</b> | the accident that took both *my* parents away.  I couldn't bear it
<b>Floyd</b> | twice, to see it happen to my child as They tried to get him too.  I
<b>Floyd</b> | just couldn't.  So I ran away.  Maybe I hoped, even, to draw Them away
<b>Floyd</b> | from you.  I was just playing into Their hands, I realize now, but I
<b>Floyd</b> | was still pretty young then.  So I ran from you, ran from
<b>Floyd</b> | responsibility, ran from the Phoenix.  My gift never awakened.  I never
<b>Floyd</b> | flew.  You've got to fly now, son, because I never could."
<b>Floyd</b> |    A quick pause, and he speaks again.  "I've been able to watch you a
<b>Floyd</b> | few times, as you grew up.  I saw you take the same paths I took,
<b>Floyd</b> | suffer the same things I did.  And I was never able to warn you.  It
<b>Floyd</b> | was agony.  Finally, They did get me after all -- a mistaken drive-by
<b>Floyd</b> | shooting, the police said -- and Daniel came to collect me.  *You* have
<b>Floyd</b> | got to break the pattern now.  Leave the cycle, and go fly free."  His
<b>Floyd</b> | voice stumbles to the end of the speech, and he takes a long shuddering
<b>Floyd</b> | breath.  "Break the cycle.  For me."  His hand stretches out to you.
<b>Floyd</b> | You slowly raise yours to meet his shadowy touch.  It is like touching
<b>Floyd</b> | air, almost, but not quite.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "I forgive you, Dad."  The words bring sweet release as you say
<b>Floyd</b> | them, starting the healing of too many lost years.
<b>Floyd</b> |    He smiles, the first smile of his you've seen since you were six.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Thanks." His hand reaches into his pocket, and he pulls something out.
<b>Floyd</b> | It drops onto the ground and rolls to your feet.  A bit of a grin comes
<b>Floyd</b> | to your father's face, and he says "Bust things wide open."  He looks
<b>Floyd</b> | at you for a long time, and then says one last word.  "Goodbye."
<b>Floyd</b> | Already, he is fading, and before the echo of the word has disappeared,
<b>Floyd</b> | he is no longer there.  Your father is gone, forever.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "'Bye, Dad."  You speak to the empty air, then bend down to see what
<b>Floyd</b> | he left you.
<b>Floyd</b> |    It seems to be one of the relics of the army stuff you remember he
<b>Floyd</b> | used to collect:  a hand grenade.  A curious gift, but surely he would
<b>Floyd</b> | have known what you needed right now.

<b>Floyd</b> |    Unlike the other times, the music does not end here.  Rather, the
<b>Floyd</b> | tiny crystal on the gnomon vibrates, giving the sound a third time at
<b>Floyd</b> | an even higher pitch.  A pure white column of light flashes downwards,
<b>Floyd</b> | stretching from the crystal in the ceiling to the crystal on the
<b>Floyd</b> | gnomon.  And when the light strikes the tiny crystal, it splits into
<b>Floyd</b> | six parts, each one spreading outwards to touch a hole.  From the
<b>Floyd</b> | holes, six lines of color reach upwards to the ceiling crystal again,
<b>Floyd</b> | and again they form a single pure white column falling downwards.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | effect is that of a pillar of shining rainbow, with a heart of glowing

<b>Floyd</b> |    Somehow, the sound reflects the visual, and the crystals are fairly

<b>Floyd</b> | into the darkness around it, and then there is a blinding/deafening

<b>Floyd</b> |    You blink your eyes and look around, pulling the sphere from the

<b>Floyd</b> | dull lusterless gray.  The other two crystals are nowhere to be seen.
<b>Floyd</b> |    A sudden grating sound from above your head attracts your attention.

<b>Floyd</b> | seemed sort of odd.  What the mirror actually does is reflect the one
<b>Floyd</b> | who views it, so isn't it far more truthful to have the mirror reflect
<b>Floyd</b> | ...  the past?  At least for this mirror, that seems to be true.
<b>Floyd</b> | Images begin to drift across the screen, like smoke rising from a fire,
<b>Floyd</b> | like clouds floating across the sky, like leaves riding a gentle
<b>Floyd</b> | stream-current.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    The first memories are pleasant.  You see your birthday party from
<b>Floyd</b> | age five, surrounded by both your parents and a circle of smiling
<b>Floyd</b> | friends .  .  .
<b>Floyd</b> | You see yourself, age six, with your dog Zippy, him barking madly and
<b>Floyd</b> | running in circles around tiny you as you throw sticks for him to fetch
<b>Floyd</b> | .  .  .
<b>Floyd</b> | There are other easy memories that come to mind, before the pictures
<b>Floyd</b> | turn darker.
<b>Floyd</b> | You see yourself cradling Zippy's broken and bloody body, crying into
<b>Floyd</b> | the dark night on an empty street .  .  .
<b>Floyd</b> | You see yourself, age seven, wailing because it is your birthday and
<b>Floyd</b> | your dad hasn't called for a year now .  .  .
<b>Floyd</b> | You see your mom staggering around the house, blind drunk, cursing and
<b>Floyd</b> | stumbling, and you hiding in the corner terrified .  .  .
<b>Floyd</b> | "These aren't *my* fault!"  you think, "The invaders, it's all their
<b>Floyd</b> | work.  How could they have ruined my life like this?  What did I do to
<b>Floyd</b> | deserve my shitty life?"
<b>Floyd</b> | Then that excuse is torn away as the pictures in the mirror shift
<b>Floyd</b> | again.
<b>Floyd</b> | Now you see yourself in high school, sitting at a desk.  Someone comes
<b>Floyd</b> | over to ask you a question and you turn your face away with a scowl.
<b>Floyd</b> | He retreats, a hurt expression on his face.
<b>Floyd</b> | And another scene, your senior year, someone asks you to the prom.
<b>Floyd</b> | Incredulous, you refuse, sure it's just a cruel joke.  Later, of
<b>Floyd</b> | course, you found out they had been deeply in love with you, but by
<b>Floyd</b> | then it was too late.  Too late .  .  .
<b>Floyd</b> | College, this time, and more of the same.  In all your classes, people
<b>Floyd</b> | try to reach out and are rebuffed.  You stagger through a year, and
<b>Floyd</b> | then another, spurning all attempts at friendship.  You flirt with
<b>Floyd</b> | alcohol and drugs for a while, finding solace there through a numbed
<b>Floyd</b> | mind, but eventually even those pale.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You stare at each of the memories as they flow across the face of
<b>Floyd</b> | the mirror.  Each one pains you, and it is a dual pain:  pain from
<b>Floyd</b> | recalling the emotions, and the pain of realization, the pain as you
<b>Floyd</b> | see your mistakes for what they are.  More and more images go past,
<b>Floyd</b> | each one a scene from your life.  Finally, you see the thing that drove
<b>Floyd</b> | you to the cliff-top, that night in your dorm when you cried out that
<b>Floyd</b> | no one loved you, no one in the world.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Perhaps for the same reasons and perhaps for others too, the scene
<b>Floyd</b> | brings you to tears one more time.  You lift your hand to your eye, and
<b>Floyd</b> | a single tear-drop tumbles down.  It glitters in a beam of sunlight as
<b>Floyd</b> | it falls oh-so-slowly, and splashes onto the mirror.  The mirror's
<b>Floyd</b> | surface ripples like water, and the pictures dissolve.  They are
<b>Floyd</b> | replaced by a black backdrop of star- spangled night, and Daniel's
<b>Floyd</b> | face.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Yes," says Daniel softly, "Yes.  You see it now.  Though you
<b>Floyd</b> | suffered in life, it was not all of others' doing.  You are ready for
<b>Floyd</b> | rebirth now, Phoenix. Fly."  He pauses for a minute and draws a shaky
<b>Floyd</b> | breath.  "You may turn the portal on now.  It is time for you to go
<b>Floyd</b> | home."  Daniel's image vanishes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Home?  It has been too long since the word meant anything to you.
<b>Floyd</b> | Still, he is right.  It is time to go home.

<b>Floyd</b> |    Well, well, you've finished the game.  Good going.  Here are some
<b>Floyd</b> | interesting/fun things to check out in the game, if you haven't
<b>Floyd</b> | already.  Most of these are unnecessary for completion of the game, but
<b>Floyd</b> | are amusing to do:
<b>Floyd</b> |    * Try and get 100% of the minor goals done.
<b>Floyd</b> |    * Be in different places on the gazebo as it flies up.
<b>Floyd</b> |    * Tease the hedge beasts.  They're pretty smart, and hopefully
<b>Floyd</b> | they'll notice if you have their tools, or if their tools are on the
<b>Floyd</b> | ground.  Speaking of which, have you tried taking the tools from under
<b>Floyd</b> | the bushes as the hedge beasts are waking?
<b>Floyd</b> |    * Figure out what the green dial on the remote does.
<b>Floyd</b> |    * The spade and rake can't actually be used for digging or raking,
<b>Floyd</b> | but there's cute messages for why not.
<b>Floyd</b> |    * You can pick the flowers in the startroom.  They're useless, but
<b>Floyd</b> | look kinda nice :)
<b>Floyd</b> |    * There's about a half-dozen visions to look at in the desert.
<b>Floyd</b> | Also, there's a rather mysterious object there.  (Daniel hints at its
<b>Floyd</b> | function, perhaps.)
<b>Floyd</b> |    * Speaking of whom ...  Daniel doesn't respond to a lot, but he
<b>Floyd</b> | knows a few things.  You can show him the note, among other things, and
<b>Floyd</b> | ask him about the following:  himself, the apple tree, the hedge
<b>Floyd</b> | beasts, the robin, your father, the invaders, yourself, phoenix,
<b>Floyd</b> | returning home, God, the angels (or refer by name), the gazebo, Polly,
<b>Floyd</b> | Zippy, the desert, the sun, the sundial, the brook, the note, "here",
<b>Floyd</b> | and the glass bottle.
<b>Floyd</b> |    * The apple tree knows somewhat less.  You can ask him to give you
<b>Floyd</b> | the glider or the apples, and ask him about:  the apples, himself, the
<b>Floyd</b> | glider, the brook, the sun, his problem, the robin, climbing, the hedge
<b>Floyd</b> | beasts, and the hedges.  He also has a certain amount of responses when
<b>Floyd</b> | you do things involving the robin (try throwing things at the robin,
<b>Floyd</b> | for instance).
<b>Floyd</b> |    Hopefully that's enough to get you interested.  There's lots more to
<b>Floyd</b> | see here.  Most of the Cool Stuff (tm) is unnecessary to winning the
<b>Floyd</b> | game (the hedge beasts, for example), but it's fun to write.  (Not fun
<b>Floyd</b> | to debug though!)  Welcome to my world.  Now that you've got the
<b>Floyd</b> | important stuff done, feel free to look at the odds and ends left over.
