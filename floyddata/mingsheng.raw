The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Mingsheng</i>, written by Deane Saunders.  <i>Mingsheng</i> was originally released as part of the 2004 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took seventh place. It went on to be nominated for a Xyzzy Award for Best Setting.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Mingsheng"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | Your interpreter says that it is at least v1.0 of the z-machine

<b>Floyd</b> | standard, so it may be able to support extended Unicode.
<b>Floyd</b> | Your font does not appear to be able to display Unicode Chinese
<b>Floyd</b> | characters.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If your interpreter/font does not support full extended Unicode and
<b>Floyd</b> | therefore does not display Chinese characters (Simsun for example, is a

<b>Floyd</b> | font that can), you have the option of displaying the Pinyin
<b>Floyd</b> | (Romanized) equivalent, complete with tone numbers. If you elect to
<b>Floyd</b> | have this option on, they will appear in brackets where Chinese
<b>Floyd</b> | characters would be, or next to them if your font supports them.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The option can be turned on and off later by using "pinyin on" and

<b>Floyd</b> | "pinyin off".
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For a brief explanation of Mandarin Pinyin tones, and to check the
<b>Floyd</b> | current status, type "pinyin".
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Press y to enable Pinyin, or anything else to continue without.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You had heard a great many stories in your time. Your childhood had

<b>Floyd</b> | been filled with tales of heroic characters who possessed great
<b>Floyd</b> | spiritual powers and incredible skill in martial arts.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Many of those in your village were taught martial arts since childhood,
<b>Floyd</b> | yet it always seemed to you that there was something lacking in such a
<b>Floyd</b> | life - bearing always towards physical strength.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Others in your village had become important spiritual leaders, yet once
<b>Floyd</b> | again such a one-sided devotion to the spiritual left something to be
<b>Floyd</b> | desired.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One day, disheartened by this state of affairs, you decided to change

<b>Floyd</b> | things. With only a few rumours of a temple complex to the east and a
<b>Floyd</b> | crude map of the forest to guide you, you set off to follow legends of
<b>Floyd</b> | a wise old man. The legends said that he had combined martial arts with
<b>Floyd</b> | spiritual philosophy, apparently through the observation of nature -
<b>Floyd</b> | how this was achieved, nobody seemed to know.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Arriving in the black of night, only to find yourself confronted by a
<b>Floyd</b> | large door to the east, you decided to sleep on the problem and wait
<b>Floyd</b> | until morning.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sunlight on your face awakens you.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | Pinyin is the standard romanization of spoken Mandarin Chinese. It was
<b>Floyd</b> | developed in around 1949 after the formation of the People's Republic
<b>Floyd</b> | of China and replaced the Wade-Giles system, which was a far less
<b>Floyd</b> | accurate way of representing spoken Chinese sounds. The Wade-Giles

<b>Floyd</b> | method did not employ tone numbers, which tells the reader how to
<b>Floyd</b> | pronounce the word accurately by altering the pitch. Pinyin manages to
<b>Floyd</b> | do this however, by the use of numbers. A number is placed after each
<b>Floyd</b> | syllable, which indicates the pitch in which it is to be spoken.
<b>Floyd</b> | Discussing intricacies of the exact pronounciation of the different
<b>Floyd</b> | consonants and vowels is beyond the scope of this game and it is left

<b>Floyd</b> | up to the player's own discretion to find out more - however the tone
<b>Floyd</b> | numbers are as follows:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 1: A long, even, high-level tone.
<b>Floyd</b> | 2: A rising tone, starting at natural level and rising to the high
<b>Floyd</b> | tone. Fairly short.

<b>Floyd</b> | 3: A long, falling, rising tone. Starting at natural level, falling to
<b>Floyd</b> | low level, rising to highest level.
<b>Floyd</b> | 4: A short, falling tone, beginning at highest level, falling to low
<b>Floyd</b> | level.
<b>Floyd</b> | 5 (or numberless): A short, soft tone at normal speaking pitch. Also
<b>Floyd</b> | known as the Neutral tone.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Pinyin with tone numbers is currently set to: OFF.

<b>Floyd</b> | You begin to get the idea that the cavern contains much Yin. It is

<b>Floyd</b> | As you try to pass through it, it seems to solidify and darken at the

<b>Floyd</b> | Despite the air of decay that the outside (and indeed the inside) of

<b>Floyd</b> | the building presents, there is a strange homely warmth to it. A sense
<b>Floyd</b> | of stillness and focus pervades your being, making you feel relaxed yet
<b>Floyd</b> | alert. The structure above creaks in the sunlight, while the floating
<b>Floyd</b> | feathers of birds roosting above add to the dreamlike quality.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see an old man here.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The old man says, "I will test your understanding. I will attack you
<b>Floyd</b> | five times in a row - if you manage to defeat me three times in a row,
<b>Floyd</b> | I will know that you have attained understanding. If you fail, you may
<b>Floyd</b> | try again - I am not so harsh a master as others."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Despite his apparent frailty, the old man suddenly moves with the grace
<b>Floyd</b> | of a snake. As he prepares to strike, you recognise his stance as the
<b>Floyd</b> | element of fire.
