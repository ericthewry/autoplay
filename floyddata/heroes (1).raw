The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Heroes</i>, written by Sean Barrett.  <I>Heroes</I> was released as part of the 2001 Interactive Fiction competition, where it took third place.  It was nominated for Xyzzies for Best Setting and Best Use of Medium.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Heroes'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | Adventurer:

<b>Floyd</b> | Baron Sedmon Ventillado. Sedmon Dragonslayer, now. The bastard. And in
<b>Floyd</b> | the meantime you've gone from Adrienne the Adventurer to Adrienne the
<b>Floyd</b> | Ruffian, the Rogue, or, most often, "You there!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Were you twenty years younger, it would be your name on everyone's
<b>Floyd</b> | lips. Your face on the popular paintings. And the Dragon Gem would be
<b>Floyd</b> | yours for everyone to covet. Funny when they tell you you shouldn't
<b>Floyd</b> | feel that way. And what do they tell you to feel instead?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | No regrets. Your days of heroism ceased when Thorn's Companions
<b>Floyd</b> | disbanded, yet your life--a new life--went on. Ha. You could never
<b>Floyd</b> | feel that way. For what kind of life is this? Your knowledge has
<b>Floyd</b> | faded. Your reflexes dulled. Your strength depleted. You've hardly
<b>Floyd</b> | cared if you live.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But now... the winds bring rumor that Sedmon means to give the Gem to
<b>Floyd</b> | Blackhelm. Blackhelm. That villain--the Dragon Gem is said to have
<b>Floyd</b> | powers, powers that one such as Blackhelm could bring to bear on those
<b>Floyd</b> | of Thorn's Companions who survived. With that threat, you find you do
<b>Floyd</b> | want to live after all. So you find yourself rebuilding your strength,
<b>Floyd</b> | retraining your eye, relearning your stratagems. Because you certainly
<b>Floyd</b> | know the solution to this problem.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The best way to be sure the Dragon Gem stays out of Blackhelm's hands?
<b>Floyd</b> | Get it in yours.

<b>Floyd</b> | Temple of Justice: Foyer
<b>Floyd</b> | An imposing foyer, designed carefully to the Royal Crown's
<b>Floyd</b> | specifications. The corridor narrows slowly to the east, making it
<b>Floyd</b> | seem impossibly long. This is enough to scare off some visitors.
<b>Floyd</b> | Moreover, a supplicant desiring to appear in the Temple of Justice
<b>Floyd</b> | proper must endure a long walk under the watchful eye of the guards in
<b>Floyd</b> | the guardhouse to the north. The Royal Highness has found this
<b>Floyd</b> | effective at dissuading supplicants from raising their original
<b>Floyd</b> | complaints once they enter the temple to the east.

<b>Floyd</b> | Baron Sedmon Ventillado. Sedmon Dragonslayer, now. Laughable.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Were you twenty years younger, it would be your name on everyone's
<b>Floyd</b> | lips. Your face on the popular paintings. And the Dragon Gem would be
<b>Floyd</b> | yours for everyone to covet. It is astonishing the progress you have
<b>Floyd</b> | made. The focus and concentration on the Art you can engage now--for
<b>Floyd</b> | you have conquered such distractions. So.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | No regrets. Your days of heroism ceased when Thorn's Companions
<b>Floyd</b> | disbanded, yet your life--a new life--went on. A Master Thaumaturge.
<b>Floyd</b> | Your advances in divining from water ripples have given you a name in
<b>Floyd</b> | certain Circles, and you'd have thought your future assured.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But now... the winds bring rumor that Sedmon means to give the Gem to
<b>Floyd</b> | Blackhelm. Blackhelm. That villain--the Dragon Gem is said to have
<b>Floyd</b> | powers, powers that one such as Blackhelm could bring to bear on those
<b>Floyd</b> | of Thorn's Companions who survived. Blackhelm. A mere dabbler in the
<b>Floyd</b> | Art; but... You possess too little knowledge of Summoning to know what
<b>Floyd</b> | use the Dragon Gem would have, but you do not care to find out from
<b>Floyd</b> | the wrong end.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The best way to be sure the Dragon Gem stays out of Blackhelm's hands?
<b>Floyd</b> | Get it in yours.

<b>Floyd</b> | Baron Sedmon Ventillado. Sedmon Dragonslayer, now. Strutting in the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Were you twenty years younger, it would be your name on everyone's
<b>Floyd</b> | lips. Your face on the popular paintings. And the Dragon Gem would be
<b>Floyd</b> | yours for everyone to covet. Ah, the foolishness of youth, for what
<b>Floyd</b> | wine would those words buy? What men would such pictures bed? Far
<b>Floyd</b> | better to simply sell the thing to a dandy like Ventillado. Too bad it
<b>Floyd</b> | went for such a pittance, since nobody else would touch the damn
<b>Floyd</b> | thing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | No regrets. Your days of heroism ceased when Thorn's Companions
<b>Floyd</b> | disbanded, yet your life--a new life--went on. A better life. For
<b>Floyd</b> | thieving is best practised in secret, and now your skills have grown
<b>Floyd</b> | far beyond what your companions might have ever imagined you could
<b>Floyd</b> | possess. Enough to rob a sleeping dragon in his very lair.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But now... the winds bring rumor that Sedmon means to sell the Gem to
<b>Floyd</b> | Blackhelm. Blackhelm. That villain--the Dragon Gem is said to have
<b>Floyd</b> | powers, powers that one such as Blackhelm could bring to bear on those
<b>Floyd</b> | of Thorn's Companions who survived. Knowing Blackhelm, it was not
<b>Floyd</b> | chance, after all, that you overheard gossip about the Dragon Gem.
<b>Floyd</b> | Easy to imagine Blackhelm pulling the strings from behind the scene,
<b>Floyd</b> | playing you for the fool. So.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The best way to be sure the Dragon Gem stays out of Blackhelm's hands?
<b>Floyd</b> | Get it back in yours.

<b>Floyd</b> | Sturdy, functional buildings lie in and out of shadow on the road to

<b>Floyd</b> | Royalty:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Baron Sedmon Ventillado. Sedmon Dragonslayer, now. The peasantry do
<b>Floyd</b> | love to forget a title and pretend a hero is one of theirs.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Were you twenty years younger, it would be your name on everyone's
<b>Floyd</b> | lips. Your face on the popular paintings. And the Dragon Gem would be
<b>Floyd</b> | yours for everyone to covet. Of course, it is your name on the royal
<b>Floyd</b> | decrees, your face on the coins, and your pick of the Royal Jewels for
<b>Floyd</b> | your costume each day. But you detect an honesty in the grotesque
<b>Floyd</b> | admiration for the Baron--one you'll not find in the simpering toadies
<b>Floyd</b> | who serve you. But no.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | No regrets. Your days of heroism ceased when Thorn's Companions
<b>Floyd</b> | disbanded, yet your life--a new life--went on. The things you did
<b>Floyd</b> | then--the life you abandoned--all small prices to have paid for the
<b>Floyd</b> | luxurious lifestyle you've gained.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But now... the winds bring rumor that Ventillado means to give the Gem
<b>Floyd</b> | to Blackhelm. Blackhelm. That villain--the Dragon Gem is said to have
<b>Floyd</b> | powers, powers that one such as Blackhelm could bring to bear on those
<b>Floyd</b> | of Thorn's Companions who survived. Thankfully, Ventillado is said to
<b>Floyd</b> | be a loyal citizen of the crown. And you can afford to be generous in
<b>Floyd</b> | recompense.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The best way to be sure the Dragon Gem stays out of Blackhelm's hands?
<b>Floyd</b> | Get it in yours.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Baron Sedmon Ventillado. Sedmon Dragonslayer, then. We laughed, for we
<b>Floyd</b> | seemed alive, still.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We had been twenty years younger, then we would have been the name on
<b>Floyd</b> | the man-things' lips. We would have been the visage on their
<b>Floyd</b> | paintings. And we would still have the Kthyress Crystal with which we
<b>Floyd</b> | would bring covetousness into man-things' hearts. But we were too
<b>Floyd</b> | young for detection of certain trickery; we were too old for
<b>Floyd</b> | resistance to certain magics. We had failed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We had felt no regrets twenty years before. We had ceased our toils at
<b>Floyd</b> | heroism when we saw the end of Thorn's Companions; but we had lived
<b>Floyd</b> | still, we had begun a new life. We paid the price for our youthful
<b>Floyd</b> | indiscretion; we were made small by Sethidrac's assignment. We,
<b>Floyd</b> | guardian. We, to guard one-ninth of the Legacy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then we heard rumor on the winds. We heard of a transfer of the
<b>Floyd</b> | Crystal from Sedmon to Blackhelm. Blackhelm. A guileful creature
<b>Floyd</b> | amongst creatures of guile. We had our suspicions about the theft. And
<b>Floyd</b> | we knew of the powers of the Crystal. We wondered at Blackhelm's
<b>Floyd</b> | knowledge. We wondered at the anger in Blackhelm towards those who
<b>Floyd</b> | were amongst Thorn's companions.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We had been too long letting Sedmon hold the Crystal. We risked emnity
<b>Floyd</b> | from Sethidrac and Passidrac for too long. We could not yield the
<b>Floyd</b> | possession of the Crystal to Blackhelm. We had to make it ours.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Open Tunnel
<b>Floyd</b> | We were surrounded by the man-things' structures, structures of dead

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Were you twenty years younger, it would be your name on everyone's

<b>Floyd</b> | yours for everyone to covet. Of course, it is your name on the royal
<b>Floyd</b> | decrees, your face on the coins, and your pick of the Royal Jewels for
<b>Floyd</b> | your costume each day. But you detect an honesty in the grotesque
<b>Floyd</b> | admiration for the Baron--one you'll not find in the simpering toadies
<b>Floyd</b> | who serve you. But no.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | No regrets. Your days of heroism ceased when Thorn's Companions
<b>Floyd</b> | disbanded, yet your life--a new life--went on. The things you did
<b>Floyd</b> | then--the life you abandoned--all small prices to have paid for the
<b>Floyd</b> | luxurious lifestyle you've gained.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But now... the winds bring rumor that Ventillado means to give the Gem
<b>Floyd</b> | to Blackhelm. Blackhelm. That villain--the Dragon Gem is said to have
<b>Floyd</b> | powers, powers that one such as Blackhelm could bring to bear on those
<b>Floyd</b> | of Thorn's Companions who survived. Thankfully, Ventillado is said to
<b>Floyd</b> | be a loyal citizen of the crown. And you can afford to be generous in
<b>Floyd</b> | recompense.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The best way to be sure the Dragon Gem stays out of Blackhelm's hands?
<b>Floyd</b> | Get it in yours.

<b>Floyd</b> | Well-Traveled Road

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see four royal guards, Ventillado's servant, Lord Juffall
<b>Floyd</b> | Dricko, Duchess Dweluff Suffureghurz, Peer Fladarg Solfelargib, Lady

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Peer Solfelargib replies, "You don't say!"
