						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>The Cuckold's Egg</em> written by Daniel Ravipinto as Veronica Devon, 
						
						and <em>Hornets' Nest</em> written by Jason Lautzenheiser.
						These games were entered in the 2014 IntroComp. <I>The Cuckold's Egg</I> took first place, and <I>Hornets' Nest</I> placed in the Honorable category.

</b><b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The occupied territories.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Faith, but this has been worse than you could have imagined. You gave
<b>Floyd</b> | no thought when you left the capital; the promise of escape was too
<b>Floyd</b> | tempting and the intention of Jumaht's letter was too clear.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Its contents, however, were less so, and you have had far too much
<b>Floyd</b> | time in far too empty a land to think on their purpose. Over the last
<b>Floyd</b> | weeks of your journey, your worry and your homesickness have worked
<b>Floyd</b> | their way from an ache in your heart to a stone in your stomach.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As if to remind you of his own burden, Huwen brays and nuzzles your
<b>Floyd</b> | shoulder. You place a hand on his nose and whisper a word of thanks,
<b>Floyd</b> | for you are alone here except for him. Alone amongst the once-mad.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The gates of Diahl lie before you. Everything else lies behind. Your
<b>Floyd</b> | journey here is ended. Your work is just beginning.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle header">The Cuckold's Egg</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | A Tale of the Apostasy by Veronica Devon
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 1 / Serial number 140720 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
<b>Floyd</b> | 6/12N)

<b>Floyd</b> | Here, the path takes its final turn north, towards the gates of the

<b>Floyd</b> | below is unmarred by any obstruction.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You've tried to look the part of a merchant of modest means, and you

<b>Floyd</b> | southerner, a child of the plains and not the mountains. At least you
<b>Floyd</b> | are not the ochre of a capitaler, for you would not to be trusted on

<b>Floyd</b> | hardly blame him for it, as he is not alone in his vice.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Short and to the point, as all Jumaht's missives are.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Darius:</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">A murder has occurred in Diahl. It is to be investigated</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">immediately. It is not known by me or by anyone that this is linked to</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">cult or worship activities.</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Keep quiet on your journey. Keep to your principles. Keep to your</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">truths. And know always how very proud I am of you.</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At the bottom, he has added a personal postscript:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">We will speak when this is over. I am sorry about Adar.</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is not what is written that is so disturbing, but what is missing.
<b>Floyd</b> | "It is not known by me or anyone"? And yet it is to be investigated?
<b>Floyd</b> | Some part of you has hoped the postscript was the reason for the speed
<b>Floyd</b> | of your necessary departure - an excuse to get you away from the
<b>Floyd</b> | capital and all that had occurred. But there is more here, and that is
<b>Floyd</b> | more than merely worrisome. For it implies you - specifically you -
<b>Floyd</b> | were chosen for a reason.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A grammarie given only to initiates, though since it is written in the

<b>Floyd</b> | is inscribed the Brotherhood's creed: <span class="floydstyle em">The world deceives. The</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">world wishes to be deceived. The truth against the world.</span>

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This one is for official purposes; you left your personal notes in
<b>Floyd</b> | safekeeping before you left the capital. Flipping quickly through the
<b>Floyd</b> | fresh pages, running your fingers over the smooth parchment, reminds
<b>Floyd</b> | you how very far you are from civilization. You would not find its
<b>Floyd</b> | like for a hundred miles, you are certain.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the notebook's front page, you have made a list of tasks remaining
<b>Floyd</b> | to you:
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Find stable for Huwen.</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Find local hall of records. (Contact - trustworthy?)</span>

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">(What of Silenus?)</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You jotted these down in an attempt to codify the work awiating you in
<b>Floyd</b> | Diahl, a week ago. It was at one of the last inns you passed, the last
<b>Floyd</b> | time you had a bath and a decent meal. You recall writing the last
<b>Floyd</b> | entry with a distinct sense of unease.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You are just about to close the book when your eyes catch on an
<b>Floyd</b> | imperfection: there is writing on the inside cover.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Entire volumes could be filled on the subject of the Apostasy - its
<b>Floyd</b> | histories, its roots, its purposes. You know the party line of history
<b>Floyd</b> | well enough: of the rising of the meek to their inheritance, the
<b>Floyd</b> | joining of the forgotten and the downtrodden to lay low the mighty.
<b>Floyd</b> | You also know the reality behind the slogans: the uncertainties, the
<b>Floyd</b> | internecine conflicts, the inevitable fragmentation and
<b>Floyd</b> | factionalization. And you have learned of the necessities the Apostasy
<b>Floyd</b> | serves: what they defend against and what they preserve.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your own experiences with the Apostasy and the empire it has formed
<b>Floyd</b> | have ranged from the seeming hostile (your initial removal from what
<b>Floyd</b> | you thought was your community) to the benign (the strictures and
<b>Floyd</b> | supports that defined your daily life) to the outright positive (the
<b>Floyd</b> | friendships you have made and the life you have found within the

<b>Floyd</b> | There is nothing written here of the town, but there is an entry on
<b>Floyd</b> | the entity known as Mors Diahl, whose ending carved the valley at its
<b>Floyd</b> | mountain's base. The entry notes that the single entity might have
<b>Floyd</b> | been a merging of two - Mors and Diahl - as the entity's imagery
<b>Floyd</b> | included elements of duality. Apostatic historians are uncertain if
<b>Floyd</b> | this was an original mythology to the region, or the merging of two

<b>Floyd</b> | You have not been lucid since your last night in the capital. Part of
<b>Floyd</b> | you wondered if you ever would be again. But as the walls of the hut
<b>Floyd</b> | fade from view, you feel yourself falling to that place that lies at
<b>Floyd</b> | the center of your being. Then, with the smooth transition of a dream,
<b>Floyd</b> | all about you arises the endless expanse of...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">The Empty Quarter</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | It has been grey here for as long as you can remember. You think it
<b>Floyd</b> | was before they taught you of it, when you came here without knowledge
<b>Floyd</b> | of what it was. The featureless expanse reaches from horizon to
<b>Floyd</b> | horizon, the grey above it only slightly lighter than the grey below.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You sense more than see the slight perturbations in the plane, one in
<b>Floyd</b> | each of what you think of as the cardinal directions. Three - north,
<b>Floyd</b> | east, and west - are morphological: an echo of Diahl to the west, a
<b>Floyd</b> | memory of home to the north, and...to the east -- yes, it definitely
<b>Floyd</b> | is. The familiar sensation of Silenus.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To the south lies a grey sea, making itself visible only in its
<b>Floyd</b> | motion. Your true body and the emptiness of sleep lies in its waiting
<b>Floyd</b> | arms.

<b>Floyd</b> | Here the grey lightens and hardens until it is pure white marble
<b>Floyd</b> | beneath your feet, inlaid with precious stones and pieces of mirror. A
<b>Floyd</b> | raised path, also of marble, leads to the center. Beyond it, to the
<b>Floyd</b> | east, five arches are sketched into perilous existence.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The path ends in a platform of deep red brick, topped in marble. Upon
<b>Floyd</b> | the platform is a wrought iron table.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Seated at the table, as if nothing has happened and no time has
<b>Floyd</b> | passed, sits Silenus, shuffling and laying out a deck of cards.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "That was hardly subtle, now was it?", it says, looking up from its

<b>Floyd</b> | cluttered beyond comprehension: certainties, biases, treasures and
<b>Floyd</b> | trash and failures and successes of all kinds. Through long study and
<b>Floyd</b> | a good deal of work, you slowly cleared it all, from the attics down
<b>Floyd</b> | to the deepest sub-basement. Then you began the task of dismantling
<b>Floyd</b> | the building itself...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">The House</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | There is nothing here, really, but the idea of a home. It most closely
<b>Floyd</b> | resembles a hastily drawn sketch of the Brotherhood's Hall, back in
<b>Floyd</b> | the capital. Perhaps someday there will be something more to see here:
<b>Floyd</b> | some memory to turn over and examine, some problem or conundrum to
<b>Floyd</b> | consider. But for now, the emptiness of the place feels like a very
<b>Floyd</b> | good thing, indeed.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You pause to hide behind a tree.  You can hear the orc crashing
<b>Floyd</b> | through the underbrush searching for its prey, you.  Eluding them
<b>Floyd</b> | since they attacked your village, you hoped to lead them away from the
<b>Floyd</b> | others while trying to keep out of their cooking pot yourself.  You
<b>Floyd</b> | try to control your breathing as you rest for a moment, but you doubt
<b>Floyd</b> | it can hear it through all the noise it's making.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Suddenly from behind, two arms like tree branches reach out and grab
<b>Floyd</b> | for you.  You slice out with your hunting the knife, the only weapon
<b>Floyd</b> | you managed to grab on your flight out, cutting deeply but not doing
<b>Floyd</b> | any real damage.  The orc keeps hold and slings you over its shoulder
<b>Floyd</b> | and begins to traipse back through the forest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Suddenly it stops, sniffing the air when suddenly you smell something
<b>Floyd</b> | too.  A smell you know oh too well. A flowery scent, one that strikes
<b>Floyd</b> | fear into the heart of any creature, large or small.  The orc drops
<b>Floyd</b> | you where he stands and runs off in a panic, leaving you lying there.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The world begins to blur as the smell becomes stronger, you suddenly
<b>Floyd</b> | realize that it's all been a dream and the orc attacking your village
<b>Floyd</b> | was nothing more than a result of some late night tacos.  But that
<b>Floyd</b> | smell is one all too real.  The perfume your wife wears every day,
<b>Floyd</b> | announcing her presence as she enters the bedroom you share.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Will you get out of bed!!!", she screeches.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You promised you'd get rid of that hornets' nest before my mother got
<b>Floyd</b> | here.  You know she's allergic."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You slowly roll out of bed, you had secretly hoped that perhaps your
<b>Floyd</b> | mother-in-law would get stung and never come back.  But your fear of
<b>Floyd</b> | your wife is stronger than your desire to see her mother disappear.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Getting up you manage to pull on your shorts and a t-shirt before she
<b>Floyd</b> | shoves you out the door.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Now don't come back until it's gone, " she demands as she slams and

<b>Floyd</b> | scouts, you hold them at just the right angle so the sunlight makes a
<b>Floyd</b> | pinpoint on the twigs.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After a few moments a small stream of smoke rises from the twigs and
<b>Floyd</b> | then suddenly a flame appears.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The can sits in the fire for a few moments and then it starts to turn
<b>Floyd</b> | a hot red as it heats up.  As the sides of the can start to bulge out
<b>Floyd</b> | at the center, you quickly decide it's time to hide behind the tree.
<b>Floyd</b> | Just as you retreat behind the tree, you hear a large explosion and
<b>Floyd</b> | you hit the ground.  You hear a whistle as the exploded can flies
<b>Floyd</b> | towards the nest hitting it right in the bottom, plugging up the
<b>Floyd</b> | entrance to the nest.

<b>Floyd</b> | *** Here ends the intro to Hornet's Nest.  I hope you
<b>Floyd</b> | enjoyed this introduction to this piece.  I plan to add more ways to
<b>Floyd</b> | try and achieve your goal of removing the nest from the tree.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ** You've managed to annoy the hornets in the following ways: spraying
<b>Floyd</b> | the nest with bug spray, using heavy smoke to remove the hornets,
<b>Floyd</b> | cutting the branch the nest is on out of the tree and blowing up the
<b>Floyd</b> | can of spray. ***
