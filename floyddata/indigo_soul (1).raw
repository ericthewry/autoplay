The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>The Indigo New Language Speed IFs</i>, which were written by various authors.  You can learn more about these games, including how to download them, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Indigo_New_Language_Speed-IF'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing these games, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played these games, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b><I>ANOTHER</I> WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> A lot (most!) of the transcripts contained on this site are, shall we say, family-friendly.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Ephraim is familiar; you've traveled with him before. He has made
<b>Floyd</b> |  this journey to the East in the past, making him unique among your

<b>Floyd</b> |  as sharp as ever. He never misses a deal, or a danger.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Alexander, son of Asa, is an unfamiliar face, but you've heard of
<b>Floyd</b> |  him in the few weeks you've spent in this place. Tales of his exploits
<b>Floyd</b> |  and outburts in local gambling dens and seedier locales quickly made
<b>Floyd</b> |  him notorious among your small group of outsider mechants, not to
<b>Floyd</b> |  mention the natives. He looks very young, and seems to wear a
<b>Floyd</b> |  perpetual scowl.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Yishai is another matter. Yes, he adorns himself with clothes of many
<b>Floyd</b> |  different colors; you might even call it ostentatious. But he hides

<b>Floyd</b> | Memories, that fuzzy affair. You're never certain enough how true they

<b>Floyd</b> | speculation about monsters in the basement... But the thing I really
<b>Floyd</b> | remember from that summer holidays is our  improbable and quite not
<b>Floyd</b> | balanced friendship trio.
<b>Floyd</b> | There was Doc. Brown, thin, handsome, annoyingly arrogant every now and
<b>Floyd</b> | then, always the charismatic. Then there was Rose, shy, with the soft,
<b>Floyd</b> | delicate look under her golden hair. The three of us united by the bare
<b>Floyd</b> | fact that we were the only people of our age in that too quiet, too
<b>Floyd</b> | boring, village, wasting the best of our late teens during the early
<b>Floyd</b> | eighties.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Now, Mike, I entitle you as Carrier of the Torch" solemny joked Rose
<b>Floyd</b> | when giving me the thing that dry, hot late summer evening when, just
<b>Floyd</b> | out of having nothing else to do, we decided to play kids and go to

<b>Floyd</b> | PL..." no... "PLE"... wait, "PLO"...
<b>Floyd</b> |  Damn, I couldn't understand that. Paper was so crumbled and the
<b>Floyd</b> | handwritting was so old-fashioned and weird...
<b>Floyd</b> | Suddenly Doc took the paper off from my hands with a mocking remark
<b>Floyd</b> | "You! silly mikie, didn't they teach you to read properly? Lemme see
<b>Floyd</b> | "Magic word: say PL..."
<b>Floyd</b> | I wouldn't allow that. I was used to his disdainful jokes in front of
<b>Floyd</b> | Rose, but enough was enough. I removed the paper from him with an
<b>Floyd</b> | abrupt gest, and then...
<b>Floyd</b> | ... then, showing a side of herself neither Doc nor me had ever seen
<b>Floyd</b> | before, Rose took it away from me with an exhasperated look "Cm'on
<b>Floyd</b> | kids! Will you at least try to fake some mature behaviour in the
<b>Floyd</b> | presence of a lady! Let's see, Magic word: say... PLUGH"
<b>Floyd</b> | ...and then... PLOF!
<b>Floyd</b> | ...she just dissapeared in a cloud of smoke. Before we could react, her
<b>Floyd</b> | scream could be heard from somewhere inside the house. Doc just kicked
<b>Floyd</b> | the door, which opened with a suspicious ease now, and hurried into the
<b>Floyd</b> | mansion, so worried to show he was in charge that he forgot I was
<b>Floyd</b> | carrying the torch. I followed, but could only be aware, to my regret,

<b>Floyd</b> | could just refer as ghosts. At the other end of the corridor Doc stood
<b>Floyd</b> | defiantly carrying a shining sword "Now, minions of hell, you're going

<b>Floyd</b> | "Yiaaaahhh...!! CRASH!!
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ouch... That must have hurt!!" I thought, and looked into the hole to

<b>Floyd</b> | "It's okay, it's okay" he said "It's been just some scrapes... You're

<b>Floyd</b> | loneliness... and then the cold, the death...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ...and for the very first time in my life, I was slapped by a ghost.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Not only slapped as beeing hit in your cheek, but also as beeing
<b>Floyd</b> | grabbed in the air, literally kicked in the ass, and thrown away by a
<b>Floyd</b> | closed window.
<b>Floyd</b> | First I panicked, about the other world sighting and that stuff. I
<b>Floyd</b> | closed my eyes, but soon I couldn't help opening them again and I saw I
<b>Floyd</b> | was landing into the entrance of the house, where Rose and Doc were
<b>Floyd</b> | just dumbstruck watching my freefall from the first floor.
<b>Floyd</b> | ...CRASH!
<b>Floyd</b> | "..Ouch! That must have hurt!" Rose's comforting voice received me

<b>Floyd</b> | thought you would throw yourself through a window just if someone
<b>Floyd</b> | suggested you to do, now I know you would do it even if no one told you
<b>Floyd</b> | so!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And that was all about the house mystery; there was no mystery at all,
<b>Floyd</b> | at least not the way I thought about mysteries since then. The mansion
<b>Floyd</b> | was abandoned when rich heiress powerful dumb airhead Shirley McDaniel
<b>Floyd</b> | fell in love with a married man. There were no monsters in the
<b>Floyd</b> | basement, but I met a ghost in the attic. She happened to be just a
<b>Floyd</b> | random squatter called Indigo, and was there for the same reason ghosts
<b>Floyd</b> | like to roam quiet isolated places. They are empty, giving them time to
<b>Floyd</b> | heal whatever wounds tie them to the wrong side of the after-life...
<b>Floyd</b> | alone...
<b>Floyd</b> | Rose and Doc helped me to stand, each to one side of me, while my leg
<b>Floyd</b> | hurted like hell, just a bad sprain. I enjoyed that brief moment in the
<b>Floyd</b> | centre of our improbable friendship trio, whose balance, I knew then,
<b>Floyd</b> | was as close to an irreversible end as summer itself... The following
<b>Floyd</b> | days we had trouble discerning real events from ghost pranks. Now I'm

<b>Floyd</b> | using a programming language they haven't published in before.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I only had a couple of afternoons to give this project, and there's
<b>Floyd</b> | lots I would like to have done better.  As with all speed-IF, this is
<b>Floyd</b> | an unfinished design with minimal implementation.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Still, it was a fun time, and I owe a lot to Eric Eve's manuals and
<b>Floyd</b> | tour guide for making it possible to implement even as much as I was
<b>Floyd</b> | able to here, given that I was coming to the language as an almost
<b>Floyd</b> | complete novice.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is possible to make the game unfinishable, but typically only by
<b>Floyd</b> | destroying an object.  It should be immediately obvious when an object
<b>Floyd</b> | is destroyed.  Hints are available, though like everything else, they
<b>Floyd</b> | may be flawed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally: if in doubt about removing one object from another, try TAKE.
<b>Floyd</b> | Other variations ('get foo from bar', 'remove foo from bar', etc.) are
<b>Floyd</b> | not necessarily as well accounted-for as they should be.

<b>Floyd</b> | THE SINGULAR ADVENTURE OF THE INDIGO VIOLET
<b>Floyd</b> | From the reminiscences of John H. Watson
<b>Floyd</b> |    adapted by David Fletcher
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I do not think, Watson," said my friend, "that you have ever placed
<b>Floyd</b> | before the
<b>Floyd</b> | public the facts of the case we investigated in the year 18--, in which
<b>Floyd</b> | the
<b>Floyd</b> | indigo violet was so deeply concerned."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Indeed not," I replied.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The case was a simple one, of course, but --"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Simple, Holmes!" I expostulated. "Really I do not see how it could be
<b>Floyd</b> | called
<b>Floyd</b> | simple."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Exceptionally so in one respect, Watson: that only the killer was
<b>Floyd</b> | discovered
<b>Floyd</b> | to have been lying. The other witnesses recounted the facts with a
<b>Floyd</b> | pleasing
<b>Floyd</b> | exactitude and honesty."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I recalled that Holmes, after a brief examination of the scene, had
<b>Floyd</b> | asked the
<b>Floyd</b> | persons concerned only about each other and about those few rooms and
<b>Floyd</b> | items
<b>Floyd</b> | that were involved, and yet by the application of his remarkable
<b>Floyd</b> | deductive
<b>Floyd</b> | faculty had soon been able to accuse the guilty person.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now it's Sam's gentle laugh.  A little worn, like some of the spark is
<b>Floyd</b> | gone, but I guess after all these years we've all lost a little of our

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | In Memory was written by Jacqueline A Lott for the 2011 Indigo New
<b>Floyd</b> | Language Speed IF.  This was a "speed IF" where you were given about
<b>Floyd</b> | three weeks to write a game in an interactive fiction language you'd
<b>Floyd</b> | never used before.  I did spend a fair amount of the allotted time
<b>Floyd</b> | working on In Memory, though not nearly as much as I could have (my
<b>Floyd</b> | real life was also fairly busy those three weeks).  It received some
<b>Floyd</b> | light testing from Sam Kabo Ashwell (thanks, maga!).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My thanks to Duncan Bowsman for making me think about ADRIFT.  Without
<b>Floyd</b> | Bowsman, I probably wouldn't have sprung the ADRIFT Generator or been
<b>Floyd</b> | curious about how to create games with it.  Thanks also to Campbell
<b>Floyd</b> | Wild for the system itself, the stellar documentation he's written for
<b>Floyd</b> | it,  and his really great customer service.  I'm glad I chose ADRIFT
<b>Floyd</b> | for this speed-IF -- much as I'm a fan of I7, this might not be my last
<b>Floyd</b> | foray into ADRIFTland.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As for the game itself, this is actually a game I'd been thinking about
<b>Floyd</b> | for some time, but which I thought would be too overambitious.  Then I
<b>Floyd</b> | went and crammed the whole thing into two weeks of work.  Sensible,
<b>Floyd</b> | right?  It was, unshockingly, too much to do for a SpeedIF.  I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | pleased enough with it, though, and I am not opposed to doing a second
<b>Floyd</b> | release of this, so if you encounter things you think should be added,
<b>Floyd</b> | please send a note to my gmail account: jacqueline.a.lott
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Oh, and if you're curious about some of the stats about the game, you
<b>Floyd</b> | can type &gt;STATS, but I'd wait until you've played through at least one
<b>Floyd</b> | full time before you check those out.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks for playing.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | For the curious and terminally geeky, the game lets you associate well
<b>Floyd</b> | over two thousand words with the various memories you encounter.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | actual number is unknown, given that the game (for obvious reasons)
<b>Floyd</b> | makes heavy, heavy use of wildcards in text input.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Holding onto the Bunny allows over 170 word associations, grouped into
<b>Floyd</b> | 10 categories.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | School Days allows over 225 word associations, grouped into 12
<b>Floyd</b> | categories.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Homecoming Night allows over 130 word associations, grouped into 8
<b>Floyd</b> | categories.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Loving Sam allows over 400 word associations, grouped into 21
<b>Floyd</b> | categories.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lost in Sound allows over 150 word associations, grouped into 14
<b>Floyd</b> | categories.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Imagined Realities allows over 50 word associations, grouped into 15
<b>Floyd</b> | categories.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Vista Back Home allows over 80 word associations, grouped into 13
<b>Floyd</b> | categories.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For the Indigo New Language Speed IF release of In Memory (i.e. the
<b>Floyd</b> | first (and possibly only (we'll see))) release, the only category of
<b>Floyd</b> | these that can change the end cut scene are the words you associate
<b>Floyd</b> | with your old lover, Sam.  While there are 21 categories, there are
<b>Floyd</b> | fewer endings than that because many of the categores -- particularly
<b>Floyd</b> | the, shall we say, more primal categories -- closely overlap.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As for the other memories and all of their categories, this version of
<b>Floyd</b> | the game does keep track of which category of word associations you
<b>Floyd</b> | chose, but doesn't integrate them into the end game.  Such is the way
<b>Floyd</b> | of the Speed IF: I ran out of time.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On a final note, a feelie of sorts.  If you want to see the horribly
<b>Floyd</b> | messy (and terribly spoilery) design document, there's a photo of it at
