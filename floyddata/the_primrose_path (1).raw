The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>The Primrose Path</i>, written by Nolan Bonvouloir.  <I>The Primrose Path</I> was originally released as part of the 2006 IF Competition, where it took 2nd place.  It also garnered Xyzzy nominations for Best Game and Best Individual PC.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/The_Primrose_Path'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | It's been a bad night. I think I finally struggled into sleep at
<b>Floyd</b> | something like half-past two, and since then it's been more or less a
<b>Floyd</b> | continuous string of nightmares. Time and again I dream of Leo,
<b>Floyd</b> | standing at the end of a distant cliff, peering down over the edge. I
<b>Floyd</b> | run towards him, shouting at random, trying to warn him---willing to
<b>Floyd</b> | say anything, so long as it reaches his ears. But inevitably, just as
<b>Floyd</b> | I am near enough for him to hear my voice, a bell sounds from
<b>Floyd</b> | somewhere above us, and he doesn't turn. And then suddenly he is gone
<b>Floyd</b> | over the cliff's edge, and the entire world is going white, nothing
<b>Floyd</b> | remaining but me, the cliff, and the sound of the bell ringing, and
<b>Floyd</b> | ringing, and ringing . . .

<b>Floyd</b> | What until last week was my main living space is at the moment a

<b>Floyd</b> | Currently the only thing I've put back up is another of Leo's
<b>Floyd</b> | paintings, on the west wall. The front door, the source of all the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And yet, here it is, much colder here than back home. There's a sheer

<b>Floyd</b> | what the Eiffel Tower is to Paris. No tourists here today, though; the

<b>Floyd</b> | A sudden noise behind me, and I turn and see Leo, painting in the main

<b>Floyd</b> | the room. "Did you find the key?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When I hold up the box, his face morphs into the happiest expression I
<b>Floyd</b> | have ever seen on a human face. "Irene!" he cries. "I . . . you . . .
<b>Floyd</b> | " and he pulls me into a fierce hug. After a few moments of this, I
<b>Floyd</b> | pull back, and his expression turns solemn. "And there's something I
<b>Floyd</b> | need to ask---"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He is interrupted by a distant scream. In the background I can hear
<b>Floyd</b> | Irene's voice floating up the stairs. "Leo?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He rolls his eyes, then shouts back, "Coming!" Then, turning to me:
<b>Floyd</b> | "We'll talk in a second. Wait for me." He gently takes the box from my

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I simply stand there for a moment, basking in the warm glow of my own

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Too long. I took too damn long.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Abruptly, the door swings open, revealing Irene.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I hope you're happy!" she shouts, her voice loud enough to give me
<b>Floyd</b> | the queerest sense that she is addressing not me, but at someone
<b>Floyd</b> | directly behind me. "This is what comes of your meddling!" But before
<b>Floyd</b> | she can continue, we are both distracted by a deafening creak from the
<b>Floyd</b> | staircase.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We turn in unison to see a familiar woman in a fuchsia nightgown
<b>Floyd</b> | descending the stairs. It's with an odd sense of resignation that I
<b>Floyd</b> | find myself meeting her eyes, then looking away, ashamed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Irene's own eyes, meanwhile, are travelling thoughtfully from one of
<b>Floyd</b> | us to the other. "I see," she says. "So you don't know how the
<b>Floyd</b> | paintings work after all. Putting yourself in a position where you
<b>Floyd</b> | might meet your former self? Rarely a good idea." With trembling
<b>Floyd</b> | hands, she raises the gun to point at me. "You'll forgive me,
<b>Floyd</b> | Matilda," she says, "but I can't help holding you responsible for
<b>Floyd</b> | what's become of Leo. This is, unfortunately, the best way to avoid
<b>Floyd</b> | unpleasant property disputes." She nods to my former self. "Run up and
<b>Floyd</b> | call 9-9-9, quickly."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When I hold up the box, his face morphs into the happiest expression I

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He is interrupted by a distant scream. In the background I can hear

<b>Floyd</b> | He rolls his eyes, then shouts back, "Coming!" Then, turning to me:
<b>Floyd</b> | "We'll talk in a second. Wait for me." He gently takes the box from my

<b>Floyd</b> | directly behind me. "This is what comes of your meddling!" But before
<b>Floyd</b> | she can continue, we are both distracted by a deafening creak from the
<b>Floyd</b> | staircase.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We turn in unison to see a familiar woman in a fuchsia nightgown
<b>Floyd</b> | descending the stairs. It's with an odd sense of resignation that I
<b>Floyd</b> | find myself meeting her eyes, then looking away, ashamed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Irene's own eyes, meanwhile, are travelling thoughtfully from one of
<b>Floyd</b> | us to the other. "I see," she says. "So you don't know how the
<b>Floyd</b> | paintings work after all. Putting yourself in a position where you
<b>Floyd</b> | might meet your former self? Rarely a good idea." With trembling
<b>Floyd</b> | hands, she raises the gun to point at me. "You'll forgive me,
<b>Floyd</b> | Matilda," she says, "but I can't help holding you responsible for
<b>Floyd</b> | what's become of Leo. This is, unfortunately, the best way to avoid
<b>Floyd</b> | unpleasant property disputes." She nods to my former self. "Run up and
<b>Floyd</b> | call 9-9-9, quickly."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then she fires.

<b>Floyd</b> | A sudden, tremendous report that dies away, leaving a preternatural
<b>Floyd</b> | silence nearly as quiet as the ones induced by Leo's pocketwatch.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Too long. I took too damn long.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Abruptly, the door swings open, revealing Irene.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I hope you're happy!" she shouts, her voice loud enough to give me
<b>Floyd</b> | the queerest sense that she is addressing not me, but at someone
<b>Floyd</b> | directly behind me. "This is what comes of your meddling!" But before
<b>Floyd</b> | she can continue, we are both distracted by a deafening creak from the
<b>Floyd</b> | staircase.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We turn in unison to see a familiar woman in a fuchsia nightgown
<b>Floyd</b> | descending the stairs. It's with an odd sense of resignation that I
<b>Floyd</b> | find myself meeting her eyes, then looking away, ashamed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Irene's own eyes, meanwhile, are travelling thoughtfully from one of
<b>Floyd</b> | us to the other. "I see," she says. "So you don't know how the
<b>Floyd</b> | paintings work after all. Putting yourself in a position where you
<b>Floyd</b> | might meet your former self? Rarely a good idea." With trembling
<b>Floyd</b> | hands, she raises the gun to point at me. "You'll forgive me,
<b>Floyd</b> | Matilda," she says, "but I can't help holding you responsible for
<b>Floyd</b> | what's become of Leo. This is, unfortunately, the best way to avoid
<b>Floyd</b> | unpleasant property disputes." She nods to my former self. "Run up and
<b>Floyd</b> | call 9-9-9, quickly."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then she fires.

<b>Floyd</b> | What until last week was my main living space is at the moment a
<b>Floyd</b> | complete disaster. The walls are painted a sickly turquoise, new as of
<b>Floyd</b> | two days ago, and all the furniture is still covered with plastic.
<b>Floyd</b> | Currently the only thing I've put back up is another of Leo's
<b>Floyd</b> | paintings, on the west wall. The front door lies to the southwest. The
<b>Floyd</b> | stairs up to the bedroom are to the east, the kitchen north.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I hear a soft sound from the corner. Turning, I nearly jump out of my
<b>Floyd</b> | skin to see Irene standing at the bottom of the staircase, holding her
<b>Floyd</b> | hands clasped behind her back and staring at me in a peculiar way.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, hello, Matilda," she says. "I didn't think you were up yet."

<b>Floyd</b> | good time of year for me, which I think had more to do with my
<b>Floyd</b> | reaction than I thought at the time. Also, Leo took me by surprise;
<b>Floyd</b> | never a good idea. We were sitting in my living room, just as always,
<b>Floyd</b> | and was saying something about how he'd tried answering someone's
<b>Floyd</b> | personal advertisement in the paper and it had gone flamingly badly;
<b>Floyd</b> | he was upset because the woman thought he'd misrepresented his age.
<b>Floyd</b> | Fairly standard Leo existential angst, in fact.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I used to want to go as long as possible without settling down," he
<b>Floyd</b> | finished, "because from what I could see most people in relationships
<b>Floyd</b> | spent half their time wanting out; I didn't realise that once I was
<b>Floyd</b> | permanently single I'd be spending most of my time wanting in."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I've already decided to be an old spinster," I said. "For the common
<b>Floyd</b> | good, really. Someone needs to break down the stereotype that we're
<b>Floyd</b> | all genteel, ancient ladies with thousands of cats."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You don't need to put such a bright face on it," he said. "Not with
<b>Floyd</b> | me. You must be so lonely."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On any other day I would have been furious with this bit of
<b>Floyd</b> | effrontery, but on this particular day as it happens he wasn't so far
<b>Floyd</b> | off. "Sometimes."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "More than that."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Sometimes," I said firmly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "More than sometimes. For me, anyway. What's the good of voluntarily
<b>Floyd</b> | staying on your own when are people out there who'd be willing to link
<b>Floyd</b> | their lives with yours, if only you'd ask? There's not enough time
<b>Floyd</b> | left to justify wasting any of it away longing out windows."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "That's true," I said, and in truth it was exactly what I'd been
<b>Floyd</b> | thinking earlier that afternoon. "But if the right person doesn't
<b>Floyd</b> | come, he doesn't come."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Will you marry me?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I was shocked, even though in retrospect he must have had this entire
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation mapped out in advance. But more than that I was repulsed
<b>Floyd</b> | that he would act like this was such a casual act, arising from
<b>Floyd</b> | convenience, or better yet from jealousy, fear that I might default to
<b>Floyd</b> | someone else. And the fact that he had the ring all ready made it ten
<b>Floyd</b> | thousand times worse. Did he really think it would be that easy? He
<b>Floyd</b> | must have bought it on his way back from his disastrous little date, a
<b>Floyd</b> | thousand-pound ego boost in a little box. Pathetic, really. But at the
<b>Floyd</b> | time I felt nothing but fury.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Put that away, Leo."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Listen a second before you decide: this ring---"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My voice did not break, I'm relieved to say. Instead I stood up and
<b>Floyd</b> | said, "You'd better go."

<b>Floyd</b> | hanging on the wall there at that point---we stared at this artwork
<b>Floyd</b> | for most of the evening. "How can they have done this?" I said,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It's for the greater good, Matilda. Gardens can be rebuilt. We're

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Will we?" He paused for a moment. "What if you had to choose four out

<b>Floyd</b> | neighbourhood next week.  Heard on the wireless this morning that the
<b>Floyd</b> | gardens have gone up in flames: arson, they're saying, or looters.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I spent all day today staring at the painting I finished in the
<b>Floyd</b> | gardens, but I'm afraid of what could happen if I actually used it. I
<b>Floyd</b> | could have lost the key anytime that morning, and if I couldn't find
<b>Floyd</b> | it I'd have no way to get back here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Damn it. Will give the painting to Matilda---she'll appreciate it and
<b>Floyd</b> | I won't have to think about it anymore.

<b>Floyd</b> | I think Irene knows where I've hidden the gun; I caught her sneaking

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At this point it serves me right even if she does find it. Helped

<b>Floyd</b> | gave the gallery key to Irene and told her to keep it safe somewhere

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A sudden, tremendous report that dies away, leaving a preternatural
<b>Floyd</b> | silence nearly as quiet as the ones induced by Leo's pocketwatch.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Too long. I took too damn long.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Abruptly, the door swings open, revealing Irene.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I hope you're happy!" she shouts, her voice loud enough to give me
<b>Floyd</b> | the queerest sense that she is addressing not me, but at someone
<b>Floyd</b> | directly behind me. "This is what comes of your meddling!" But before
<b>Floyd</b> | she can continue, we are both distracted by a deafening creak from the
<b>Floyd</b> | staircase.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We turn in unison to see a familiar woman in a fuchsia nightgown
<b>Floyd</b> | descending the stairs. It's with an odd sense of resignation that I
<b>Floyd</b> | find myself meeting her eyes, then looking away, ashamed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Irene's own eyes, meanwhile, are travelling thoughtfully from one of
<b>Floyd</b> | us to the other. "I see," she says. "So you don't know how the
<b>Floyd</b> | paintings work after all. Putting yourself in a position where you
<b>Floyd</b> | might meet your former self? Rarely a good idea." With trembling
<b>Floyd</b> | hands, she raises the gun to point at me. "You'll forgive me,
<b>Floyd</b> | Matilda," she says, "but I can't help holding you responsible for
<b>Floyd</b> | what's become of Leo. This is, unfortunately, the best way to avoid
<b>Floyd</b> | unpleasant property disputes." She nods to my former self. "Run up and
<b>Floyd</b> | call 9-9-9, quickly."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then she fires.

<b>Floyd</b> | Porch (in monochrome)
<b>Floyd</b> | Leo's porch is decidedly less congenial in the dark. There's not
<b>Floyd</b> | enough light inside to make out what's happening in Leo's kitchen, to
<b>Floyd</b> | the southeast, and even the gardens just east of here are shrouded in
<b>Floyd</b> | shadow.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A sudden noise: I turn. Leo has emerged from the house onto the porch,
<b>Floyd</b> | the pocketwatch in his hand. I retreat into the shadows; he doesn't
<b>Floyd</b> | see me.

<b>Floyd</b> | Irene emerges stealthily from the open slider, a gun clutched in her

<b>Floyd</b> | painting in the garden, pocketwatch in hand.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Don't move!" shouts Irene. I freeze, but she hasn't seen me; she

<b>Floyd</b> | Her voice is steady.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The look on Leo's face isn't the horror I expect---in fact, he looks

<b>Floyd</b> | Cliff's Edge
<b>Floyd</b> | I am momentarily disoriented as my head fills with the roar of water.
<b>Floyd</b> | I open my eyes to mist, positioned by a cliff which comes to a point
<b>Floyd</b> | some distance ahead of me. The vista beyond the cliff is dominated by
<b>Floyd</b> | the waterfall, unnaturally close behind, so near that it's utterly
<b>Floyd</b> | impossible to see anything beyond it. Up at the far edge is Leo,
<b>Floyd</b> | leaning dangerously over the falls.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Leo!" I shout. But of course he can't hear me with the water as loud
<b>Floyd</b> | as it is. He's drawn these falls from his imagination, and they are
<b>Floyd</b> | far larger than anything I can conceive of in the real world, the
<b>Floyd</b> | water falling from a point far above our heads, and dissolving into
<b>Floyd</b> | mist far below, the cloud of mist so large it becomes impossible to
<b>Floyd</b> | see anything in the distance---there is only water, me, Leo and a line
<b>Floyd</b> | of small yellow flowers that seems to be thriving in the mist off the
<b>Floyd</b> | falls.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I begin running toward him. "Leo! Wait for me!" But my voice seems to
<b>Floyd</b> | be unable to carry. And, then, suddenly, a bell rings overhead. I
<b>Floyd</b> | continue to run, the motion slower and slower, but now I am perplexed.

<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room
<b>Floyd</b> | What until last week was my main living space is at the moment a
<b>Floyd</b> | complete disaster. The walls are painted a sickly turquoise, new as of
<b>Floyd</b> | two days ago, and all the furniture is still covered with plastic.
<b>Floyd</b> | Currently the only thing I've put back up is another of Leo's
<b>Floyd</b> | paintings, on the west wall. The front door lies to the southwest. The
<b>Floyd</b> | stairs up to the bedroom are to the east, the kitchen north.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I hear a soft sound from the corner. Turning, I nearly jump out of my
<b>Floyd</b> | skin to see Irene standing at the bottom of the staircase, holding her
<b>Floyd</b> | hands clasped behind her back and staring at me in a peculiar way.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, hello, Matilda," she says. "I didn't think you were up yet."

<b>Floyd</b> | thing." She is interrupted by the sound of stairs being loudly
<b>Floyd</b> | descended: Leo.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I turn my attention to Irene, who has slipped off her bracelet and is
<b>Floyd</b> | pulling at it thoughtfully. Abruptly, she leans in to me and begins to
<b>Floyd</b> | whisper rapidly. "Listen. I'm sorry about the mistake with the key---I
<b>Floyd</b> | had no idea it would cause so much trouble. If you want to get it, I
<b>Floyd</b> | can distract him for you. But there won't be much time. If he can't

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Leo appears in the foyer, waving the pocketwatch wildly. "Irene," he

<b>Floyd</b> | to---"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I know, Leo. Come in here; there's something we need to discuss." But
<b>Floyd</b> | before she goes, she leans in close, squeezes my wrist, and whispers a

<b>Floyd</b> | The ring has reappeared on my ringer.
<b>Floyd</b> | The bracelet has reappeared on my wrist.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At my appearance, Leo stands, eyes wide. "Did you find the key?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When I hold up the box, his face morphs into the happiest expression I
<b>Floyd</b> | have ever seen on a human face. "Irene!" he cries. "I . . . you . . .
<b>Floyd</b> | " and he pulls me into a fierce hug. After a few moments of this, I
<b>Floyd</b> | pull back, and his expression turns solemn. "And there's something I
<b>Floyd</b> | need to ask---"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He is interrupted by a distant scream. In the background I can hear
<b>Floyd</b> | Irene's voice floating up the stairs. "Leo?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He rolls his eyes, then shouts back, "Coming!" Then, turning to me:
<b>Floyd</b> | "We'll talk in a second. Wait for me." He gently takes the box from my
<b>Floyd</b> | hands and zips out to the south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I wait for what seems like an appropriate length of time. Then I
<b>Floyd</b> | descend the stairs and arrive in the foyer just as my front door is
<b>Floyd</b> | opening.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | " . . . But it should be pretty easy to repair; I mean, sliders aren't
<b>Floyd</b> | especially complicated doors, and I know a lot about broken locks,"
<b>Floyd</b> | Leo is saying as he exits. He stops short on seeing me: "Matilda! How
<b>Floyd</b> | on earth did you get down here so fast, before? When I came down the
<b>Floyd</b> | stairs and saw you running into the front room I was completely
<b>Floyd</b> | flummoxed . . . "
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I shoot a surreptitious grateful nod at Irene, who smiles. "Apparently
<b>Floyd</b> | you two have a little explaining to do," she remarks, withdrawing into
<b>Floyd</b> | my flat. "I'll just leave you two to yourselves." The door shuts
<b>Floyd</b> | behind her with a soft click.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I am about to make a mordant comment about Irene's shamelessness, but

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And then he bends, awkwardly, to one knee, bringing himself to eye

<b>Floyd</b> | ring onto my finger. And, unexpectedly, he twists the diamond. All
<b>Floyd</b> | colour drains out of the room, and suddenly it's just the two of us,
<b>Floyd</b> | staring at each other.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For the first time I become aware of a sinking feeling, somewhere far
