<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    The hiking trip across Europe has been a wonderful experience for
<b>Floyd</b> | two recent college graduates like yourself and your friend Carolyn.
<b>Floyd</b> | From the mansions of England to the beaches of Greece, you've walked in
<b>Floyd</b> | the footsteps of the Crusaders and seen sights that few Americans have
<b>Floyd</b> | ever seen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Carolyn had wanted to skip the Central European nation of Rylvania.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Why bother?"  she'd said.  "There's nothing but farmers there, and
<b>Floyd</b> | creepy old castles - nothing we haven't seen already.  The Rylvanians
<b>Floyd</b> | are still living in the last century."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    That, you'd insisted, was exactly why Rylvania was a must-see.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | country was an intact piece of living history, a real treasure in this
<b>Floyd</b> | modern age.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    If only you hadn't insisted!  As night fell, as you approached a
<b>Floyd</b> | small farming village in search of a quaint inn to spend the night, the
<b>Floyd</b> | howling began.  A scant hundred yards from the village, and it
<b>Floyd</b> | happened...the wolves appeared from the black forest around you and
<b>Floyd</b> | attacked.  Big, black wolves that leaped for Carolyn's throat before
<b>Floyd</b> | you could shout a warning, led by a great gray-black animal that easily
<b>Floyd</b> | stood four feet at the shoulder.  Carolyn fell to the rocky path, blood
<b>Floyd</b> | gushing from her neck as the wolves faded back into the trees,
<b>Floyd</b> | unwilling, for some unknown reason, to press their attack.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    If she dies, it will be your fault.  You curse the darkening sky as
<b>Floyd</b> | you cradle Carolyn's head, knowing that you have little time to find
<b>Floyd</b> | help.  Perhaps in the village up the road to the north -

<b>Floyd</b> | Winding Path
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    The main road is a north-south trail - little more than a dirt path
<b>Floyd</b> | - winding through a black, dismal forest.  To the north, through the
<b>Floyd</b> | trees, you can barely make out the lights of a small Rylvanian village.
<b>Floyd</b> | The sun has just set and dark trees hang over the path, forming a
<b>Floyd</b> | mazelike net overhead.  The path is well trodden and easy to walk on.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Carolyn, your close friend from college, lies motionless on the
<b>Floyd</b> | path, blood flowing freely from a gaping, jagged wound in her throat
<b>Floyd</b> | and chest.  She's making faint gurgling sounds and just barely
<b>Floyd</b> | breathing.
