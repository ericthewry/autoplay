						The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each
						week at a pre-arranged time, a group of
						people meet online to cooperatively play
						a game of interactive fiction.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Darkiss 1: The Awakening</em> written by Marco Vallarino.
						It took twelfth place in the 2015 Interactive Fiction Competition. 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting

					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of

<b>Floyd</b> | Hidden in the bowels of the mountain, this chamber has hosted your
<b>Floyd</b> | immortal body for centuries, while your enemies spent their miserable
<b>Floyd</b> | days hunting you down at your castle. The coffin is on a stone
<b>Floyd</b> | pedestal at the centre of the room. On the ceiling is a fresco of the
<b>Floyd</b> | red sun of Valmar. To the east a narrow tunnel leads to the other
<b>Floyd</b> | rooms of your hideout.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You're lying in the coffin, very weak. You struggle to keep your eyes
<b>Floyd</b> | open, while your necrotic flesh is recovering its former appearance.
<b>Floyd</b> | You feel a stab of pain, when you remember the stake drove through
<b>Floyd</b> | your heart. You should be dead, but you aren't. Something happened.

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle input">&gt; INFO</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Here are the rules to play an interactive fiction:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | - Every command has to be inserted with the syntax verb + noun: &gt;get
<b>Floyd</b> | axe, &gt;open door, &gt;examine coffin, &gt;wear cloak, &gt;ask ghost about
<b>Floyd</b> | treasure, &gt;hit goblin...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | - To move from one place to another within the game world, you have
<b>Floyd</b> | to use the directions &gt;north (or just n), &gt;south (s), &gt;east (e), &gt;west
<b>Floyd</b> | (w), &gt;up (u), &gt;down (d).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | - The command &gt;inventory (i) prints the list of the objects you are

<b>Floyd</b> | information. By speaking with the other characters you can know what
<b>Floyd</b> | you have to do to obtain their help.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | - You can also ask for &gt;help to the game, &gt;save your progress on a
<b>Floyd</b> | file, &gt;restore it, or check your &gt;score.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My name is Marco Vallarino, I was born in 1977 in Imperia, where I
<b>Floyd</b> | live. I work as a journalist at the newspaper "Il Secolo XIX". I've
<b>Floyd</b> | written novels and short stories and I've published many books, but my
<b>Floyd</b> | real passion has always been interactive fiction. Since I was a kid,
<b>Floyd</b> | I've played tons of text adventures, in Italian and in English, and
<b>Floyd</b> | I've also tried writing some games, using first Qbasic and later on
<b>Floyd</b> | Inform 6.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My personal website is at www.marcovallarino.it and I also have a page
<b>Floyd</b> | at IF Wiki: ifwiki.org/index.php/Marco_Vallarino.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Darkiss 1" is my second attempt at translating a game from Italian to
<b>Floyd</b> | English, with the help of the editors and playtesters Emilio
<b>Floyd</b> | Audissino, Jacob Gunness, Marco Innocenti (who also designed the
<b>Floyd</b> | cover), Paolo Lucchesi, Ottavia Pesenti, who I truly thank for their
<b>Floyd</b> | fantastic support.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My other game available in English is the comedy "Save the Cheshire
<b>Floyd</b> | Cat!", which you can find at
<b>Floyd</b> | [<a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=j6purjagso6i5b0.">LINK</A>]
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I'll be glad if you let me know what you think about the style and the
<b>Floyd</b> | design of the game, writing to marco.vallarino@gmail.com.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For now, thanks for all the time you spend playing "Darkiss 1". Have
<b>Floyd</b> | fun!

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The first time you saw her was at a party thrown by your family to let
<b>Floyd</b> | you meet new people, in the hope that you would eventually meet the
<b>Floyd</b> | woman of your life. She came to the house in the evening, with a

<b>Floyd</b> | her unusual vivacity fascinated you immediately. The freshness of her
<b>Floyd</b> | appearance made her look very young, but she talked as if she were
<b>Floyd</b> | already highly experienced. When you finally managed to be alone with
<b>Floyd</b> | her, you took her hand for a walk in the woods, where nobody would
<b>Floyd</b> | disturb you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You thought that such an exuberant girl wouldn't have any objections
<b>Floyd</b> | about there in the woods, away from prying eyes. Instead it was her
<b>Floyd</b> | who took you. When you saw her eyes change their colour to red like
<b>Floyd</b> | two rubies and her cuspids become monstrously long fangs, it was too
<b>Floyd</b> | late to go back. However you are grateful to Lilith for not allowing
<b>Floyd</b> | you to run away. You could have never imagined the pleasure you felt
<b>Floyd</b> | when she pierced your neck with her teeth and sucked your blood almost
<b>Floyd</b> | to the last drop.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lilith disappeared right after, but she came back to meet you many
<b>Floyd</b> | other nights, in your house garden or directly in your room, when you
<b>Floyd</b> | would open the window and invite her to come in and drink your blood
<b>Floyd</b> | again. Even she grew fond of you: after drinking your blood for weeks,
<b>Floyd</b> | to prevent your death she decided to give you the dark gift that would
<b>Floyd</b> | turn you into an immortal night wanderer. Then she vanished forever,
<b>Floyd</b> | leaving you to your destiny with the memory of her fiery eyes and

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Stretching out your arms to receive the occult forces that you are
<b>Floyd</b> | going to summon, you recite the magic formula found among the graffiti
<b>Floyd</b> | in the cell. A mysterious sorcery that you didn't know before today.
<b>Floyd</b> | However, it seems to work well: when you finish to utter the words of
<b>Floyd</b> | the formula, Sabrina's ghost appears in front of you, exiting from the
<b>Floyd</b> | mouth of her corpse.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh, Martin!" exclaims the sepulchral apparition. "Have you seen what
<b>Floyd</b> | those bastards did to me? It was professor Anderson and his gang,
<b>Floyd</b> | those who already came to look for you at my village. They eventually
<b>Floyd</b> | found our hideout. They arrived to the camp in the morning. They were
<b>Floyd</b> | a lot and well-armed, your minions were taken by surprise and they
<b>Floyd</b> | were overpowered and slain in few hours."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I was spared only to suffer a worse fate" continues the spectre.
<b>Floyd</b> | "They knew who I was and said that I would have a special treatment.
<b>Floyd</b> | They ripped my clothes off and shaved my hair off, before whipping me
<b>Floyd</b> | and beating me up to allow me to 'expiate my sins'. Then they branded
<b>Floyd</b> | me with the vampire symbol. When they brought me here, I had gone
<b>Floyd</b> | through so much pain I couldn't stay on foot. Before burying me alive
<b>Floyd</b> | in the coffin, they forced me to attend your execution and that was
<b>Floyd</b> | the most horrible moment."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I tried to advise you of their coming" says Sabrina after a pause
<b>Floyd</b> | caused by the tension that those terrible memories still cause in her.
<b>Floyd</b> | "I shouted and shouted with all my breath, while we walked through the
<b>Floyd</b> | tunnel leading to your crypt. But you were sleeping, you couldn't wake
<b>Floyd</b> | up, so they killed you merciless. Now, seeing you alive again is a
<b>Floyd</b> | great joy for me because I'm sure that my death will be revenged
<b>Floyd</b> | together with yours and who did us wrong will die in horrible pain.
<b>Floyd</b> | Maybe, one day, you'll find the way to get me out of this damned
<b>Floyd</b> | place, where there's no escape from suffering and everything burns,
<b>Floyd</b> | burns, buuurns!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Suddenly Sabrina's corpse and the coffin catch fire in front of you,
<b>Floyd</b> | as if they have been reached by the same hell flames that tortured the
<b>Floyd</b> | girl's soul. While you look at the fire burning up, you seem to see
<b>Floyd</b> | Sabrina's spirit leave this reality to return to the netherworld.

<b>Floyd</b> | About the game, for your amusement, have your ever sung, swum, dug,
<b>Floyd</b> | sworn, licked the spikes of the iron maiden, entered the flaming

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The adventure of Martin Voigt continues to "Darkiss 2" while the main
<b>Floyd</b> | charachter of the spin-off "Sogno di Sangue" (tr. Blood Dream) is his
<b>Floyd</b> | enemy George Anderson. "Darkiss 3", the final chapter of the series,
<b>Floyd</b> | is work in progress. For now "Darkiss 2" and "Sogno di Sangue" are
<b>Floyd</b> | only available in Italian, but I would like to translate also them
<b>Floyd</b> | into English. If you can help to correct my translations and playtest
<b>Floyd</b> | the games, please, send me an email.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm waiting for you in the Crypt, bye!

<b>Floyd</b> | Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, give the FULL score
<b>Floyd</b> | for that game, see some suggestions for AMUSING things to do or QUIT?

<td class="interlude"><b>Jacqueline</b>  | Giordano Bruno (Italian: [dʒorˈdano ˈbruno]; Latin: Iordanus Brunus Nolanus; 1548 – 17 February 1600), born Filippo Bruno, was an Italian Dominican friar, philosopher, mathematician, poet, and astrologer.[3] He is celebrated for his cosmological theories, which went even further than the then novel Copernican model. He proposed that the stars were just distant suns surrounded by their own exoplanets and raised the possibility that these planets could even foster life of their own (a philosophical position known as cosmic pluralism). He also insisted that the universe is in fact infinite and could have no celestial body at its "center".

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Rather unusually, this time, as you've just started to repeat your

<b>Floyd</b> | speaking, emanating a diabolical halo of red light: "Martin Voigt, how
<b>Floyd</b> | much time has passed since the last time we met? Your death grieved me
<b>Floyd</b> | and I'm glad to have you in my sight again."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You smile, but Lilith frowns at you and says: "I know you're happy to

<b>Floyd</b> | who performed the magic that brought you to life, you're right. If you
<b>Floyd</b> | think I did it to allow you to accomplish your goal of revenge, you're
<b>Floyd</b> | wrong. I've a more ambitious and lethal project for you."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Unfortunately you still seem to be very weak" she continues. "I doubt

<b>Floyd</b> | another bit of help to let you recover your energy and leave your
