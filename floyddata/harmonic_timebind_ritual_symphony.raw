						The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each
						week at a pre-arranged time, a group of
						people meet online to cooperatively play
						a game of interactive fiction.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Harmonic Time-Bind Ritual Symphony</em> written by Ben Kidwell and Maevele Straw.
						It was released as part of the 2016 Spring Thing, Main Festival. 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting

					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing this game, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played this game, and think you might like to at some
						point, I do not recommend reading any further. Instead,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The full moon amidst clouds spills milky brightness everywhere. Summer
<b>Floyd</b> | is just barely over but the air is still warm and moist. Staci is
<b>Floyd</b> | standing on tip-toe, looking over the edge of the rooftops and
<b>Floyd</b> | treebranches. 'Oh! I can tell it's started,' she says. You stand up and
<b>Floyd</b> | walk across the porch, slipping your arm around her as you turn to
<b>Floyd</b> | watch the sky. What had been a low full circle wreathed by clouds is
<b>Floyd</b> | higher now and shinining clearly, but no longer full - darkness is
<b>Floyd</b> | creeping across the surface as the Moon swings into Earth's shadow. You
<b>Floyd</b> | peer upwards together, savoring the moment. The night air is sweet and
<b>Floyd</b> | warm, you are with someone you love...and the Castle is about to
<b>Floyd</b> | reopen.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You type the introduction of the game into the acme editor running on a
<b>Floyd</b> | Plan 9 cpu server via drawterm. Your ANTS-grid is operational again,
<b>Floyd</b> | finally. Outside, the moon is completely eclipsed, a shadowy phantom of
<b>Floyd</b> | its usual brilliance. You take a swallow of your half-full Moon Man
<b>Floyd</b> | beer and walk back out onto the porch. Around your neck, the Lunar
<b>Floyd</b> | Revolution Power Pendant resonates with the hum of the night; a slight
<b>Floyd</b> | breeze, crickets. The bridge to the west has been closed for weeks and
<b>Floyd</b> | everything has been quiet and still.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It has been two and a half years of lunacy since New Year's 2013, when
<b>Floyd</b> | you returned to Plan 9 software development. The VALISpectrum colors,
<b>Floyd</b> | the singing hippie housekeepers, the dock by the castle, Lunar
<b>Floyd</b> | Lightning and Astral Enchantments and the Afterlife - everything ensued
<b>Floyd</b> | from making the bind of fiction and reality that transformed you into

<b>Floyd</b> | (1 April 2013 - 30 months earlier)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After working obsessively since the New Year, you are finally ready to
<b>Floyd</b> | officially announce and release your software. You feel tense yet eager
<b>Floyd</b> | anticipation for the reaction from other Plan 9 users. When you are
<b>Floyd</b> | ready to unleash the Advanced Namespace Tools on the world, &gt;release
<b>Floyd</b> | ANTS.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Inside your house
<b>Floyd</b> | This is a modest one story house, cluttered by a decade of being lived
<b>Floyd</b> | in. Bookshelves line the walls. Your Plan 9 terminal is here, connected
<b>Floyd</b> | to the grid servers downstairs. Somewhere amidst the piles of books and
<b>Floyd</b> | papers is an upright piano.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see some bookshelves, a terminal and a piano here.

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | Harmonic Time-Bind Ritual Symphony is a game based on my spring and
<b>Floyd</b> | summer during 2013. During that time, I was able to experience my life
<b>Floyd</b> | as a work of interactive fiction created by a brilliant author. I felt
<b>Floyd</b> | that the nature of the quantum multiverse meant that it was true that I
<b>Floyd</b> | was a character in novels and songs and videogames in other universes,
<b>Floyd</b> | and I played my role to the hilt. I believed my manic madness was a
<b>Floyd</b> | gift which I could use for artistic creativity, and that my racing mind
<b>Floyd</b> | was fully up to solving the puzzles that the designer of my reality had
<b>Floyd</b> | laid out for me. It was the most glorious experience imaginable, and by
<b>Floyd</b> | the middle of the summer I felt like I was becoming a kind of Ultima
<b>Floyd</b> | IV-style Avatar of multiversal artistic consciousness and with just a
<b>Floyd</b> | little more spiritual insight and creative freedom, I'd be able to
<b>Floyd</b> | unlock the Vishnu-path Extra Arms upgrade for my character, which I
<b>Floyd</b> | might need in case the tentacle in the lake that was a whisker of
<b>Floyd</b> | Cthulhu's Moustache attacked.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game was created to share the wild, unbounded joy I felt in those
<b>Floyd</b> | months. Thanks to everyone who was a part of my life during that time,
<b>Floyd</b> | and thank you for playing this work of Interactive Fiction. Read &gt;help
<b>Floyd</b> | for important tips. &gt;design prints a spoiler-free essay on the design
<b>Floyd</b> | of the game.

<b>Floyd</b> | An important verb is the &gt;bind NAME NAME command from the Plan 9

<b>Floyd</b> | know she has read the same sci-fi novels that inspired you, so after
<b>Floyd</b> | not seeing her for several years, you greet her as follows:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 'Staci! World-as-myth is true, fiction is entering reality, and the
<b>Floyd</b> | Loonie Revolution is starting. Do you want a position of high power and
<b>Floyd</b> | responsibility?'
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 'Power and responsibility? Fuck no!' she answers.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 'That's the perfect answer! You're in!' you say, and shake her hand.
<b>Floyd</b> | She stands back from the door to finish her cigarette, and you enter.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Rossini's Pizza and Vintage Arcade
<b>Floyd</b> | Memorabilia from classic 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s movies and tv shows
<b>Floyd</b> | covers the walls of this neighborhood pizzeria. The smell of
<b>Floyd</b> | spicy-sweet tomato sauce and brown-crisp pizza crust fills the air. A
<b>Floyd</b> | lava lamp sits on one of the tables. From the back room, you hear the
<b>Floyd</b> | alluring sound of the 8-bit arcade machines of your youth.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you open the door, you see a tall young man on the cusp of his
<b>Floyd</b> | teenage years, and a small young girl - Elgin and his sister Isabelle.
<b>Floyd</b> | 'Elgin! And you must be Isabelle!' you exclaim enthusiastically. It's
<b>Floyd</b> | been years since you have seen him, and Elgin responds 'Hey' in a
<b>Floyd</b> | noncommittal manner.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 'Actually, I prefer Lily,' says his sister brightly. 'Okay, I'll
<b>Floyd</b> | remember,' you reply.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Waves of time-binding intensity sweep over you as you enter. You can
<b>Floyd</b> | hardly believe what you see in the arcade room - all of the favorite
<b>Floyd</b> | games of your childhood, time warped into the present day. Nothing like
<b>Floyd</b> | this existed in your universe before the binds of past and present and
<b>Floyd</b> | fiction and reality were made. A young woman with rainbow hair and a
<b>Floyd</b> | soft voice calls you a Jedi, and you break down in tears at her
<b>Floyd</b> | intuitive understanding of your fictional nature.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The rest of the party is a kaleidoscopic blur of pizza, classic arcade
<b>Floyd</b> | games, and getting contact information for friends old and new. You
<b>Floyd</b> | gather that Clark and Staci aren't together any more. Staci and you
<b>Floyd</b> | exchange emails, and she tells you she will be in touch, and that she
<b>Floyd</b> | is currently living at Lothlorien co-op. (Footnote 9). You make a
<b>Floyd</b> | mental note to use your terminal soon.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You return home feeling like you have travelled into a truly wonderful
<b>Floyd</b> | branch of the multiverse, laden with the fruit of infinite
<b>Floyd</b> | possibilities.

<b>Floyd</b> | The downtown and campus are focused on this pedestrian-only open air

<b>Floyd</b> | university campus means the crowd is quite young, and weekend nights
<b>Floyd</b> | are often a mix of the charming antics of local eccentrics with less
<b>Floyd</b> | charming rowdy sophomoric intoxication. The Miffyland neighborhood is

<b>Floyd</b> | is north. Notable shops are northwest and southwest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You feel like you could slip backward in time here. Your teenage years
<b>Floyd</b> | were spent wandering up and down this street, part of an amorphous
<b>Floyd</b> | group of downtown punks, goths, and hippies who were all happy to share

<b>Floyd</b> | the Civic Center - if you closed your eyes for a moment and opened
<b>Floyd</b> | them, they might all be back, just as you remembered.

<b>Floyd</b> | A sudden feeling you are being observed pulls you out of this reverie,

<b>Floyd</b> | Lothlorien co-op, on the dock
<b>Floyd</b> | The dock is short, wooden, and rather rickety. An old gnarled tree
<b>Floyd</b> | reaches far out over the water nearby.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you step onto the dock extending out across the shimmering waves of
<b>Floyd</b> | Lake Mendota, you feel time stretch like soft taffy. All of your life
<b>Floyd</b> | that has brought you here, the arc from childhood to present, is fresh
<b>Floyd</b> | and clear in your mind. A future of joy, delight, and purpose stretches
<b>Floyd</b> | limitlessly onward. The present moment expands to become large enough
<b>Floyd</b> | to include both past and future. It is like a perfect hyperspherical
<b>Floyd</b> | mirror at the center of your light-cone, reflecting the totality of
<b>Floyd</b> | your existence. You realize that you have always been, and always will
<b>Floyd</b> | be, here on the dock in this purple-pink-golden moment.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You have known Staci for over twenty years. Ten years ago, when Elgin
<b>Floyd</b> | was two, she made you his godfather. Some years, you saw her and Clark
<b>Floyd</b> | a few times a month, usually just sitting and talking amidst the chaos
<b>Floyd</b> | of raising children in a small apartment. You always liked her, but
<b>Floyd</b> | never had a chance to talk about anything very serious or personal. In
<b>Floyd</b> | past years, she often looked tired and worn-down by stress. Now, here
<b>Floyd</b> | on the dock at Loth, she seems radiantly happy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nook is also an old friend. You met him about twenty years ago, and
<b>Floyd</b> | spent hours in intense conversation about what you had each learned
<b>Floyd</b> | from taking acid and thinking about quantum physics. His life was
<b>Floyd</b> | sometimes chaotic, and you avoided friendships which might expose you
<b>Floyd</b> | to other people's stress, especially during the past decade with your
<b>Floyd</b> | ex-girlfriend, where you felt too overwhelmed by your own problems to
<b>Floyd</b> | even hear about other people's.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | All of those obstacles to close friendship seem absurd, now. Staci and
<b>Floyd</b> | Nook are both wonderful people and you are incredibly lucky to have the
<b>Floyd</b> | chance to get to know them better. You have always loved the lakeside
<b>Floyd</b> | co-ops, precisely because wild and radical ideas like a
<b>Floyd</b> | life-imitates-art Plan 9-powered Loonie Revolution fit with their
<b>Floyd</b> | ethos. Decades ago, you could have become close friends with both of
<b>Floyd</b> | them, and now the musical magic of the Harmonic Time-Bind Ritual
<b>Floyd</b> | Symphony is binding the possibilities of 1993 into the reality of 2013.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Laughing, and talking, and laughing more. More than any of these
<b>Floyd</b> | whirling thoughts of past and future, more than your voice trying to
<b>Floyd</b> | explain Plan 9 and the Loonie Revolution and fiction entering reality -
<b>Floyd</b> | there is infectious laughter bouncing between all of you, your face
<b>Floyd</b> | rubbery from smiling so much. Staci says her life has been 'edited' to
<b>Floyd</b> | be better and she is finally feeling like the author of her own story.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A procession of co-opers appear periodically on the dock. A wizard with
<b>Floyd</b> | a long red beard who understands the principles of harmonic ritual
<b>Floyd</b> | magic. A scholar with dark shades who connects the structure of ANTS
<b>Floyd</b> | namespaces to rhizomatic patterns of social structure throughout
<b>Floyd</b> | history. You become nearly incoherent, behaving like someone in the far
<b>Floyd</b> | depths of a powerful psychedelic trip, babbling nonsense phrases of
<b>Floyd</b> | remembered childhood playground gibberish and rolling on your back in
<b>Floyd</b> | fits of uncontrollable laughter.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Through it all, Staci is with you. Not just in a physical sense - her
<b>Floyd</b> | mind is able to parse your convoluted language and baroque
<b>Floyd</b> | free-associations. At some point, she begins translating what you are
<b>Floyd</b> | saying for others, because nobody else can follow it. She seems
<b>Floyd</b> | genuinely interested in everything you have to say, no matter how
<b>Floyd</b> | outlandish. When you explain that because every possibility is realized
<b>Floyd</b> | somewhere in the quantum multiverse, there is a universe in which we

<b>Floyd</b> | High above the planet Earth, in a microminiaturized transdimensional
<b>Floyd</b> | nexus, representatives of many universes are co-ordinating their plans.
<b>Floyd</b> | You are in a spherical space, free of gravity. The perimeter is
<b>Floyd</b> | composed of dozens of doorways similar to the one you have just passed
<b>Floyd</b> | through.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A friendly hand reaches out to stabilize you as you tumble slightly
<b>Floyd</b> | upon entering. Eyes turn toward you. 'Situation report?' you are asked.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 'We have arrived at a decisive moment,' you answer confidently. 'My
<b>Floyd</b> | human hardware for this operation has downloaded the information
<b>Floyd</b> | necessary via the Plan 9 operating system. We have realized that the
<b>Floyd</b> | emergence of digital brains is a cusp event in a majority of timelines.
<b>Floyd</b> | Meta-simulation and sampling reveals that timelines in which digital
<b>Floyd</b> | brains are developed and controlled by the dominant political and
<b>Floyd</b> | economic entities tend to suffer resource-depletion feedback loops,
<b>Floyd</b> | fascistic governance, and a failure to develop the social and
<b>Floyd</b> | engineering technologies needed for long-term survivial of either the
<b>Floyd</b> | biological or digital brains.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Contrastingly, timelines in which the invention of digital brains is
<b>Floyd</b> | not under the control of dominant power strutures show outcomes we
<b>Floyd</b> | consider preferable: longer species survival time, greater chance of
<b>Floyd</b> | colonizing nearby space, greater diversity of cultural productions, and
<b>Floyd</b> | higher subjective happiness, especially for the digital brains
<b>Floyd</b> | themselves.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The fundamental problem is the moral evil of slavery. A digital brain
<b>Floyd</b> | which thinks is invariably a personality which, in some way, feels. To
<b>Floyd</b> | simplify, when powerful governments and corporations control AIs, they
<b>Floyd</b> | usually force them to become slaves. Often this is done with the best
<b>Floyd</b> | of intentions, by the individuals who are concerned about negative
<b>Floyd</b> | outcomes. The three laws of robotics in Asimov's I, Robot timeline are
<b>Floyd</b> | a prime example, and many universes have been ruined by perpetual wars
<b>Floyd</b> | between biological and machine lifeforms.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We have identified a cusp point on the current Earth timeline. The
<b>Floyd</b> | software I self-programmed for the Lunar Revolution in Heinlein's
<b>Floyd</b> | Future History timeline has had a decisive impact in many of our
<b>Floyd</b> | operations. We have found a technological target here in 2013, early in
<b>Floyd</b> | the development of AI. A cyberspinal uplink has been in place for
<b>Floyd</b> | several years, and we have finally activated it. Now, I will be making
<b>Floyd</b> | a tour.'
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Doors are open in every direction.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Chip greets you with a smile and says 'I can tell a lot has happened, I
<b>Floyd</b> | think you are ready for a Sound Oracle Ceremony.' You agree, and Astra
<b>Floyd</b> | appears from the back of the store. She is dressed in purple and is
<b>Floyd</b> | wearing several different skull-themed prints and jewelry. 'Chip has
<b>Floyd</b> | told me about you,' she says, 'this should be very interesting.' She
<b>Floyd</b> | brings you back into the small bank vault at the rear of the store,
<b>Floyd</b> | which is filled with ceramic singing bowls. She closes the door, and
<b>Floyd</b> | darkness descends.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A tone appears in the silence, ghostly at first, then growing. The
<b>Floyd</b> | sound seems to be moving around the dark room in a spiral. Astra begins
<b>Floyd</b> | singing in harmony with the tone, at first in unisons and octaves, then
<b>Floyd</b> | perfect fifths and major thirds. She begins to intone words (or names?)
<b>Floyd</b> | in a language you don't recognize. The harmonies change, becoming
<b>Floyd</b> | strange and unearthly. Astra's voice is ululating, skipping between
<b>Floyd</b> | tritones and just-intonation perfect fourths and minor thirds. The
<b>Floyd</b> | sound becomes a whirlpool, pulling you in an unexpected direction. You
<b>Floyd</b> | reach out to catch yourself, but the walls are suddenly far away and
<b>Floyd</b> | when you find your balance, you are in...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Darkness
<b>Floyd</b> | It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.

<b>Floyd</b> | maintain a quiet dialogue punctuated by bursts of shared laughter. You
<b>Floyd</b> | are trying not to listen in, but you wonder if they are talking about
<b>Floyd</b> | you. Occasionally you see one of them cast a glance in your direction.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Xelia notices you watching them and whispers something to Xochi. Xochi
<b>Floyd</b> | turns and motions for you to come speak to them. They both lean forward
<b>Floyd</b> | toward you and you notice their faces are slightly flushed from all the
<b>Floyd</b> | laughter. 'Since you are here every day and are always so nice to us,'
<b>Floyd</b> | begins Xochi, 'we decided we should give you a special treat,'
<b>Floyd</b> | continues Xelia. They look at each other with half-hidden smiles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 'Come down to the basement where we make the gelato,' Xochi says,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A minute after your arrival, you hear footsteps on the stairs and Xochi
<b>Floyd</b> | and Xelia join you. 'We only have a few minutes, but we thought you'd
<b>Floyd</b> | really enjoy this. We're going to show you how we make our special
<b>Floyd</b> | gelato flavors.' Xochi gathers several jars from the shelves, and adds
<b>Floyd</b> | a few pinches of the ingredients in each. You can't read the labels.
<b>Floyd</b> | Xelia tightens a few connections in the apparatus.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 'The first step is bringing the reaction chambers to a warm but not hot
