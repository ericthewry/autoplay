					</p>


					<p class="leftalign">
					<span class="fontish smaller">The idea behind ClubFloyd
						is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of 
						people meet online to cooperatively play a game of 
						interactive fiction.<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of ClubFloyd's first play-through of 
						
						
						<em>Whom The Telling Changed</em> written by Aaron A. Reed.
						It was released in 2005. [Note: ClubFloyd's first play-through happened the week before, and that transcript can be found <A HREF="http://allthingsjacq.com/intfic_clubfloyd_20140303.html"><U>here</U></A>.] 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting

					<br>
					
						
					
					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing this game, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played this game, and think you might like to at some
						point, I do not recommend reading any further. Instead,

<b>Floyd</b> | Your mouth is already open to respond when Saiph's voice booms across
<b>Floyd</b> | the circle.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The telling continues. "GILGAMESH looked at Enkidu with disapproving
<b>Floyd</b> | eyes," continues the teller, who then seems to grow tall and strong.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Is this the brave Enkidu I know?" she asks in the voice of the king.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Is this Enkidu who fought with the wild beasts and once challenged
<b>Floyd</b> | King Gilgamesh himself? Have you traded COURAGE for COWARDICE? Our
<b>Floyd</b> | days are few, and chances for glory far between. Do you not wish to
<b>Floyd</b> | burn forever in the minds of men?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The teller becomes Enkidu again, and seems to consider the words of
<b>Floyd</b> | Gilgamesh. "'You have set your mind, I see. You will make this QUEST
<b>Floyd</b> | no matter what your friend ENKIDU counsels. Since that is your road, I
<b>Floyd</b> | will go with you. I will guide you on the hidden paths; I will find
<b>Floyd</b> | for you the hidden water; I will help you on your quest for GLORY.
<b>Floyd</b> | Enkidu will go with you.'"
