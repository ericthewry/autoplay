						The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each
						week at a pre-arranged time, a group of
						people meet online to cooperatively play
						a game of interactive fiction.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>A Beauty Cold and Austere</em> written by Mike Spivey.
						<em>Beauty</em> received 7th place in the 2017 IFComp. This is release 2, published December 18, 2017.

<b>Floyd</b> | The library is a great place to study - or so you've been told.  You

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (You've also been told it's a good place to sleep.  Well, you can

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the study table in front of you are your math book and an empty

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The librarian spots you and begins walking in your direction.  Oh, no.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You might have time to look up one more topic in your math book.
<b>Floyd</b> | Newton, maybe.  He'll probably show up on the final tomorrow.  Or

</b><b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle input">&gt;</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle input">&gt; LOOK UP MATH</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (in your math book)
<b>Floyd</b> | There is considerable debate as to the exact definition of
<b>Floyd</b> | mathematics.  Is it the study of numbers?  Shapes?  Is it discovered,
<b>Floyd</b> | or is it invented?  Aristotle called mathematics "the science of
<b>Floyd</b> | quantity," but some modern areas of mathematics like topology don't
<b>Floyd</b> | really fit that definition.   Bertrand Russell said that mathematics
<b>Floyd</b> | can be reduced to logic, but his own efforts in that area were
<b>Floyd</b> | punctured by Gödel's incompleteness theorems.  Most modern
<b>Floyd</b> | mathematicians take a "I know it when I see it" view, when they bother
<b>Floyd</b> | to think about the definition of mathematics at all.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Regardless of its definition, since the 1600s mathematics has proven
<b>Floyd</b> | to be particularly useful to science.  For example, Isaac Newton's
<b>Floyd</b> | second law of motion, <span class="floydstyle em">F = ma</span>, or force equals mass times
<b>Floyd</b> | acceleration, single-handedly reduced a wide variety of problems in
<b>Floyd</b> | physics to a simple equation.  Modern physics, engineering, chemistry,
<b>Floyd</b> | economics, computers, and even large parts of biology and the social
<b>Floyd</b> | sciences would not be possible without mathematics.  Galileo even went
<b>Floyd</b> | so far as to claim that mathematics is the language with which God has
<b>Floyd</b> | written the universe.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Is mathematics art or science?  Science owes much to mathematics, and
<b>Floyd</b> | Gauss called mathematics "the queen of the sciences."  But some
<b>Floyd</b> | mathematicians sound more like artists when describing their work.
<b>Floyd</b> | Russell, in the following quote, makes that comparison explicit:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme
<b>Floyd</b> | beauty - a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without
<b>Floyd</b> | appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous
<b>Floyd</b> | trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a
<b>Floyd</b> | stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true
<b>Floyd</b> | spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man,
<b>Floyd</b> | which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in
<b>Floyd</b> | mathematics as surely as poetry."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Wow.  That's a lot to digest.  You're never going to remember all of
<b>Floyd</b> | this for tomorrow.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The librarian is getting closer.  You probably should take the
<b>Floyd</b> | initiative and GREET HER.  Maybe if you're friendly she'll let you
<b>Floyd</b> | stay a little longer.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Professor Glasser's survey course in conceptual mathematics seemed
<b>Floyd</b> | like a good idea at the start of the term - no graded homework, no
<b>Floyd</b> | midterm exams - just an oral final at the end.  As the semester
<b>Floyd</b> | progressed, cutting a few classes didn't really seem to matter.
<b>Floyd</b> | Neither did skipping a reading assignment - or a homework set - here
<b>Floyd</b> | and there.   But "a few, here and there" slowly turned into "several,"
<b>Floyd</b> | which turned into "most."  Eventually you were too embarrassed to show
<b>Floyd</b> | up to class anymore, and for the better part of the second half of the
<b>Floyd</b> | term you did an impressive job of forgetting about the final exam.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Until this morning.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Cramming has never worked for you, but what choice did you have?  You
<b>Floyd</b> | already made your choices, you suppose - repeatedly, throughout the
<b>Floyd</b> | semester.

<b>Floyd</b> | Blaming yourself now isn't going to do any good, though.  You can
<b>Floyd</b> | blame yourself all you want after tomorrow.  Focus on the final.
<b>Floyd</b> | Focus on the final.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | How, though?  It's late.  You need more sleep.  But you're not sure
<b>Floyd</b> | you remember much (anything?) from today's library cram session.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You've got to pass that final because you've got to pass the class.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (in your math book)
<b>Floyd</b> | Pythagoras was an ancient Greek mathematician.  He also founded a
<b>Floyd</b> | quasi-religious order whose key belief was that numbers (by which they
<b>Floyd</b> | meant the positive integers) are the basis of everything in the
<b>Floyd</b> | universe.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Pythagorean Theorem says that the square of the diagonal of a
<b>Floyd</b> | right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the sides, or, in
<b>Floyd</b> | symbols, <span class="floydstyle em">a</span>² + <span class="floydstyle em">b</span>² = <span class="floydstyle em">c</span>².  While this
<b>Floyd</b> | theorem
<b>Floyd</b> | is named for Pythagoras, there is no conclusive evidence that he
<b>Floyd</b> | actually proved the theorem.  It probably led to the downfall of his
<b>Floyd</b> | religious cult, though.  If you take a right triangle with sides of
<b>Floyd</b> | length 1, the Pythagorean Theorem says that the length of the diagonal
<b>Floyd</b> | must be the square root of 2.  The proof that the square root of 2 is
<b>Floyd</b> | irrational - by one of the Pythagoreans - invalidated their key belief
<b>Floyd</b> | in numbers.

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | For example, <span class="floydstyle em">Pascal's wager</span> consists of one of the first uses

<b>Floyd</b> | &gt; LOOK UP PASCAL'S TRIANGLE
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (in your math book)
<b>Floyd</b> | Pascal's triangle is a triangle of numbers that have several
<b>Floyd</b> | interpretations.  One meaning is that the number in the <span class="floydstyle em">n</span>th
<b>Floyd</b> | row, <span class="floydstyle em">k</span>th column (denoted <span class="floydstyle em">C(n,k)</span>) is the number of
<b>Floyd</b> | committees of size <span class="floydstyle em">k</span> that can be formed from <span class="floydstyle em">n</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | people.  An equivalent interpretation is that <span class="floydstyle em">C(n,k)</span> is the
<b>Floyd</b> | number of sequences of 1's and 0's that have length <span class="floydstyle em">n</span> and
<b>Floyd</b> | contain exactly <span class="floydstyle em">k</span> 1's.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Another, different kind of meaning of the numbers in Pascal's triangle
<b>Floyd</b> | is that they are the coefficients when expanding
<b>Floyd</b> | (<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>+1)<span class="floydstyle em">ⁿ</span> in powers of <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>.  For example,
<b>Floyd</b> | (<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>+1)⁵ = <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>⁵ + 5<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>⁴ + 10<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>³ +
<b>Floyd</b> | 10<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>²+ 5<span class="floydstyle em">x</span> + 1, and the coefficients 1, 5, 10, 10, 5,
<b>Floyd</b> | 1 are the numbers in row 5 in Pascal's triangle.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Pascal's triangle can be generated very easily: The numbers in the
<b>Floyd</b> | leftmost column are all 1's, and the numbers in the right diagonal are
<b>Floyd</b> | all 1's as well.  Otherwise, to get <span class="floydstyle em">C(n,k)</span>, you add
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">C(n-1,k)</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">C(n-1,k-1)</span>.  In other words, to obtain
<b>Floyd</b> | the number you want, you add the number to its "north" and to its
<b>Floyd</b> | "northwest" in the triangle.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Pascal's triangle is indexed starting with 0 rather than 1: The
<b>Floyd</b> | initial row is row 0, not row 1, and the leftmost column is column 0,
<b>Floyd</b> | not column 1.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | triangle appears to be torn out of your math book.  You did buy it

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Proof that the Square Root of 2 is Irrational</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Suppose the square root of 2 is rational.  Then it can be expressed as
<b>Floyd</b> | a fraction <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>/<span class="floydstyle em">y</span> in lowest terms, so that <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | and <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> are integers with no common factors.  Since
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>/<span class="floydstyle em">y</span> is the square root of 2, squaring
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>/<span class="floydstyle em">y</span> must yield 2, and so we get 2 = <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>² /
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">y</span>².  This means that 2<span class="floydstyle em">y</span>² = <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>².
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Since <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> is an integer, so is <span class="floydstyle em">y</span>².  Since <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>²
<b>Floyd</b> | is 2 times an integer, <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>² must be an even number.  The only
<b>Floyd</b> | way that the square of a number can be even, though, is for the number
<b>Floyd</b> | itself to be even.  Thus <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> is even.  So <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> =
<b>Floyd</b> | 2<span class="floydstyle em">z</span>, where <span class="floydstyle em">z</span> is some other integer.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Substituting 2<span class="floydstyle em">z</span> for <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>, our equation now looks like
<b>Floyd</b> | 2<span class="floydstyle em">y</span>² = (2<span class="floydstyle em">z</span>)² = 4<span class="floydstyle em">z</span>².  Divide both sides by
<b>Floyd</b> | 2
<b>Floyd</b> | to get <span class="floydstyle em">y</span>² = 2<span class="floydstyle em">z</span>².  By the same logic as before, this
<b>Floyd</b> | means <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> is even.  So <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> are both even.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> can't both be even because they have no
<b>Floyd</b> | common factors.  We now have a logical contradiction.  Since our
<b>Floyd</b> | supposition that the square root of 2 is rational leads to a logical
<b>Floyd</b> | contradiction, the only possibility left is that the square root of 2
<b>Floyd</b> | is, in fact, irrational.

<b>Floyd</b> | Then the acolyte picks up the proof.  On her way to the trash urn, she

<b>Floyd</b> | this is blasphemy!  All things must be odd or even or a ratio!  You
<b>Floyd</b> | are in error!  I will show it to you!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She reads over the proof again.  "The error is here, in the second
<b>Floyd</b> | line.  No... the mistake is in the assumption that...  In this place,
<b>Floyd</b> | you can't claim that this follows from...  Aarrrgghh!  This proof is
<b>Floyd</b> | wrong!  I know it is!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She reads the proof a third time.  And then a fourth time.  The anger
<b>Floyd</b> | slowly fades from her face.  "How did you come by such sacred
<b>Floyd</b> | knowledge, and why, why did you share it with me?"  Tears drop onto

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She reads over the proof again.  "The error is here, in the second

<b>Floyd</b> | She reads the proof a third time.  And then a fourth time.  The anger

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Achilles looks at the exhaustion sandals rather skeptically ("I always

<b>Floyd</b> | up, he snaps his fingers, and the tortoise appears.  They find their
<b>Floyd</b> | places as before, and take off.  Achilles runs to the halfway mark,
<b>Floyd</b> | looks up, and sees the tortoise ahead of him.  He notes the tortoise's
<b>Floyd</b> | new position, races to it, and sees the tortoise still ahead.
<b>Floyd</b> | Achilles doesn't give up, though, and every time he looks up he finds
<b>Floyd</b> | himself closer to the tortoise.  As they approach the finish, Achilles
<b>Floyd</b> | is so close to the tortoise you can't see much distance between them.
<b>Floyd</b> | However, the tortoise crosses the finish line just barely ahead of
<b>Floyd</b> | Achilles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The tortoise disappears again, and Achilles jogs back to you.  He
<b>Floyd</b> | returns the exhaustion sandals.  "Thanks for letting me try the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (in your math book)
<b>Floyd</b> | Blaise Pascal was a French mathematician, scientist, philosopher, and
<b>Floyd</b> | theologian.  He is known for constructing one of the first mechanical
<b>Floyd</b> | calculators, for his work in projective geometry, and for his work in
<b>Floyd</b> | hydrodynamics.  A unit of pressure is named after him, as is the
<b>Floyd</b> | triangle of numbers known as "Pascal's triangle."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Pascal was also one of the founders of the field of probability.
<b>Floyd</b> | While his initial work in probability was to solve gambling problems,
<b>Floyd</b> | he applied his insights to other areas of human knowledge as well.
<b>Floyd</b> | For example, <span class="floydstyle em">Pascal's wager</span> consists of one of the first uses
<b>Floyd</b> | of expected values.  In it, Pascal argues that, in the absence of
<b>Floyd</b> | conclusive evidence as to the existence of God, the payoffs for
<b>Floyd</b> | believing in God (infinite happiness if God exists, nothing if God
<b>Floyd</b> | does not) versus not believing in God (eternal damnation if God
<b>Floyd</b> | exists, nothing if God does not) are such that it is more reasonable
<b>Floyd</b> | for humans to bet on belief in God.

<b>Floyd</b> | Girolamo Cardano was a practicing physician, mathematician, and

<b>Floyd</b> | gear, used to convert rotational motion to linear motion, and the
<b>Floyd</b> | Cardan grille, an early cryptographic technique in which secret

<b>Floyd</b> | over a paper containing an ordinary-looking message.  Cardano also
<b>Floyd</b> | contributed to the development of (and sometimes is credited with the
<b>Floyd</b> | invention of) the combination lock.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Mathematically, he was the first person to make systematic use of
<b>Floyd</b> | negative numbers.  His work features the first use of complex numbers,
<b>Floyd</b> | too, as well as the first published solutions to the general cubic and
<b>Floyd</b> | quartic equations.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The story of Achilles and the tortoise is a paradox related to the
<b>Floyd</b> | nature of infinity.  It was devised by Zeno of Elea.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the paradox, Achilles is racing a tortoise who is given a head
<b>Floyd</b> | start.  Zeno claims that Achilles can never catch up to the tortoise
<b>Floyd</b> | because "In a race, the quickest runner can never overtake the
<b>Floyd</b> | slowest, since the pursuer must first reach the point whence the
<b>Floyd</b> | pursued started, so that the slower must always hold a lead."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The paradox of Achilles and the tortoise, as well as Zeno's paradoxes
<b>Floyd</b> | in general, are important in mathematics because they helped force
<b>Floyd</b> | mathematicians to consider carefully what they mean by continuous
<b>Floyd</b> | quantities that are infinitely divisible, as well as infinity itself.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Some mathematicians believe that the limit concept, which not only
<b>Floyd</b> | provides a rigorous method for handling infinite quantities but also
<b>Floyd</b> | put calculus on a firm theoretical foundation, resolves the paradox of
<b>Floyd</b> | Achilles and the tortoise.  However, limits were not developed until
<b>Floyd</b> | over 2000 years after the death of Zeno.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (in your math book)
<b>Floyd</b> | The only mention of slide rules in the index refers to a unit on
<b>Floyd</b> | logarithms, so you turn to that section.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A logarithm is a function whose output is an exponent or power.  For
<b>Floyd</b> | example, the base 10 logarithm of 1000 is 3, since 10^3 is 1000.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The earliest practical use of logarithms was to convert a
<b>Floyd</b> | multiplication calculation to an addition calculation via the
<b>Floyd</b> | logarithm property log(<span class="floydstyle em">xy</span>) = log <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> + log <span class="floydstyle em">y</span>.
<b>Floyd</b> | The slide rule operates on this and other properties of logarithms.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (There follows a detailed description of how to work a slide rule to
<b>Floyd</b> | do multiplication using logarithms.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Using the example, you practice with the slide rule until you
<b>Floyd</b> | understand how to use it to do multiplication.

<b>Floyd</b> | You show the slide rule to the Countess, and you carefully explain to
<b>Floyd</b> | her how to use it to do multiplication.  She immediately grasps the

<b>Floyd</b> | Do you mind if I have it?"  You give your assent, and the Countess
<b>Floyd</b> | smiles widely.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "If this does multiplication, it could also do division."  She begins
<b>Floyd</b> | playing with the slide rule.  "And it should be able to calculate
<b>Floyd</b> | powers of a number."  She performs a few more calculations on the
<b>Floyd</b> | slide rule.  "Yes!" she says.  "Here, let me show you what I've done."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As the Countess explains how to use the slide rule to do division and
<b>Floyd</b> | exponentiation, you realize that she is essentially showing you two
<b>Floyd</b> | more logarithm properties: log(<span class="floydstyle em">x/y</span>) = log <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> - log
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">y</span>, converting division to subtraction, and log <span class="floydstyle em">x^n</span> =
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">n</span> log <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>, converting exponentiation to
<b>Floyd</b> | multiplication.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Thank you so much for the slide rule.  What an ingenious device and
<b>Floyd</b> | valuable gift!" she says.  "I must reciprocate!"  She produces a small

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (in your math book)
<b>Floyd</b> | Pierre de Fermat was a contemporary and sometime rival of Descartes.
<b>Floyd</b> | He was the greatest number theorist of his era, invented analytic
<b>Floyd</b> | geometry about the same time as Descartes (but did not publish his
<b>Floyd</b> | results), and his method of tangents was a forerunner to the
<b>Floyd</b> | derivative concept used in calculus.  Fermat was actually a lawyer and
<b>Floyd</b> | did mathematics for fun in his spare time.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Fermat is most well-known for his conjecture that become known as
<b>Floyd</b> | "Fermat's Last Theorem":  There do not exist solutions in nonzero
<b>Floyd</b> | integers <span class="floydstyle em">a</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">b</span>, <span class="floydstyle em">c</span>, and <span class="floydstyle em">n</span> &gt; 2, such
<b>Floyd</b> | that <span class="floydstyle em">a^n</span>  + <span class="floydstyle em">b^n</span> = <span class="floydstyle em">c^n</span>.  In his copy of
<b>Floyd</b> | Diophantus's <span class="floydstyle em">Arithmetica</span> Fermat claimed to have found a
<b>Floyd</b> | "truly remarkable proof of this theorem which this margin is too
<b>Floyd</b> | narrow to contain."  No one has ever found Fermat's proof, and,
<b>Floyd</b> | despite an enormous amount of effort, nobody succeeded in proving it
<b>Floyd</b> | themselves until 1995, more than 350 years later.

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle input">&gt; LOOK UP OPTIMAL STOPPING</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (in your math book)
<b>Floyd</b> | An optimal stopping problem is one in which you are faced with the
<b>Floyd</b> | problem of when to take a particular action in order to maximize a
<b>Floyd</b> | reward or minimize a cost.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The most famous optimal stopping problem is the <span class="floydstyle em">secretary</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">problem</span>: You want to hire a secretary.  You have <span class="floydstyle em">n</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | candidates, and you interview them one-by-one.  After each interview,
<b>Floyd</b> | you must decide whether to hire or reject the person you just
<b>Floyd</b> | interviewed.  You cannot go back and hire a candidate you have already
<b>Floyd</b> | rejected.  If you want to maximize your chances of hiring the best
<b>Floyd</b> | person for the job the optimal strategy turns out to be to
<b>Floyd</b> | automatically reject the first <span class="floydstyle em">X</span> candidates and then hire the
<b>Floyd</b> | next candidate after that who is better than all of the candidates you
<b>Floyd</b> | have seen thus far.  Surprisingly, if <span class="floydstyle em">X</span> corresponds to the
<b>Floyd</b> | first <span class="floydstyle em">n</span>/<span class="floydstyle em">e</span> (in other words, the first 37% of)
<b>Floyd</b> | candidates, then the probability of selecting the single best
<b>Floyd</b> | candidate out of the entire <span class="floydstyle em">n</span> candidates is about 37%.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you want one of the two best candidates instead, then you can get
<b>Floyd</b> | above a 50% chance using a similar strategy.  In fact, there's a wide
<b>Floyd</b> | range of values of <span class="floydstyle em">X</span> that work well in the top two case.  For
<b>Floyd</b> | example, if <span class="floydstyle em">n</span> is 100, then any choice of <span class="floydstyle em">X</span> between
<b>Floyd</b> | 22 and 39 will give you a better than 50% chance of selecting one of
<b>Floyd</b> | the two best candidates.

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle input">&gt; X NOTES</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | These are Berkeley's notes describing what he considers to be serious
<b>Floyd</b> | logical flaws in the theoretical foundation of calculus.  The notes
<b>Floyd</b> | are rather extensive, but the details of his attack on the fluxion of
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>^2 catch your eye.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Newton says that the fluxion, or derivative, of <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>^2 is to be
<b>Floyd</b> | calculated like so: Adding the infinitely small quantity o to
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> causes <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>^2 to become (<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>+o)^2.  Then
<b>Floyd</b> | (<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>+o)^2 expands to <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>^2 + 2o<span class="floydstyle em">x</span> + o^2.
<b>Floyd</b> | Subtracting <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>^2 from the expansion of (<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>+o)^2 gives
<b>Floyd</b> | us 2o<span class="floydstyle em">x</span> + o^2.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The next step in the procedure is to divide by the infinitely small
<b>Floyd</b> | quantity o, producing 2<span class="floydstyle em">x</span> + o.  Newton says now that since o
<b>Floyd</b> | is infinitely small we can ignore it.  This means that the fluxion of
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>^2 is 2<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "However, is the 'infinitely small quantity' denoted 'o' equal to zero
<b>Floyd</b> | or not?  If it is zero, then we cannot divide by it, since there is no
<b>Floyd</b> | meaning to dividing by zero.  If it is not zero, then we cannot ignore
<b>Floyd</b> | it in the last step, and so the fluxion of <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>^2 cannot be
<b>Floyd</b> | 2<span class="floydstyle em">x</span>.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You cannot have it both ways: Either o is equal to zero or it is

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (in your math book)
<b>Floyd</b> | Along with John Locke and David Hume, Bishop George Berkeley is
<b>Floyd</b> | considered part of the trio of great British empirical philosophers of
<b>Floyd</b> | the 17th and 18th centuries.  His major contribution to mathematics
<b>Floyd</b> | was his critique of the logical foundations of calculus.  This
<b>Floyd</b> | critique helped inspire mathematicians to look more closely at what
<b>Floyd</b> | they meant by the "infinitesimally small" quantities used in calculus,
<b>Floyd</b> | ultimately leading to a precise definition of the limit concept.
<b>Floyd</b> | Incidentally, the main campus of the University of California and the
<b>Floyd</b> | surrounding city are named for him.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (in your math book)
<b>Floyd</b> | The limit is one of the most important concepts in mathematics.
<b>Floyd</b> | Limits allow us to define exactly what we mean by concepts like
<b>Floyd</b> | "arbitrarily large" and "infinitesimally small."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Limits had been used implicitly in calculus since the time of Newton
<b>Floyd</b> | and Leibniz, but it was not until over 150 years later that the
<b>Floyd</b> | definition of a limit was made precise by Weierstrass, thereby placing
<b>Floyd</b> | calculus on a more solid theoretical foundation.  Limits are also used
<b>Floyd</b> | to make sense of sequences and infinite series.  Some argue that
<b>Floyd</b> | limits resolve Zeno's paradoxes.

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle input">&gt; LOOK UP DERIVATIVE</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (in your math book)
<b>Floyd</b> | The derivative is one of the major concepts in calculus.  Roughly
<b>Floyd</b> | speaking, it gives a precise way to determine the ratio of two
<b>Floyd</b> | quantities as they become infinitely small.  Thus it can be used to
<b>Floyd</b> | measure rates of change, with applications like velocity,
<b>Floyd</b> | acceleration, and marginal cost.  It can also be used to find the
<b>Floyd</b> | slope, or steepness, of the graph of a function, as this can be
<b>Floyd</b> | thought of as the ratio of the vertical change in the graph of a
<b>Floyd</b> | function to a corresponding horizontal change.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Another major application of the derivative is to find the maximum or
<b>Floyd</b> | minimum value of a function.  The maximum of a function occurs when
<b>Floyd</b> | the graph of the function switches from ascending to descending.
<b>Floyd</b> | Since the derivative is positive when the graph of a function is
<b>Floyd</b> | ascending, and the derivative is negative when the graph of a function
<b>Floyd</b> | is descending, at the maximum the derivative has a value of zero.  A
<b>Floyd</b> | similar scenario holds true for the minimum of a function.  In that
<b>Floyd</b> | case the graph of the function switches from descending to ascending,
<b>Floyd</b> | and so its derivative switches from negative to positive.  The value
<b>Floyd</b> | of the derivative at the minimum is also zero.  There are some other
<b>Floyd</b> | technicalities to consider, but this is the basic situation.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (the poker game)
<b>Floyd</b> | You place the old coin on the poker table.  Diaconis gives you a pile
<b>Floyd</b> | of money in exchange for the coin, and then he deals the cards.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You play several hands.  At first you lose more than you win, but
<b>Floyd</b> | thanks to your knowledge of probability, you find that you are pretty
<b>Floyd</b> | good at calculating exactly how strong your hand is and what would be
<b>Floyd</b> | a reasonable amount to bet for each hand.  As the game continues, your
<b>Floyd</b> | skill increases, and your calculations become more and more accurate.
<b>Floyd</b> | Even though you don't know what cards the other players hold, your
<b>Floyd</b> | ability to determine precisely both your hand strength and the optimal
<b>Floyd</b> | betting amount mean that, over time, you win much more than you lose.
<b>Floyd</b> | The other players start to drop out - first Kolmogorov, then Bayes,
<b>Floyd</b> | and then Diaconis.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You and Pascal continue to play, each winning several hands.  Finally
<b>Floyd</b> | Pascal gets a hand he's very confident of.  "All in," he says, as he
<b>Floyd</b> | pushes the rest of his money to the center of the table.  Glancing at
<b>Floyd</b> | your cards, you decide to call his bet.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Pascal, grinning from ear to ear, lays down an ace-high straight.  You
<b>Floyd</b> | slowly put one, then a second, a third, a fourth, and finally a fifth
<b>Floyd</b> | spade on the table.  Pascal's smile slides awkwardly off his face.
<b>Floyd</b> | You gather your winnings into a pile.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Shaking his head, Pascal congratulates you, as do Kolmogorov, Bayes,
<b>Floyd</b> | and Diaconis.  The four of them get up from the table and walk off.
<b>Floyd</b> | As they leave, you hear Pascal berating himself to Bayes over his last
<b>Floyd</b> | bet: "I should have known better.  The only thing worth wagering all
<b>Floyd</b> | you have is infinite happiness."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (in your math book)
<b>Floyd</b> | The derivative is one of the major concepts in calculus.  Roughly
<b>Floyd</b> | speaking, it gives a precise way to determine the ratio of two
<b>Floyd</b> | quantities as they become infinitely small.  Thus it can be used to
<b>Floyd</b> | measure rates of change, with applications like velocity,
<b>Floyd</b> | acceleration, and marginal cost.  It can also be used to find the
<b>Floyd</b> | slope, or steepness, of the graph of a function, as this can be
<b>Floyd</b> | thought of as the ratio of the vertical change in the graph of a
<b>Floyd</b> | function to a corresponding horizontal change.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Another major application of the derivative is to find the maximum or
<b>Floyd</b> | minimum value of a function.  The maximum of a function occurs when
<b>Floyd</b> | the graph of the function switches from ascending to descending.
<b>Floyd</b> | Since the derivative is positive when the graph of a function is
<b>Floyd</b> | ascending, and the derivative is negative when the graph of a function
<b>Floyd</b> | is descending, at the maximum the derivative has a value of zero.  A
<b>Floyd</b> | similar scenario holds true for the minimum of a function.  In that
<b>Floyd</b> | case the graph of the function switches from descending to ascending,
<b>Floyd</b> | and so its derivative switches from negative to positive.  The value
<b>Floyd</b> | of the derivative at the minimum is also zero.  There are some other
<b>Floyd</b> | technicalities to consider, but this is the basic situation.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The control panel is labeled "Transformation Matrix Prototype."  It

<b>Floyd</b> | The first page begins a discussion of three-dimensional transformation
<b>Floyd</b> | matrices.  It points out that the columns in a transformation matrix
<b>Floyd</b> | consist of the "inputs," while the rows consist of the "outputs."  For
<b>Floyd</b> | instance, the entry in column 1, row 2 indicates the effect of the
<b>Floyd</b> | first, or <span class="floydstyle em">x</span>, dimension of the original object on producing
<b>Floyd</b> | the second, or <span class="floydstyle em">y</span>, dimension of the transformed object.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Starting with the second page, there are some examples of
<b>Floyd</b> | three-dimensional transformation matrices.  The first involves the
<b>Floyd</b> | matrix
<b>Floyd</b> |  1  0  0
<b>Floyd</b> |  0  1  0
<b>Floyd</b> |  0  0  1.
<b>Floyd</b> | The fact that the first row of this transformation matrix consists of
<b>Floyd</b> | 1, 0, 0, means that, to produce the <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> coordinates of the
<b>Floyd</b> | output object the matrix takes only the <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> coordinates of the
<b>Floyd</b> | input object and multiplies each of them by 1.  The 0, 1, 0 in the
<b>Floyd</b> | second row means that, to produce the <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> coordinates of the
<b>Floyd</b> | output object the matrix takes only the <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> coordinates of the
<b>Floyd</b> | input object and multiplies each of them by 1.  The same is true for
<b>Floyd</b> | the 0, 0, 1 in the third row and the <span class="floydstyle em">z</span> coordinates.  This
<b>Floyd</b> | transformation matrix doesn't really do anything, then; since none of
<b>Floyd</b> | the coordinates are changed, the output object is the same as the
<b>Floyd</b> | input object.

<b>Floyd</b> | The final page mentions that combinations of these effects as well as
<b>Floyd</b> | other effects can be achieved by using different matrices.  A
<b>Floyd</b> | three-dimensional object can even be turned into a two-dimensional or
<b>Floyd</b> | even a one-dimensional object by using the appropriate transformation
<b>Floyd</b> | matrix.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At the end of the final page is a brief description of one of the
<b>Floyd</b> | graduate student experiments involving transformation matrices.  Thus
<b>Floyd</b> | far the student has constructed a prototype that allows one to apply a
<b>Floyd</b> | transformation matrix to a physical object.  For the prototype the
<b>Floyd</b> | transformations that produce the <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">z</span> coordinates
<b>Floyd</b> | are hard-coded; the user can only affect the transformations for the
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> coordinates of the new object.  In addition, only a few
<b>Floyd</b> | choices have thus far been implemented for the top row of the matrix.
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, the transformation effect is thus far permanent only for
<b>Floyd</b> | objects made of lead.  Even for lead objects, though, the process
<b>Floyd</b> | seems to be permanent only once; subsequent transformations on a
<b>Floyd</b> | transformed lead object have so far only been temporary.  The current
<b>Floyd</b> | hypothesis is that the transformation process changes something about
<b>Floyd</b> | the lead object at the atomic level.

<b>Floyd</b> | Brass wheels, gears, knobs, and pipes emitting smoke are everywhere:
<b>Floyd</b> | This is a room out of some steampunk's dream.  The south end of the

<b>Floyd</b> | as you can see.  You may also exit west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The room is dominated by a large, complicated-looking machine in its

<b>Floyd</b> | This machine is just as steampunk as everything else here, although

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For one, the machine has a switch that can be set to "Sequence" or
<b>Floyd</b> | "Series."  It is currently set to "Sequence," although you could
<b>Floyd</b> | easily move it to the other setting by flipping the switch.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a button labeled "Alternate" that is currently pushed off.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The machine also has a dial that can be set to "Constant," "Identity,"
<b>Floyd</b> | "Squared," or "Reciprocal."  It is currently set to "Constant."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a small circular hole near the button.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, there is a warning light on top of the machine.  The warning
<b>Floyd</b> | light is dark.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You step onto the path and follow it for a while.  It seems to stretch

<b>Floyd</b> | Karl Weierstrass, one of the great mathematicians of the 19th century,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Weierstrass lifts his head from his mug long enough to glance at the
<b>Floyd</b> | proffered notes.  He grunts and starts to return to his mug - but then
<b>Floyd</b> | he stops.  He takes the notes from you and reads through them.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Berkeley's criticisms of the foundations of calculus... Yes..."  He
<b>Floyd</b> | thinks for a while.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then he turns to Cauchy.  "The limit concept you've used in your work
<b>Floyd</b> | - I wonder if that would help here.  But it needs to be more
<b>Floyd</b> | rigorous."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Cauchy and Weierstrass are soon deep in conversation, scribbling
<b>Floyd</b> | mathematical symbols and scratching them out again on a bar napkin.
<b>Floyd</b> | About all of the conversation you can follow are the words "function,"
<b>Floyd</b> | "distance," "error," and "limit," each repeated several times.
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, Weierstrass says, "And if we use delta for 'distance' and
<b>Floyd</b> | epsilon for 'error,' that should do it!"  He pockets the napkin.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Weierstrass looks at you excitedly.  "I think I've got some ideas that

<b>Floyd</b> | closes his eyes and concentrates for a moment.  The sandals begin to
<b>Floyd</b> | glow, and then they start to morph.  Soon Weierstrass is holding a

<b>Floyd</b> | "Thanks again," he says.  He stands up, an eager look on his face.  "I

<b>Floyd</b> | Weierstrass downs the rest of his beer, places his mug on the bar, and

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Achilles looks at the limit shoes rather skeptically, but you assure
<b>Floyd</b> | him that these shoes are different - more powerful than the exhaustion
<b>Floyd</b> | sandals - and so he agrees to try them.  After lacing them up, he
<b>Floyd</b> | snaps his fingers, and the tortoise appears.  They find their places
<b>Floyd</b> | as before, and take off.  Achilles runs to the halfway mark, looks up,
<b>Floyd</b> | and sees the tortoise ahead of him.  He notes the tortoise's new
<b>Floyd</b> | position, races to it, and sees the tortoise still ahead.  You start
<b>Floyd</b> | to think that the limit shoes aren't going to do Achilles any good.
<b>Floyd</b> | About this time, though, their inherent virtue starts to kick in.
<b>Floyd</b> | Yes, there are infinitely many times Achilles must note the tortoise's
<b>Floyd</b> | position, leading to infinitely many distances he must run, but each
<b>Floyd</b> | successive distance is shorter than the one before.  The power of the
<b>Floyd</b> | limit shoes successfully sums the lengths of these infinitely many
<b>Floyd</b> | shorter and shorter distances, and Achilles passes the tortoise for
<b>Floyd</b> | the win!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Achilles jogs back to the start, a huge grin on his face, and gives
<b>Floyd</b> | you a crushing hug.  Slightly abashed, he steps back, thanks you
<b>Floyd</b> | profusely, and returns the limit shoes.  He runs away to celebrate.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you're recovering from Achilles's excitement, Zeno walks over from
<b>Floyd</b> | where he has been discreetly watching the race.  He picks up the
<b>Floyd</b> | tortoise.  As he gazes quizzically at it, he's joined by Aristotle.
<b>Floyd</b> | They head off, arguing over whether the limit process actually solves
<b>Floyd</b> | the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise.  You notice something fall

<b>Floyd</b> | This scroll contains a discussion of logical fallacies.  Two prominent
<b>Floyd</b> | ones mentioned are "Affirming the Consequent" and "Denying the
<b>Floyd</b> | Antecedent."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An example of "Affirming the Consequent" is the following argument.
<b>Floyd</b> | "If one drinks hemlock then they will die.  Thucydides is dead.
<b>Floyd</b> | Therefore, Thucydides must have drunk hemlock."  The first two
<b>Floyd</b> | statements are true, but the third is false.  The argument is invalid
<b>Floyd</b> | because there are other ways that Thucydides could have died than
<b>Floyd</b> | drinking hemlock.  In other words, the truth of the consequent, "they
<b>Floyd</b> | died," does not imply the truth of the antecedent, "they drank
<b>Floyd</b> | hemlock."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An example of "Denying the Antecedent" is the following argument.  "If
<b>Floyd</b> | one writes the <span class="floydstyle em">Iliad</span> then they will be famous.  Plato didn't
<b>Floyd</b> | write the <span class="floydstyle em">Iliad</span>.  Therefore, Plato will not be famous."  The
<b>Floyd</b> | first two statements are true, but the third is false.  The argument
<b>Floyd</b> | is invalid because there are other ways that Plato could be famous
<b>Floyd</b> | besides writing the <span class="floydstyle em">Iliad</span>.  In other words, the falseness of
<b>Floyd</b> | the antecedent, "one writes the <span class="floydstyle em">Iliad</span>," does not imply the
<b>Floyd</b> | falseness of the consequent, "they will not be famous."

<b>Floyd</b> | In his relatively short life, Bernhard Riemann made several important
<b>Floyd</b> | contributions to mathematics.  His doctoral dissertation contained
<b>Floyd</b> | groundbreaking ideas in geometry and complex analysis.  He gave the
<b>Floyd</b> | first rigorous definition of the integral (one of the three major
<b>Floyd</b> | concepts in calculus).  He proved the Riemann Rearrangement Theorem

<b>Floyd</b> | The path is level with the floor of the room you are currently in.  It
<b>Floyd</b> | consists of golden steps that seem to run on forever.  Each step has
<b>Floyd</b> | two numbers appearing on it, although from here you can only read the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Just before you reach the path, though, it shifts: The heights of the

<b>Floyd</b> | evenly, each step just as much of an upstep as the previous one.  In
<b>Floyd</b> | fact, the path looks like a set of stairs.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then you walk out onto the path.  The limit shoes react to the contact

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (in your math book)
<b>Floyd</b> | Srinivasa Ramanujan was one of the most fascinating mathematicians of
<b>Floyd</b> | the early 20th century.  Mostly self-taught, and largely working in
<b>Floyd</b> | isolation from the world's mathematical community, he found creative
<b>Floyd</b> | and profoundly original solutions to outstanding problems in number
<b>Floyd</b> | theory and infinite series.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Seeking a greater connection with that community, he sent his
<b>Floyd</b> | discoveries to several British mathematicians, most of whom dismissed
<b>Floyd</b> | his findings or simply returned his work with no comment.  However, G.
<b>Floyd</b> | H. Hardy recognized Ramanujan's genius and was eventually able to
<b>Floyd</b> | arrange for Ramanujan to come to Cambridge University.  There followed
<b>Floyd</b> | several years of fruitful collaboration with Hardy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Unfortunately, Ramanujan had health problems during his time in
<b>Floyd</b> | England.  He contracted tuberculosis and died at the age of 32, having
<b>Floyd</b> | spent only six years in Britain.  The 2015 biographical film <span class="floydstyle em">The</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Man Who Knew Infinity</span> is about Ramanujan.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Just before you reach the path, though, it shifts: The heights of the

<b>Floyd</b> | very gradually.  In fact, it's such a gradual rise that it's hard to
<b>Floyd</b> | tell whether the path is leveling out or continuing to climb.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then you walk out onto the path.  The limit shoes react to the contact

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ramanujan suggested it," you reply.  "<span class="floydstyle em">Ramanujan?</span>  Really?"

<b>Floyd</b> | The imp disappears and then rematerializes on the other side of the
<b>Floyd</b> | window.  He grabs Descartes by the arm, and they both vanish.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hypatia turns back to you.  "Thank you for straightening that out,"
<b>Floyd</b> | she says.  "My imp will be returning Descartes to wherever he was
<b>Floyd</b> | before.  Hopefully we won't be seeing that kind of mistake again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "If you don't mind, though, I probably should get back to my
<b>Floyd</b> | computer."  She sighs.  "The Internet has brought out all of the
<b>Floyd</b> | cranks from whatever holes they normally hide in.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Speaking of which..."  She hands you a small object.  "People keep
<b>Floyd</b> | giving me these as gag gifts.  You might it useful.  Also, if you mess
<b>Floyd</b> | it up, bring it back, and I'll give you a new one.  Just knock on the
<b>Floyd</b> | door to get my attention."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hypatia presses a button on her phone, and the door in the west wall
<b>Floyd</b> | slides open.  She walks through it.  As the door closes behind her,
<b>Floyd</b> | she calls out, "You might want to check on Descartes; he will probably
<b>Floyd</b> | be grateful for what you've done!"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a small circular hole near the button.  A brass rod has been

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, there is a warning light on top of the machine.  The warning

<b>Floyd</b> | As you approach the golden path you take another look at it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The path is level with the floor of the room you are currently in.  It
<b>Floyd</b> | consists of golden steps that seem to run on forever.  Each step has
<b>Floyd</b> | two numbers appearing on it, although from here you can only read the
<b>Floyd</b> | numbers on the six closest steps.  The first numbers on the steps are
<b>Floyd</b> | 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, and 1/6.  The second numbers are 1, -1/2, 1/3,
<b>Floyd</b> | -1/4, 1/5, and -1/6.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you near the path, though, the second step swaps places with the
<b>Floyd</b> | fifth step.  Then the sixth step swaps places with the first step.
<b>Floyd</b> | Other steps swap places with each other, and you stop, watching, as
<b>Floyd</b> | the entire path appears to rearrange itself.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then a mechanical voice intones, "Rearrangement failed."  The steps
<b>Floyd</b> | continue to swap places with each other for a while.  When they finish
<b>Floyd</b> | you realize from their numbers that they are back in their initial
<b>Floyd</b> | order.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You move towards the path once more.  Just before you reach it,
<b>Floyd</b> | though, it shifts: The heights of the steps change.  The first step is
<b>Floyd</b> | now up.  After that, the second step is down, the third step is up,
<b>Floyd</b> | the fourth is down again, and so on, up, down, up, down... for as far
<b>Floyd</b> | as you can see.  Each down step looks like it goes below the level of
<b>Floyd</b> | the floor of this room, and each up step looks like it is above that
<b>Floyd</b> | level.  However, each down step isn't quite as far down as the one
<b>Floyd</b> | before, and each up step isn't quite as far up as the one before.
<b>Floyd</b> | After a while, despite the up and down steps, the path looks almost
<b>Floyd</b> | flat.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then you walk out onto the path.  The limit shoes react to the contact
<b>Floyd</b> | with the first step: They propel you to the next step, and the next,
<b>Floyd</b> | and the next - faster and faster.  Soon you are moving so fast the
<b>Floyd</b> | path is a blur, and then you can't even see it anymore.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You find yourself hurtling through space, only to land in...

<b>Floyd</b> | The final page mentions that combinations of these effects as well as
<b>Floyd</b> | other effects can be achieved by using different matrices.  A
<b>Floyd</b> | three-dimensional object can even be turned into a two-dimensional or
<b>Floyd</b> | even a one-dimensional object by using the appropriate transformation
<b>Floyd</b> | matrix.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At the end of the final page is a brief description of one of the
<b>Floyd</b> | graduate student experiments involving transformation matrices.  Thus
<b>Floyd</b> | far the student has constructed a prototype that allows one to apply a
<b>Floyd</b> | transformation matrix to a physical object.  For the prototype the
<b>Floyd</b> | transformations that produce the <span class="floydstyle em">y</span> and <span class="floydstyle em">z</span> coordinates
<b>Floyd</b> | are hard-coded; the user can only affect the transformations for the
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">x</span> coordinates of the new object.  In addition, only a few
<b>Floyd</b> | choices have thus far been implemented for the top row of the matrix.
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, the transformation effect is thus far permanent only for
<b>Floyd</b> | objects made of lead.  Even for lead objects, though, the process
<b>Floyd</b> | seems to be permanent only once; subsequent transformations on a
<b>Floyd</b> | transformed lead object have so far only been temporary.  The current
<b>Floyd</b> | hypothesis is that the transformation process changes something about
<b>Floyd</b> | the lead object at the atomic level.

<b>Floyd</b> | Victor J. Katz, was indispensable, as was Wikipedia.  (Wikipedia has a
<b>Floyd</b> | bad reputation for reliability, but I have found its mathematics pages
<b>Floyd</b> | to be quite good.  Information about historical figures obtained from
<b>Floyd</b> | Wikipedia was generally double-checked against other resources.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For further reading on the history of mathematics I recommend <span class="floydstyle em">Men</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">of Mathematics</span>, by Eric Temple Bell.  It's a bit old (1930s), but
<b>Floyd</b> | it's still the most lively and readable book on mathematicians and the
<b>Floyd</b> | history of mathematics that I know.

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Beauty Cold and Austere</span> contains references to or riffs on

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Voyaging</span>, and <span class="floydstyle em">Trinity</span>.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Trinity</span>, by Brian Moriarty, deserves special mention.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | structure of <span class="floydstyle em">Trinity</span> is somewhat repeated in <span class="floydstyle em">ABCA</span>,
<b>Floyd</b> | and the Klein bottle puzzle in <span class="floydstyle em">Trinity</span> was an inspiration for
<b>Floyd</b> | the idea of introducing advanced mathematical concepts through the
<b>Floyd</b> | medium of interactive fiction.  (Playing <span class="floydstyle em">Trinity</span> at age 13
<b>Floyd</b> | was my introduction to a Klein bottle.)  The crank puzzle in
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">ABCA</span> is of course a riff on the Klein bottle puzzle in
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Trinity</span>.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Curses!</span>, by Graham Nelson.  After the demise of Infocom in
<b>Floyd</b> | the late 1980s, I mostly gave up playing interactive fiction for the
<b>Floyd</b> | better part of 30 years.  In February of 2017 I decided to try
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Curses!</span>.  It inspired me both to take a serious look at
<b>Floyd</b> | "modern" interactive fiction and to write a piece of IF on my own.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">GiantKiller</span>, by Peter D. Killworth, and <span class="floydstyle em">The Chinese</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Room</span>, by Harry Giles and Joey Jones.  When I was trying to decide
<b>Floyd</b> | what level to aim for with <span class="floydstyle em">ABCA</span>, these two games convinced me
<b>Floyd</b> | to go high.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle i">Quotations</span>: "Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare" is by Edna
<b>Floyd</b> | St. Vincent Millay.
<b>Floyd</b> | The quote likening mathematics to a blind man in a dark room has been
<b>Floyd</b> | attributed to Darwin, but it's questionable whether he actually said
<b>Floyd</b> | that.
<b>Floyd</b> | The poem about infinite series is by, believe it or not, a
<b>Floyd</b> | mathematician: Jakob Bernoulli.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Tell all the truth but tell it slant" is by Emily Dickinson.
<b>Floyd</b> | The poem in Italian you hear after creating the fractal consists of
<b>Floyd</b> | selections from Dante's <span class="floydstyle em">Paradiso</span>, Canto XXXIII, as Dante is
<b>Floyd</b> | approaching his final vision of God.
