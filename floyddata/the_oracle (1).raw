The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>The Oracle</i>, written by Brandon Allen.  <I>The Oracle</I> was written in TADS 2 and originally released in 2002.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/The_Oracle'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The drums of war have beaten long throughout the land of your
<b>Floyd</b> | forefathers.  At night, the fiendish glow of enemy campfires has shone
<b>Floyd</b> | orange and horrible on the horizon for as many years as you can recall.
<b>Floyd</b> | The warriors of your land have battled long and valiantly against the
<b>Floyd</b> | demon hordes pressing relentlessly forward, assailing your
<b>Floyd</b> | ever-diminishing borders.  The fight has been mighty, but the strength
<b>Floyd</b> | of your people has begun to wane.  Only a few of the warriors remain to
<b>Floyd</b> | lead the rag-tag brigades of youthful peasants into battle.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The council of elders has seen that it is not long before the invaders
<b>Floyd</b> | will breach the skirmish lines and plunder the farms and villages of
<b>Floyd</b> | your homeland.  The council has decreed that after centuries of
<b>Floyd</b> | silence, the voice of the great oracle must be heard once more if this
<b>Floyd</b> | horrible foe is to be repelled.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Barely old enough to follow the warriors into battle, you were filled
<b>Floyd</b> | with great pride when you were selected as the messenger who would be
<b>Floyd</b> | sent to beg the great oracle for her counsel.  The elders summoned you
<b>Floyd</b> | into the great hall, admonishing you to stay on the old path leading
<b>Floyd</b> | into the high mountains.  After precious few other words of
<b>Floyd</b> | instruction, they sent you on your way.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For many days now, you have trod the ancient trail, winding higher and
<b>Floyd</b> | higher into the rugged peaks of the Black Mountains.  Cold, hungry and
<b>Floyd</b> | alone, you somehow sense that you are nearing the oracle's hiding place
<b>Floyd</b> | deep within the great mountain.  At last, the crumbling path fades away
<b>Floyd</b> | at the foot of a vast wall of solid rock

<b>Floyd</b> | Cliff Base
<b>Floyd</b> |    The greatest peak of the Black Mountains rises sharply before you;
<b>Floyd</b> | an impenetrable dagger of dark granite jutting high into the clouds
<b>Floyd</b> | above.  You stand at the base of an immense cliff, where a deep alcove
<b>Floyd</b> | has been chiseled from the living rock.  It almost appears to be the
<b>Floyd</b> | yawning mouth of a great, black cave.  As you stand at its entrance you
<b>Floyd</b> | can see steps cut from the jagged stone, leading southward into the
<b>Floyd</b> | bowels of the mountain.

<b>Floyd</b> |    You are in a great, damp cavern, carved from hard granite by the
<b>Floyd</b> | incessant fingers of rainwater trickling down through the heart of the
<b>Floyd</b> | great mountain.  Along the cavern's western wall, a small stream
<b>Floyd</b> | emerges from a crevice in the solid rock.  The stream splashes downward
<b>Floyd</b> | over the tumble of stones that make up the cavern's floor until it
<b>Floyd</b> | vanishes beneath an iron door.  The door is set in a small hollow where
<b>Floyd</b> | the southernmost extremity of the cavern's roof dips down toward the
<b>Floyd</b> | jagged floor.  Against the western wall is a pile of loose shale that
<b>Floyd</b> | seems incongruent with the larger stones that make up the balance of
<b>Floyd</b> | the cavern's floor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you crawl deeper into the dark cavern, you notice that the amulet
<b>Floyd</b> | hanging about your neck begins to glow with a wan, greenish light.  It
<b>Floyd</b> | seems to grow brighter as the fading light from above dwindles to
<b>Floyd</b> | darkness.  The amulet provides you with just enough illumination to see

<b>Floyd</b> |    This is the northernmost end of a great hall which extends into
<b>Floyd</b> | darkness southward.  The underground river rushes past at the hall's
<b>Floyd</b> | northern edge.  The water's turbulent churning fills this place with
<b>Floyd</b> | near-deafening noise.  An ancient, wooden waterwheel stands alongside
<b>Floyd</b> | the river in a narrow channel carved into the stone floor.  River water
<b>Floyd</b> | flows swiftly through the channel and splashes noisily past the
<b>Floyd</b> | stationary wheel.  A great iron chain hangs down from the ceiling and
<b>Floyd</b> | is wound tightly around the wheel's great axle.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | As you leave, the unsupported flow-control gate slips shut, cutting off
<b>Floyd</b> | the flow of water past the waterwheel.  Once the water ceases flowing,
<b>Floyd</b> | the great wheel creaks and shudders to a halt.  The iron chain wrapped
<b>Floyd</b> | around the wheel's axle is drawn back up into the ceiling and the wheel
<b>Floyd</b> | begins to turn in reverse, splashing water onto the floor and walls.
<b>Floyd</b> | Again you hear the grinding sound coming from the southern end of the
<b>Floyd</b> | hall.  The distant grinding terminates with a resonating thump and the
<b>Floyd</b> | great chain falls slack.  The loops of chain wound around the axle
<b>Floyd</b> | tumble noisily onto the floor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You leap into the raging river's churning waters and are swept away by
<b>Floyd</b> | the powerful current.  Just downstream from the great hall, a small
<b>Floyd</b> | grotto has formed where the river has eroded away the solid stone.  You
<b>Floyd</b> | make a futile attempt to swim toward the grotto, but the current is far
<b>Floyd</b> | too swift.  Your battle to keep your head above the churning surface
<b>Floyd</b> | ends suddenly when you strike your skull sharply against a submerged
<b>Floyd</b> | rock, and all becomes black...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You awaken suddenly, your head hammering with pain.  You have no idea
<b>Floyd</b> | where you are, but you are no longer buffetted by the icy river and
<b>Floyd</b> | your clothing is dry. You have no clear recollection of how you arrived
<b>Floyd</b> | in this place, but you seem to remember a sudden flash of daylight...
<b>Floyd</b> | an arm reaching down, plucking you out of the water, dragging you back
<b>Floyd</b> | into darkness...  a grim, bearded face looking down upon you -
<b>Floyd</b> | unmoving...  tunnels, passages, twisting, turning, climbing...

<b>Floyd</b> | Stone Altar
<b>Floyd</b> |    This space was hollowed out of the solid stone of the mountain,

<b>Floyd</b> | set on the floor at its southernmost end.  A metal chime, heavily
<b>Floyd</b> | corroded after centuries of neglect, hangs from a stand mounted at one
<b>Floyd</b> | of its ends.  A rivulet of clear water splashes into the room through a
<b>Floyd</b> | doorway that enters from the north.  The stream flows placidly down the
<b>Floyd</b> | room's length and disappears through an iron grate set in the floor
<b>Floyd</b> | just in front of the altar.

<b>Floyd</b> | rock.  Just below you, the great river, having coursed through the
<b>Floyd</b> | mountain's darkest depths, spills jubilantly over the cliff's edge with
<b>Floyd</b> | a parting hiss, and plunges into the great valley far below.  An
<b>Floyd</b> | incredible landscape sprawls out before you.  Thick forests stretch
<b>Floyd</b> | away into the distance, carpeting rolling hills that climb gradually
<b>Floyd</b> | toward another range of mighty peaks which you can just make out,
<b>Floyd</b> | purple-gray in the mid-day haze.  The river, having finally tumbled
<b>Floyd</b> | down from its great height, bends southward, winds its way into the
<b>Floyd</b> | dense trees and disappears.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A life-size statue of an armed watchman sits pensively at the far right
<b>Floyd</b> | end of the balcony.  The dreary blackness of the tunnel's dark opening
<b>Floyd</b> | leads back into the mountain, westward.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The blackness seems to close in upon you, choking the breath from your
<b>Floyd</b> | lungs.  Your heart hammers wildly in your chest.  The fear of dying,
<b>Floyd</b> | cold and alone deep in the bowels of the earth, suddenly grips you and
<b>Floyd</b> | holds you in its icy claws.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An intensely bright beam of brilliant, white light suddenly blasts
<b>Floyd</b> | upward from within the well, and reflects off the mirror's polished

<b>Floyd</b> | lesser bruin etched on the floor, midway between the well and the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The blinding light slowly begins to change.  It becomes a softer, blue
<b>Floyd</b> | color, streaked here and there with rays of gold and red.  The beam of
<b>Floyd</b> | light illuminates the haze of sweet-smelling smoke that has drifted
<b>Floyd</b> | into the chamber from the north.  The billowing smoke seems to gather
<b>Floyd</b> | in upon itself, as though it were attracted to the beautiful light by
<b>Floyd</b> | some unseen force.  The smoke begins to swirl and churn within the beam
<b>Floyd</b> | of light, casting weird, sinuous shadows about the room.  It coalesces
<b>Floyd</b> | further into a tiny thunderstorm of brilliant color and flashing light.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You notice a low, humming sound that fills the chamber, echoing wildly
<b>Floyd</b> | off the dark stone walls.  The humming becomes a loud whirring as the
<b>Floyd</b> | iridescent colors flash faster and faster.  The whirring increases to a
<b>Floyd</b> | near deafening roar.  The cloud of smoke thrums and pulses with
<b>Floyd</b> | blinding bursts of intensely colored light.  You clap your hands over
<b>Floyd</b> | your ears, attempting vainly to shut out the thunderous din, but it is
<b>Floyd</b> | of no use.  The tumult of sound and explosion of light seem ready to
<b>Floyd</b> | rend the very stone walls with their fury.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With an incredibly powerful thump that vibrates you to the bone, all
<b>Floyd</b> | falls silent and the maelstrom of light calms to a steady glow.  Within
<b>Floyd</b> | the cloud of smoke, a beautiful, feminine face appears.  You draw in a
<b>Floyd</b> | sharp breath as you finally behold the oracle.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is a face of delicate beauty and timeless wisdom.  It is a face that
<b>Floyd</b> | has seen the birth of the world, and bears the weighty knowledge of the
<b>Floyd</b> | hour of its death.  The oracle regards you contemplatively for a
<b>Floyd</b> | moment.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    "You have travelled far to see me," her silken voice rolls forth
<b>Floyd</b> | like a wave crashing on some distant shore.  It is a voice of wonder,
<b>Floyd</b> | of horror.  It is the voice of dreams fulfilled.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    "I have watched the plight of your people, I know the great peril
<b>Floyd</b> | that lies before them..."  Her voice trails away like the falling of
<b>Floyd</b> | autumn leaves.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    "I have not the power to deliver your people from this plight."  She
<b>Floyd</b> | says with an expression of pensive sorrow.  "A new age is opening in
<b>Floyd</b> | the world, and the age past must fade away; along with it, my power in
<b>Floyd</b> | the world fades as well.  Already, you have seen the signs of this
<b>Floyd</b> | changing.  Mankind no longer seeks out the wisdom of the great ones.

<b>Floyd</b> | come to a close."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A wooden staff appears on the floor before the oracle.  "Take this,"
<b>Floyd</b> | she says softly, her voice beginning to fade, "I cannot deliver your
<b>Floyd</b> | homeland, but with this gift you can set yourselves free."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The wondrous face hangs in the air for a long moment, the features
<b>Floyd</b> | growing less distinct as the cloud of smoke gradually diffuses.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | beam of light dwindles away and finally disappears completely.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The drums of war have beaten long throughout the land of your
<b>Floyd</b> | forefathers.  At night, the fiendish glow of enemy campfires has shone
<b>Floyd</b> | orange and horrible on the horizon for as many years as you can recall.
<b>Floyd</b> | The warriors of your land have battled long and valiantly against the
<b>Floyd</b> | demon hordes pressing relentlessly forward, assailing your
<b>Floyd</b> | ever-diminishing borders.  The fight has been mighty, but the strength
<b>Floyd</b> | of your people has begun to wane.  Only a few of the warriors remain to
<b>Floyd</b> | lead the rag-tag brigades of youthful peasants into battle.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The council of elders has seen that it is not long before the invaders
<b>Floyd</b> | will breach the skirmish lines and plunder the farms and villages of
<b>Floyd</b> | your homeland.  The council has decreed that after centuries of
<b>Floyd</b> | silence, the voice of the great oracle must be heard once more if this
<b>Floyd</b> | horrible foe is to be repelled.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Barely old enough to follow the warriors into battle, you were filled
<b>Floyd</b> | with great pride when you were selected as the messenger who would be
<b>Floyd</b> | sent to beg the great oracle for her counsel.  The elders summoned you
<b>Floyd</b> | into the great hall, admonishing you to stay on the old path leading
<b>Floyd</b> | into the high mountains.  After precious few other words of
<b>Floyd</b> | instruction, they sent you on your way.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For many days now, you have trod the ancient trail, winding higher and
<b>Floyd</b> | higher into the rugged peaks of the Black Mountains.  Cold, hungry and
<b>Floyd</b> | alone, you somehow sense that you are nearing the oracle's hiding place
<b>Floyd</b> | deep within the great mountain.  At last, the crumbling path fades away
<b>Floyd</b> | at the foot of a vast wall of solid rock

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Cliff Base
<b>Floyd</b> |    The greatest peak of the Black Mountains rises sharply before you;
<b>Floyd</b> | an impenetrable dagger of dark granite jutting high into the clouds
<b>Floyd</b> | above.  You stand at the base of an immense cliff, where a deep alcove
<b>Floyd</b> | has been chiseled from the living rock.  It almost appears to be the
<b>Floyd</b> | yawning mouth of a great, black cave.  As you stand at its entrance you
<b>Floyd</b> | can see steps cut from the jagged stone, leading southward into the
<b>Floyd</b> | bowels of the mountain.

<b>Floyd</b> | Hall of the Cherubim
<b>Floyd</b> |    Along the northern wall of this great hall stand three massive
<b>Floyd</b> | bronze cherubim, each at least the height of three men.  Their mighty
<b>Floyd</b> | wings are swept forward, covering their respectfully downturned faces.
<b>Floyd</b> | The powerful arms of each statue are extended forward:  the first grips
<b>Floyd</b> | the axle of a bronze wheel suspended between his clenched fists; the
<b>Floyd</b> | second holds a brass censer from which pungent, sweet-smelling smoke
<b>Floyd</b> | escapes, filling the chamber with an aromatic, bluish haze; the third
<b>Floyd</b> | cups a copper sphere in his upturned palms.  The three seem to be
<b>Floyd</b> | bowing deferentially toward an ornate archway leading southward.
<b>Floyd</b> | Another archway leads back to the west.  A ceremonial chest sits in the
<b>Floyd</b> | southeastern corner.
<b>Floyd</b> |    The brass censer seems to contain a burning block of incense.

<b>Floyd</b> | near-deafening noise.  An ancient, wooden waterwheel stands alongside
<b>Floyd</b> | the river in a narrow channel carved into the stone floor.  River water
<b>Floyd</b> | flows swiftly through the channel and splashes noisily past the

<b>Floyd</b> | begins to turn in reverse, splashing water onto the floor and walls.
<b>Floyd</b> | Again you hear the grinding sound coming from the southern end of the

<b>Floyd</b> | great chain falls slack.  The loops of chain wound around the axle
<b>Floyd</b> | tumble noisily onto the floor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You leap into the raging river's churning waters and are swept away by
<b>Floyd</b> | the powerful current.  Just downstream from the great hall, a small
<b>Floyd</b> | grotto has formed where the river has eroded away the solid stone.  You
<b>Floyd</b> | make a futile attempt to swim toward the grotto, but the current is far
<b>Floyd</b> | too swift.  Your battle to keep your head above the churning surface
<b>Floyd</b> | ends suddenly when you strike your skull sharply against a submerged
<b>Floyd</b> | rock, and all becomes black...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You awaken suddenly, your head hammering with pain.  You have no idea
<b>Floyd</b> | where you are, but you are no longer buffetted by the icy river and
<b>Floyd</b> | your clothing is dry. You have no clear recollection of how you arrived
<b>Floyd</b> | in this place, but you seem to remember a sudden flash of daylight...
<b>Floyd</b> | an arm reaching down, plucking you out of the water, dragging you back

<b>Floyd</b> | Stone Altar
<b>Floyd</b> |    This space was hollowed out of the solid stone of the mountain,
<b>Floyd</b> | chisel-marks from the ancient laborers can still be seen on its rough
<b>Floyd</b> | hewn walls.  The room is slightly oval shaped with a squat, stone altar
<b>Floyd</b> | set on the floor at its southernmost end.  A metal chime, heavily
<b>Floyd</b> | corroded after centuries of neglect, hangs from a stand mounted at one
<b>Floyd</b> | of its ends.  A rivulet of clear water splashes into the room through a
<b>Floyd</b> | doorway that enters from the north.  The stream flows placidly down the
<b>Floyd</b> | room's length and disappears through an iron grate set in the floor
<b>Floyd</b> | just in front of the altar.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An open archway exits eastward.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Sitting on the stone altar is a rusted sword.

<b>Floyd</b> | cold and alone deep in the bowels of the earth, suddenly grips you and

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An intensely bright beam of brilliant, white light suddenly blasts

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The blinding light slowly begins to change.  It becomes a softer, blue
<b>Floyd</b> | color, streaked here and there with rays of gold and red.  The beam of
<b>Floyd</b> | light illuminates the haze of sweet-smelling smoke that has drifted
<b>Floyd</b> | into the chamber from the north.  The billowing smoke seems to gather
<b>Floyd</b> | in upon itself, as though it were attracted to the beautiful light by
<b>Floyd</b> | some unseen force.  The smoke begins to swirl and churn within the beam
<b>Floyd</b> | of light, casting weird, sinuous shadows about the room.  It coalesces
<b>Floyd</b> | further into a tiny thunderstorm of brilliant color and flashing light.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You notice a low, humming sound that fills the chamber, echoing wildly
<b>Floyd</b> | off the dark stone walls.  The humming becomes a loud whirring as the
<b>Floyd</b> | iridescent colors flash faster and faster.  The whirring increases to a
<b>Floyd</b> | near deafening roar.  The cloud of smoke thrums and pulses with
<b>Floyd</b> | blinding bursts of intensely colored light.  You clap your hands over
<b>Floyd</b> | your ears, attempting vainly to shut out the thunderous din, but it is
<b>Floyd</b> | of no use.  The tumult of sound and explosion of light seem ready to
<b>Floyd</b> | rend the very stone walls with their fury.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With an incredibly powerful thump that vibrates you to the bone, all
<b>Floyd</b> | falls silent and the maelstrom of light calms to a steady glow.  Within
<b>Floyd</b> | the cloud of smoke, a beautiful, feminine face appears.  You draw in a
<b>Floyd</b> | sharp breath as you finally behold the oracle.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is a face of delicate beauty and timeless wisdom.  It is a face that
<b>Floyd</b> | has seen the birth of the world, and bears the weighty knowledge of the
<b>Floyd</b> | hour of its death.  The oracle regards you contemplatively for a
<b>Floyd</b> | moment.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    "You have travelled far to see me," her silken voice rolls forth
<b>Floyd</b> | like a wave crashing on some distant shore.  It is a voice of wonder,
<b>Floyd</b> | of horror.  It is the voice of dreams fulfilled.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    "I have watched the plight of your people, I know the great peril
<b>Floyd</b> | that lies before them..."  Her voice trails away like the falling of
<b>Floyd</b> | autumn leaves.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    "I have not the power to deliver your people from this plight."  She
<b>Floyd</b> | says with an expression of pensive sorrow.  "A new age is opening in
<b>Floyd</b> | the world, and the age past must fade away; along with it, my power in
<b>Floyd</b> | the world fades as well.  Already, you have seen the signs of this
<b>Floyd</b> | changing.  Mankind no longer seeks out the wisdom of the great ones.

<b>Floyd</b> | come to a close."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A wooden staff appears on the floor before the oracle.  "Take this,"
<b>Floyd</b> | she says softly, her voice beginning to fade, "I cannot deliver your
<b>Floyd</b> | homeland, but with this gift you can set yourselves free."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The wondrous face hangs in the air for a long moment, the features
<b>Floyd</b> | growing less distinct as the cloud of smoke gradually diffuses.  The
