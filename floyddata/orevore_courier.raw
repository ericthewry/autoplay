The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Orevore Courier</i>, written by Brian Rapp.  <I>Orevore Courier</I> was originally released as part of the 2007 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took eighth place. It went on to be nominated for a Best Individual Puzzle Xyzzy Award.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Orevore_Courier'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | The OKAY button is blinking again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Its ridiculously bright yellow light makes everyone in the room appear
<b>Floyd</b> | to be suffering from inttermittent jaundice.  Fortunately you're the
<b>Floyd</b> | only one in the room, because there's no room in here for anyone else.
<b>Floyd</b> | The OKAY button is also buzzing, with the patented Elevated
<b>Floyd</b> | Responsiveness Tone guaranteed to remain irritating no matter how
<b>Floyd</b> | often one is forced to hear it.  Somehow the most annoying part,
<b>Floyd</b> | though, is that the blinking and the buzzing are slightly out of sync.

</TD><td></td><TD><b>Ferret</b>  says, "As the author of "Orevore Courier", I am both delighted and terrified to be here for this episode of Club  Floyd.  I'll try not to interfere in the course of play, but the game is famously cruel and unusual, so here's some advice before you get started.  Please familiarize yourself with the "feelies" which show the layout of the ship and your security console.  If you don't know what the buttons do, you can play with them for the first 20 turns or so, provided you can withstand the Elevated Responsiveness Tone without pressing the OKAY button.  Expect to lose on your first umpteen attempts ? it's just that kind of game.  Try to pay attention to what's going on in each of the ship's areas, so that you can learn something new from each of your failures.  Have fun watching the carnage, and be thankful that you don't serve as Security Officer on an Orevore Courier in real life."
