The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <I>Pigpancake</I> by Aubra Penner, <I>Moonwrecked</I> by Colin Sandel and Carolyn VanEseltine, <I>Hangar 22</I> by Rob O'Hara, and <I>Ecto Horror</I> by Jon Blask (writing as "Roody Yogurt").  The only real common thread between these games is that they were all originally released during 2011.  You can learn more about these games, including how to download them, by visiting their sites on the ifWiki: <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Pigpancake'><u>Pi</u>gp<u>ancake</u></A>, <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Moonwrecked'><u>Moonwrecked</u></A>, <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Hangar_22'><u>Han</u>g<u>ar 22</u></A>, and <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Ecto_Horror'><u>Ecto Horror</u></A>.</br></br>

<b>Floyd</b> | corporation, an exploratory rival to your own employer. You prepare to
<b>Floyd</b> | sprint to your own buggy, only to discover that it has been badly
<b>Floyd</b> | damaged.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Someone, likely the "man in distress" whom you just tried to save, has
<b>Floyd</b> | taken a plasma welder to your buggy. Its tires and radio are completely

<b>Floyd</b> | shuttle floating overhead.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You look up at the shuttle, plainly visible in the earthlight but too
<b>Floyd</b> | far away to stand any chance of seeing you. You turn back toward the
<b>Floyd</b> | retreating form of the rover, barely visible now. Assured now that you
<b>Floyd</b> | will be stranded here for hours before the shuttle begins to worry
<b>Floyd</b> | about your safety, Titan will report exclusive discovery of this ruin,
<b>Floyd</b> | leaving you and your company in the dust.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | It is the hottest summer of all time (or at least it feels that way now
<b>Floyd</b> | that your electricity has been cut off). Your lack of employment has
<b>Floyd</b> | finally caught up with you. Your funds have been depleted and your
<b>Floyd</b> | pockets are empty. Last month's essentials (cable television and
<b>Floyd</b> | Internet access) are now but sweet memories. The lack of air
<b>Floyd</b> | conditioning feels like the final straw. You were really hoping to
<b>Floyd</b> | starve to death at a comfortable 68 degrees.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Yesterday for lunch you boiled and ate two hot dog wieners. For dinner,
<b>Floyd</b> | you drank the water you boiled them in. (Mmm, "Hot Dog Soup".) So far
<b>Floyd</b> | your dignity has kept you from rummaging through trash cans for food,
<b>Floyd</b> | but it's starting to sound like a viable option. Just the thought of
<b>Floyd</b> | sinking your teeth into someone else's left over pizza crust makes your
<b>Floyd</b> | mouth water.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The current economy has made it hell for a spoiled, out-of-work
<b>Floyd</b> | computer programmer such as yourself to find work.  It wasn't too long
<b>Floyd</b> | ago that a five-figure salary seemed beneath you; today, given your

<b>Floyd</b> | Welcome to HANGAR 22, an exciting new text adventure written by Rob
<b>Floyd</b> | O'Hara. Perhaps "exciting" is an overstatement (and heck, it's not even
<b>Floyd</b> | all that original!), but regardless, I hope you enjoy playing it as
<b>Floyd</b> | much as I enjoyed creating it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hangar 22 was written using Inform 6. Despite my best efforts, you may
<b>Floyd</b> | find minor glitches as the two of us move through this game together.
<b>Floyd</b> | As I once asked of my prison cellmate, "Go easy on me." (He didn't.)
<b>Floyd</b> | For the record, I believe Hangar 22 qualifies as a "text adventure" and
<b>Floyd</b> | not "interactive fiction". I'm afraid you'll find no deep literary
<b>Floyd</b> | meaning here. My personal gaming experience with the medium lies in
<b>Floyd</b> | old-school text adventures, and the design of this game directly
<b>Floyd</b> | reflects that.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hangar 22's scoring system is very simplistic, and revolves around the
<b>Floyd</b> | completion of tasks. This results overall in a low scoring game, but
<b>Floyd</b> | based on your score you should be able to tell how many major tasks you
<b>Floyd</b> | have completed and how many you have left. The game contains a total of
<b>Floyd</b> | 11 points. To truly win the game, you will need to acquire all 11
<b>Floyd</b> | points.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hangar 22 uses Brendan Barnwell's OKBScript for its menu-driven
<b>Floyd</b> | dialogue. Whenever you encounter a person you wish to speak with,
<b>Floyd</b> | simply type TALK TO NAME ("NAME" being the person's name) and you will
<b>Floyd</b> | be presented with a list of things you can say to the person. I am not
<b>Floyd</b> | completely sold on menu-style dialogue in text adventures, but as a
<b>Floyd</b> | first time author I thought it sounded easier to program. You can also
<b>Floyd</b> | talk to some objects.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hangar 22 supports the commands HELP (or HINT) and CHEAT. By typing
<b>Floyd</b> | HELP or HINT and hitting ENTER, the game will give you a hint that
<b>Floyd</b> | should nudge you in the right direction. For additional assistance,
<b>Floyd</b> | type CHEAT. You can try this with many objects as well (HINT COUCH or
<b>Floyd</b> | CHEAT PENCIL). Both HELP/HINT and CHEAT may reveal game spoilers, so
<b>Floyd</b> | don't use them unless you're really stuck! If you mess up, UNDO undoes
<b>Floyd</b> | the last command you just typed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hangar 22 was beta-tested by Robb Sherwin, Jeff Martin, Ian Morris, Joe
<b>Floyd</b> | Ratulowski, Matt Roark, NZ17, Seth Spurlock, and multiple members of
<b>Floyd</b> | the Jolt Country and Gas Chamber forums. I could not have completed
<b>Floyd</b> | this game without Robb Sherwin's assistance. Thanks again, Robb!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Work on Hangar 22 began in September of 2010 and was completed in April
<b>Floyd</b> | of 2011. I grew up playing text adventures in the late 70s, stopped in
<b>Floyd</b> | the mid-80s, and had my interest rekindled by Jason Scott's documentary
<b>Floyd</b> | Get Lamp. Hangar 22 is dedicated to Jason Scott, Robb Sherwin, Sam
<b>Floyd</b> | Patterson, Scott Adams, and my dad, Denny O'Hara, who introduced me to
<b>Floyd</b> | my first text adventure at the age of seven. Thanks to everyone still
<b>Floyd</b> | writing Interactive Fiction games, and most of all, special thanks to
<b>Floyd</b> | YOU for PLAYING THIS ONE.

<b>Floyd</b> | As the two of you jump into your trusty ride the mob begins to pour out
<b>Floyd</b> | of the building, waving wrenches and hammers and pitchforks in the air.
<b>Floyd</b> | As your brain pauses for a moment to wonder why astronauts and
<b>Floyd</b> | government officials would have pitchforks at their disposal, Arf takes

<b>Floyd</b> | row of tire spikes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I got this," says Arf, and with that the El Camino begins to lift up
<b>Floyd</b> | off the ground, sailing up and over the row of tire-shredding spike
<b>Floyd</b> | strips. (It should be noted that on any other day, there would have
<b>Floyd</b> | been an armed security guard standing inside the guard shack ready to
<b>Floyd</b> | shoot you. On this particular day however, that guard is sitting in a
<b>Floyd</b> | Porta-Potty one hundred yards away, wondering why on earth he decided

<b>Floyd</b> | "Know any good taco stands?" he asks.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ah jeez man, let's go," says Arf. You assure him that it's cool and
<b>Floyd</b> | that these are good people, but Arf continues to slump down in his
<b>Floyd</b> | seat. It is then that you hear a voice, an angelic voice you've known
<b>Floyd</b> | for years.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Arfie? Arfie, is that you in there?" says Gloria from the drive-thru
<b>Floyd</b> | window. "Oh Arfie! I just KNEW you would come back!" Gloria climbs out
<b>Floyd</b> | the drive-thru window, pregnant as ever, with a suitcase in her hand.
<b>Floyd</b> | "I TOLD you," she shouts back at the workers still standing in the
<b>Floyd</b> | drive-thru window. "I TOLD you my baby daddy would come back!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Wait ..." you say. "You ... and HER?" you ask Arf in disbelief.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "What can I say," he says, shrugging his shoulders. "Chicks love a dude
<b>Floyd</b> | with a UFO."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh, Arfie baby" says Gloria as she climbs into the passenger seat,
<b>Floyd</b> | forcing Arf to scoot closer to you. "Heeeeey, Glo-bean," he says,
<b>Floyd</b> | faking a little gray smile. Gloria begins kissing Arf on the cheek.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Didja miss me? Didja? Didja? Oh, it's so good to see you! Finally, we
<b>Floyd</b> | can settle down! Just me, you, Arfie junior, and ... wait, how do you
<b>Floyd</b> | know the stupid coupon guy?" she says, looking at you. "And why is he
<b>Floyd</b> | wearing a goldfish bowl on his head?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It's a long story," says Arf as the front end of the El Camino begins
<b>Floyd</b> | to lift up off the ground. "Say, is that a Sir Guide-A-Lot 350 GPS? I
<b>Floyd</b> | have one just like it in my ship! Sir Guide-A-Lot?" says Arf.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yo, yo, yo," says Sir Guide-A-Lot 350.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Take us to Mzzrxklpletic-405, please."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Aw yeah, BABY GOT BACK!" responds Sir Guide-A-Lot.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You hand Arf the "World's Greatest Dad" mug. "I think this belongs to

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And with that, the El Camino, with you behind the wheel, Gloria using
