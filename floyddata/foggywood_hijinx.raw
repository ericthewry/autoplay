<b>Floyd</b> | Copyright (c) 1993, 2006 by Michael J. Roberts.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Poor Uncle Foggy.  He was the best guardian any kid could ever ask for.
<b>Floyd</b> | After your parents died in that freak waterbed accident, Uncle Foggy
<b>Floyd</b> | practically raised you and your twin sister Winnie.  You grew up in his
<b>Floyd</b> | home full of wacky inventions - practical jokes for all occasions.
<b>Floyd</b> | Uncle Foggy was a prankster, no two ways about it.  It's only been a
<b>Floyd</b> | couple of years since you and Winnie left for college.  Since then
<b>Floyd</b> | you've spoken far too infrequently.  When you last spoke, Uncle Foggy
<b>Floyd</b> | rambled on and on about some ultimate practical joke, but you had a
<b>Floyd</b> | class on gallinaceous theology to get to.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You and Winnie pull in to Foggywood Estate in your beaten-up coupe.
<b>Floyd</b> | The white picket gate swings quietly shut behind you as you kill the
<b>Floyd</b> | engine.  Unfortunately your relatives, the Barnevelders from Rhode
<b>Floyd</b> | Island, have also just arrived.  Uncle Orpington and Aunt Lamona are
<b>Floyd</b> | just climbing out of their gleaming black sedan, while your cousin
<b>Floyd</b> | 'Red' sits in his ridiculous monster truck and leans on the horn, which
<b>Floyd</b> | blares an ear splitting rendition of 'La Cucharacha.'
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Not a very auspicious way to kick off the reading of Uncle Foggy's
<b>Floyd</b> | will, is it?

<b>Floyd</b> | Uncle Foggy's front lawn teeters just on the border of ill-kempt,
<b>Floyd</b> | though no one specific flaw draws attention.  The three vehicles parked

<b>Floyd</b> | Manor, lies to the north, while the gate through which you entered
<b>Floyd</b> | rests back to the south.  Though you can't see it over the hedges, you
<b>Floyd</b> | know that beyond the gate and across the road lies the ramshackle cabin
<b>Floyd</b> | that Uncle Foggy called his lab.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Barnevelders are here, standing by the front door with you and

<b>Floyd</b> | almost psychic bond.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You and your relatives dutifully troop into the house after Dorkings.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Foyer
<b>Floyd</b> | Uncle Foggy's foyer is tastefully decorated, even if the blue hen
<b>Floyd</b> | wallpaper does seem a bit queer.  Passages from the foyer lead off in
<b>Floyd</b> | many directions, but your only business here today is in the study to
<b>Floyd</b> | the east.  The walls are adorned with glossy photos taken around Uncle
<b>Floyd</b> | Foggy's favorite travel destination.  Nailed to a chest-high post is a
<b>Floyd</b> | stuffed bird, eternally caught in its morning salutation to the sun.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Barnevelders are here, waiting to be admitted into the study with
<b>Floyd</b> | you and Winnie.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "We will be adjourning in the study for the reading of...  " He breaks
<b>Floyd</b> | off in mid-sentence and cocks his head towards the study.  You listen
<b>Floyd</b> | carefully, and hear what sounds like polite applause.  Dorkings turns
<b>Floyd</b> | back to all of you and says, "Mm.  Please wait here while I ensure that
<b>Floyd</b> | all is in readiness," before disappearing into the study.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Odd, you think.  Knowing Dorkings, he would have checked and double
<b>Floyd</b> | checked everything long before your arrival.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After a brief moment you hear rising voices.  Well, one voice anyway.
<b>Floyd</b> | Dorkings' tone never rises or falls, but the other voice sounds like...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Mrs.  Faverolles, the cook, storms out of the study, slamming the door
<b>Floyd</b> | against the wall.  You can see from her complexion that she's at full
<b>Floyd</b> | broil.  Ignoring your party, she whirls around and hurls a string of
<b>Floyd</b> | incomprehensible French epithets towards the study, waving a sauce
<b>Floyd</b> | spattered spoon in one hammy fist.  Her other hand clenches a saucepan

<b>Floyd</b> | Mrs.  Faverolles storms off toward the kitchen, still raging.  Once the
<b>Floyd</b> | noise of her passage has quieted, Dorkings gestures your party into the
<b>Floyd</b> | study.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You and your relatives shuffle inside and take seats at opposite sides
<b>Floyd</b> | of the room.  You and Winnie fill out the love seat, while the
<b>Floyd</b> | Barnevelders perch like chicken hawks on the matching sofa.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Study
<b>Floyd</b> | Light from the outside streams in through the closed window,
<b>Floyd</b> | illuminating Uncle Foggy's comfortably cluttered study.  It's full of
<b>Floyd</b> | interesting odds and ends, not the least of which is the trophy mounted
<b>Floyd</b> | on the wall above the desk.  Many were the times that you and Winnie
<b>Floyd</b> | would climb the bookshelves in search of written treasure, and then
<b>Floyd</b> | spread out by the fireplace with your latest finds.  For more dexterous
<b>Floyd</b> | pleasures, there was the carton of assorted works in progress Uncle
<b>Floyd</b> | Foggy usually kept beneath his desk.  If nothing else appealed,
<b>Floyd</b> | sneaking maraschino cherries from the bar was always good for a few
<b>Floyd</b> | giggles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Barnevelders are here, seated on the couch across from you and
<b>Floyd</b> | Winnie, while Mr.  Dorkings stands beside the desk.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You notice that an integrated television/video player has been set up
<b>Floyd</b> | on Uncle Foggy's desk, about where Uncle Foggy would be if he were
<b>Floyd</b> | presiding.

<b>Floyd</b> | head with thick horns mounted as far apart as a broad man's shoulders.
<b>Floyd</b> | As you know, it rests on a tightly coiled spring, and launches forward
<b>Floyd</b> | at the touch of a button hidden on the desk.  Uncle Foggy favored using
<b>Floyd</b> | the device on unsolicited salesmen and IRS auditors.  He would seat
<b>Floyd</b> | them before the desk, wait until they were deeply engrossed in
<b>Floyd</b> | business, and then...  SPROI-OI-OING!  The huge head would lunge
<b>Floyd</b> | towards them at high velocity while Uncle Foggy screamed, "It's still
<b>Floyd</b> | alive!  Run!  For the love of God, RUN!"  Then he'd cackle hysterically
<b>Floyd</b> | as they tripped over themselves in their rush for the door.  Needless
<b>Floyd</b> | to say, victims of this prank rarely returned.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Just a moment more.  Mm," says Dorkings, as he turns to the
<b>Floyd</b> | television.  Your mind wanders, and you find yourself focusing on the
<b>Floyd</b> | Buffalo-On-A-Spring (pat.  pending) mounted on the wall behind Uncle
<b>Floyd</b> | Foggy's desk.  It was one of Uncle Foggy's funniest inventions, a

<b>Floyd</b> | suh?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ah, mm.  Yes."  Dorkings retrieves a black shammy sack from the desk
<b>Floyd</b> | and loosens the cord binding it shut.  Reaching inside, he pulls out a
<b>Floyd</b> | matte black pyramidal object with a small switch at its apex.  You jerk
<b>Floyd</b> | instinctively as Dorkings fumbles with the strange object.  Everything
<b>Floyd</b> | slows as you watch it tumble to the ground with inexplicable dread.  It
<b>Floyd</b> | lands on the shag rug with a faint but sickening 'click.'
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Suddenly the world seems larger.  You look to Winnie for help only to
<b>Floyd</b> | find...  a chicken!  Staring back at you is a perfectly normal white
<b>Floyd</b> | crested hen!  You look around.  Oh, no.  Where once stood Mr.  Dorkings
<b>Floyd</b> | and your relations, now you see only chickens.  A long moment of
<b>Floyd</b> | stunned silence follows, as the room's occupants glance around
<b>Floyd</b> | nervously at each other.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The silence is broken by Uncle Foggy's booming voice.  "You got it yet
<b>Floyd</b> | Dorkings?  Good.  Now, what you got here is my latest invention.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | ultimate, Ah say, the ULTIMATE practical joke!  Great at parties!
<b>Floyd</b> | It'll make a million, if my name isn't Fogarth Barnevelder!  And the

<b>Floyd</b> | any time now.  My, Ah say, my job here is done."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As the implications of the situation sink in, there is a sudden tidal
<b>Floyd</b> | swell of panic.  Someone - Aunt Lamona?  Cousin Red?  - leaps from
<b>Floyd</b> | their perch and sets up a dreadful squawking.  Soon, the room is full
<b>Floyd</b> | of squawking, screaching birds running in panicked circles, feathers
<b>Floyd</b> | flying everywhere.

<b>Floyd</b> | The cacophany is broken by a sudden click as loud as the hammer of a

<b>Floyd</b> | Much later, you and Winnie sit down to a sumptuous dinner prepared by
<b>Floyd</b> | Mrs.  Faverolles.  You're both able to laugh over the day's events from
<b>Floyd</b> | the comfortable safety of Uncle Foggy's expansive dining room.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    "What a day!"  you exclaim to Winnie between mouthfuls.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "I know," she says, sipping a glass of wine.  "I thought we would
<b>Floyd</b> | never find a way to revert to our old selves."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Too bad about the Barnevelders missing their chance to participate
<b>Floyd</b> | in the scavenger hunt."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Oh, yes," nods Winnie.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "So.  How are you finding the chicken?"  you ask, changing the
<b>Floyd</b> | subject.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Mm, it's a big stringy for my tastes."  says Winnie, chewing a
<b>Floyd</b> | mouthful of food.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Really?  Mine's quite tender."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Well, you know what they say," says Winnie.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "What's that?"  you inquire.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    "It's all relative!"
