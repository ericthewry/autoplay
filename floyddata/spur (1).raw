The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Spur</i> by Kent Tessman.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/199"><u>Baf's Guide to the IF Archive</u></A>.

So, if you've never played it, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | In retrospect, maybe all that cheap whiskey last night in Grady's
<b>Floyd</b> | wasn't such a brilliant idea.  Not the way the evil, glowing orb of the
<b>Floyd</b> | morning sun is burning a hole through your squinting eyes and right
<b>Floyd</b> | into the back of your head.  And especially since there's a guy with a

<b>Floyd</b> | six-shooter on his belt, ready to draw, standing thirty feet away and
<b>Floyd</b> | facing you.  Your body keeps screaming at you that you should still be
<b>Floyd</b> | in bed.  The dimly lit cage of your memory tells you that all of this
<b>Floyd</b> | has something to do with you standing up for some woman in the saloon
<b>Floyd</b> | last night, and right now you wish like hell you could remember.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | No one ever said you were lucky, but you are...

<b>Floyd</b> | Main Street
<b>Floyd</b> |   The name might be a bit of overkill--after all, Tumbleweed Flats is a
<b>Floyd</b> | town with only one street.  The sun beats down from above, lighting up
<b>Floyd</b> | the dusty haze stretching the length of the street north and south of

<b>Floyd</b> | here.  On either side are rows of weathered wooden buildings.
<b>Floyd</b> | Immediately to the west is Lucille's General Store; to the east is
<b>Floyd</b> | Grady's Saloon, Billiards, and Hotel.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Roy Heffer is standing in front of you, his right hand dangling over
<b>Floyd</b> | his holster, fingers twitching nervously.  Somewhere in the distance,

<b>Floyd</b> | someone strums an out-of-tune Spanish guitar.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The first order of business is to get out of the abovementioned

<b>Floyd</b> | That, too, is up to you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But things also aren't going to be that simple.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You see, there's obviously a reason that you're standing on Main Street
<b>Floyd</b> | with your hand dangling over your holster and some guy you barely know

<b>Floyd</b> | facing you ten paces away and doing the same.  At least there'd better
<b>Floyd</b> | be.  And if that's the case, you'd best be finding out what it is in a

<b>Floyd</b> | complicated before long.  (You might want to keep in mind that you're
<b>Floyd</b> | not exactly John Wayne here; expert marksman, quickest draw, and

<b>Floyd</b> | Main Street
<b>Floyd</b> |   The name might be a bit of overkill--after all, Tumbleweed Flats is a
<b>Floyd</b> | town with only one street.  The sun beats down from above, lighting up
<b>Floyd</b> | the dusty haze stretching the length of the street north and south of
<b>Floyd</b> | here.  On either side are rows of weathered wooden buildings.
<b>Floyd</b> | Immediately to the west is Lucille's General Store; to the east is

<b>Floyd</b> | Grady's Saloon, Billiards, and Hotel.
<b>Floyd</b> |   Old Dan, the town drunk, is here, standing in place and swaying
<b>Floyd</b> | slightly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | North end of Main Street

<b>Floyd</b> |   Now leaving the bustling metropolis of Tumbleweed Flats, pop. 59.
<b>Floyd</b> | The local stable is off to the northwest, just north of an empty field.
<b>Floyd</b> | To the east is the north end of the hotel, although it doesn't look
<b>Floyd</b> | like you'd be able to get by the stack of crates and barrels.  A dusty
<b>Floyd</b> | road continues north out of town.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Knowing full well there's a way over the barrels and crates, you
<b>Floyd</b> | clamber awkwardly over the stack...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Narrow alley
<b>Floyd</b> |   Running along the north side of Grady's--the old wall of the building
<b>Floyd</b> | is directly behind you.  Grady's storage shed is just to the north, and

<b>Floyd</b> | Main Street is back out to the west.  You're well hidden by a stack of

<b>Floyd</b> |   The name might be a bit of overkill--after all, Tumbleweed Flats is a

<b>Floyd</b> | Immediately to the west is Lucille's General Store; to the east is

<b>Floyd</b> |   Sunlight glares in through the swinging saloonesque doors, only to be
<b>Floyd</b> | swallowed up by the murkiness inside.  Tables and chairs, barstools
<b>Floyd</b> | along the long counter, and a room-length mirror behind the bar.
<b>Floyd</b> | There's a horseshoe tacked to the wall, too.  Stairs go up to the hotel
<b>Floyd</b> | rooms on the second floor.  The billiards room, such as it is, is in
<b>Floyd</b> | the northwest corner.

<b>Floyd</b> |   Grady is behind the bar.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |   One measly pool table comprises the billiards room.  That and a

<b>Floyd</b> | Well, although you did wind up killing Roy Heffer, it was in self

<b>Floyd</b> | doesn't really count as being productive.  It would also be interesting

<b>Floyd</b> | to see who would think highly of your stealing Little Jimmy's candy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the bright side, you figured out a way to slip out of your hotel

<b>Floyd</b> | Main Street
<b>Floyd</b> |   The name might be a bit of overkill--after all, Tumbleweed Flats is a
<b>Floyd</b> | town with only one street.  The sun beats down from above, lighting up
<b>Floyd</b> | the dusty haze stretching the length of the street north and south of
<b>Floyd</b> | here.  On either side are rows of weathered wooden buildings.

<b>Floyd</b> | Immediately to the west is Lucille's General Store; to the east is
<b>Floyd</b> | Grady's Saloon, Billiards, and Hotel.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Roy Heffer is standing in front of you, his right hand dangling over
<b>Floyd</b> | his holster, fingers twitching nervously.  Somewhere in the distance,
<b>Floyd</b> | someone strums an out-of-tune Spanish guitar.

<b>Floyd</b> | South end of Main Street, on a fiery red stallion
<b>Floyd</b> |   Standing here in the middle of Main Street, you are directly across
<b>Floyd</b> | from the Tumbleweed Flats Sheriff's Department, which is directly to
<b>Floyd</b> | the east.  Not the safest place to hang out, perhaps, considering that
<b>Floyd</b> | the gallows are right on the other side of the street--and you might as
<b>Floyd</b> | well try and avoid that particular inevitability for as long as

<b>Floyd</b> | possible.  Might be a better idea to head north, back up Main Street.

<b>Floyd</b> | Well, although you did wind up killing Roy Heffer, it was in self

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the bright side, you figured out a way to slip out of your hotel

<b>Floyd</b> | Tumbleweed Flats.  Sarah races after you, with Uncle Bucky, his hands
<b>Floyd</b> | still tied, bouncing helplessly on the saddle behind her.  Looks like a

<b>Floyd</b> | rescue, cowboy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You pass across a wide mesa and slow to a stop.  Time for a
<b>Floyd</b> | well-deserved rest.  Sarah rides up behind you, and both she and Uncle
<b>Floyd</b> | Bucky dismount.  You stand there sihouetted by the light of the Western
<b>Floyd</b> | sunset, the four of you:  you, Sarah, Bucky, and a cactus.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So, how did you do?  Well, although you did wind up killing Roy Heffer,
<b>Floyd</b> | it was in self defense.  And while you did break into Grady's liquor
<b>Floyd</b> | stash, that doesn't really count as being productive.  It would also be
<b>Floyd</b> | interesting to see who would think highly of your stealing Little
<b>Floyd</b> | Jimmy's candy.  You've also managed to completely torch a hayfield.

<b>Floyd</b> | That's something, isn't it?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the bright side, you figured out a way to slip out of your hotel
<b>Floyd</b> | room unnoticed.  And putting together that plan to steal Stratford's
<b>Floyd</b> | stallion showed at least a little ingenuity.  Plus, if it weren't so
<b>Floyd</b> | seedy and practically dishonest, having wits enough to bamboozle Grady

<b>Floyd</b> | with a weed looking like a four-leaf clover would almost be
<b>Floyd</b> | commendable.  Maybe you deserve some points for managing to construct a
<b>Floyd</b> | bomb out of an empty whiskey bottle and the most volatile hootch on the
<b>Floyd</b> | planet.  (Or maybe not.)  But maybe it's the score that tells the story
<b>Floyd</b> | in the end--you:  2, the Heffer family:  0.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | So somewhere along the way you managed to become a genuine Western
<b>Floyd</b> | hero, up there with John Wayne and Roy Rogers and the best of them--no
<b>Floyd</b> | small feat, that.
