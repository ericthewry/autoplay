					<span class="fontish smaller">Like ClubFloyd, the idea behind NightFloyd is that a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.<br><br>Unlike ClubFloyd, NightFloyd often takes on significantly larger works of interactive fiction, knowing going in that each one will take multiple sessions (but not always, as you'll see in this transcript). NightFloyd is also a bit more informal than ClubFloyd in that it's only announced on the ifMUD #clubfloyd bulletin board, and the time shifts around to meet player's schedules far more than ClubFloyd does. NightFloyd is organized by genericgeekgirl, aka Adri.<br>

<b>Floyd</b> | Prologue
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ...Eleven years ago...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    It's been several months since my father went away to join the war.
<b>Floyd</b> | I promised I would look after our cottage, and that I really was old
<b>Floyd</b> | enough. I've done my best to keep our cottage tidy, but the winter has
<b>Floyd</b> | been hard and I might have used more wood than I should have, trying to
<b>Floyd</b> | stay warm. Our supplies are low.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Cottage
<b>Floyd</b> | The place you call home with your father is a modest, mud-brick
<b>Floyd</b> | building with a thatched roof. There are two windows, one either side
<b>Floyd</b> | of the front door, that are framed with the lace curtains. The front
<b>Floyd</b> | door is currently standing open.
<b>Floyd</b> |    The cottage stands at the top of a narrow, wooded valley. A rough
<b>Floyd</b> | track leads south, away from your cottage, through the trees.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Nearby is a large pile of wood that needs to be chopped.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    An axe lies at your feet.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | rides out of the trees and stops not far away. Two of the men dismount.
<b>Floyd</b> | One you recognise as Lord Reken, the man who took your father away to

<b>Floyd</b> |    My studies are becoming more arduous. The honour of one day becoming
<b>Floyd</b> | a knight dangles like a carrot in front of me, just beyond my grasp. My

<b>Floyd</b> | Your personal chambers
<b>Floyd</b> | The room is not large, but adequate for your needs. There is a small
<b>Floyd</b> | window in the western wall, and a door in the eastern one. A low bed
<b>Floyd</b> | sits against the northern wall, with an unmarked wooden chest at the
<b>Floyd</b> | foot of it.
<b>Floyd</b> |    You are seated at your desk, a scroll open before you. A single
<b>Floyd</b> | candle rests in a metal holder close by, giving light to your work, but
<b>Floyd</b> | casting leaping shadows around the rest of the room.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Sitting on the desk near the scroll is a small cup.

<b>Floyd</b> |    "Now," the king continues, "it's plain that for this particular
<b>Floyd</b> | crime I can't commute it to life-imprisonment, because the laws of the
<b>Floyd</b> | kingdom demand that punishment be equivalent to the crime committed.
<b>Floyd</b> | Indeed, it's by applying the law that people can see that this kingdom

<b>Floyd</b> |    A frown forms on the face of the wizard. "But, your Majesty..."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "A curse," the king proclaims. "You will pronounce a curse on him,
<b>Floyd</b> | something that will make him unacceptable for human contact, expelling
<b>Floyd</b> | him forever from our midst."
<b>Floyd</b> |    Confusion follows. Voices are raised in dissent, others in tacit
<b>Floyd</b> | agreement, as if they like the idea, but are not sure they like it

<b>Floyd</b> |    "Peace, my lords," the king finally commands in a loud voice, and

<b>Floyd</b> | this matter. We need only for the wizard to present us with those
<b>Floyd</b> | curses he is capable of performing, and for us to decide which is the

<b>Floyd</b> |    There is reluctance from some members of the court, Lord Sulanar in

<b>Floyd</b> | most of that reluctance turns to grudging praise as the possibilities

<b>Floyd</b> | Southern end of the alley
<b>Floyd</b> | Less of an alley and more of a area left over between buildings, it
<b>Floyd</b> | stretches some distance to the north. The gap between the rear of each
<b>Floyd</b> | building is barely six feet, and from what you can see of the
<b>Floyd</b> | buildings, this is not their best side. Construction is haphazard,

<b>Floyd</b> | beside the main road.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    As you pause to survey the area, a faint shimmer of light appears a
<b>Floyd</b> | few feet away, hovering in the air. You stare at it as it shifts and

<b>Floyd</b> |    And finally, standing before you, is the ghostly image of a man.

<b>Floyd</b> |    The wraith-like man looks around, taking in his surroundings, and
<b>Floyd</b> | his eyes fall on you. You see him blink, perhaps in unbelief, and for
<b>Floyd</b> | some seconds his gaze is unwavering, piercing.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Suddenly, the phantom throws his head back and laughs. Or at least,
<b>Floyd</b> | he makes a laughing motion, for no sounds reach your ears. But you can
<b>Floyd</b> | tell he is not appreciating some clever pun or practical joke; the look
<b>Floyd</b> | in his eyes tells you he thinks of your misfortune as humorous.
<b>Floyd</b> | Somehow, this apparition knows what has happened to you, and finds the

<b>Floyd</b> |    Then, like a candle being snuffed, the ghost disappears, leaving you

<b>Floyd</b> | Interlude: Conversations with the King
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    From the moment I raised my staff and placed the curse on Torrin I
<b>Floyd</b> | knew that the king would want to speak with me, although I expected it
<b>Floyd</b> | would happen much earlier. Night has fallen now. I came at once when
<b>Floyd</b> | the servant informed me of the King's request, but Rithusar has hardly
<b>Floyd</b> | moved in the ten minutes it's been since the King's chamberlain arrived
<b>Floyd</b> | with my wine and then quietly departed, closing the door behind him.
<b>Floyd</b> | Even before then Rithusar was not entirely himself. There is something
<b>Floyd</b> | in his eyes I have never seen before. If I had to think of a word to
<b>Floyd</b> | describe how he looks, it would be "haunted".
<b>Floyd</b> |    Outside, a bitter north wind is bringing occasional sheets of rain,
<b>Floyd</b> | but mostly is just making life cold and hard, and only the most
<b>Floyd</b> | foolhardy or desperate would spend any time out in the frigid night
<b>Floyd</b> | air.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Here in the Royal apartments, the room is quiet and still, save for
<b>Floyd</b> | the crackling of the fire in the hearth before me. The flames dance
<b>Floyd</b> | over the wood, like players in some ancient ritual, jumping and
<b>Floyd</b> | twisting in delight. But although I'm seated quite close to it I still
<b>Floyd</b> | feel a chill, and I try wrapping my cloak around my shoulders a little
<b>Floyd</b> | tighter.
<b>Floyd</b> |    I know he wants to talk. It doesn't take a wizard's knowledge and
<b>Floyd</b> | perception to reach that conclusion. It also doesn't take a lot of
<b>Floyd</b> | insight to know what the king will want to talk about.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Royal apartments
<b>Floyd</b> | The wide hearth with a welcoming fire burning brightly within it gives
<b>Floyd</b> | this room a warm, comforting feel. Before the fire are two chairs, in
<b>Floyd</b> | one of which you are seated. Around the room are a number of candles,
<b>Floyd</b> | which add further light to the room. Next to your chair is a small
<b>Floyd</b> | table, while a small, silver stand is positioned next to the king's
<b>Floyd</b> | chair. The room is spacious and open, with the only exit being a door
<b>Floyd</b> | in the west wall.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Your wooden staff is leaning against your chair within easy reach.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    The king is seated in his chair, staring into the fire.

<b>Floyd</b> |    "Master Limos," you say.
<b>Floyd</b> |    The king raises his eyebrows.

<b>Floyd</b> |    There is a long pause, and you wonder if the king is going to
<b>Floyd</b> | respond at all. "I miss him," Rithusar says finally. "Part of me still
<b>Floyd</b> | can't believe he's gone."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Is that why you've ordered his rooms to be left untouched?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Yes," Rithusar answers simply. "Somehow it seems wrong to remove
<b>Floyd</b> | all of his things."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "You have to let go, Rithusar," you say. "You can't hold onto
<b>Floyd</b> | Alsanter forever."
<b>Floyd</b> |    Rithusar nods. "You're right. But not yet." He turns his gaze back
<b>Floyd</b> | towards the depths of the fire. "Not yet."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You are lost in contemplation of the fire when Rithusar breaks into
<b>Floyd</b> | your thoughts.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Why did the court find Torrin guilty?" he asks. His tone indicates
<b>Floyd</b> | that the question might be rhetorical, but you answer anyway.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "The evidence was compelling," you say.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "No, it wasn't," he replies shortly.
<b>Floyd</b> |    You hesitate to disagree and point out his lack of objectivity, but
<b>Floyd</b> | decide that wouldn't be helpful. Instead, you simply ask, "Why?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    Rithusar looks at you.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Because all the evidence didn't take into consideration Torrin's
<b>Floyd</b> | character," he replies. He leans forward, earnest in his response.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Nothing in Torrin's character suggested he would ever do something
<b>Floyd</b> | like that. Yes, looking purely at the evidence, the logical conclusion
<b>Floyd</b> | is that Torrin must have been responsible. But there is more to this
<b>Floyd</b> | than just evidence. More than just a series of facts."
<b>Floyd</b> |    Your initial reaction to this is to simply concede the point to him;
<b>Floyd</b> | he is the king, after all. But you notice again the crown sitting on
<b>Floyd</b> | the silver stand and realise that he doesn't want that sort of
<b>Floyd</b> | response.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "We don't know what's in a man's heart," you reply. "The most noble
<b>Floyd</b> | of men can be brought low by temptation, given the right opportunities.
<b>Floyd</b> | The evidence points towards a possibility that is extremely hard to
<b>Floyd</b> | disprove."
<b>Floyd</b> |    Rithusar looks thoughtful for a moment, then turns towards you and
<b>Floyd</b> | looks you in the eye.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Do you believe Torrin is guilty?" he asks.
<b>Floyd</b> |    You have to admit this was not a question you expected from
<b>Floyd</b> | Rithusar. But he is waiting for your answer.
<b>Floyd</b> | [ You can respond by saying either Yes, No, or I don't know. ]

<b>Floyd</b> |    "You'd sent for him, correct?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Yes, I wanted him to tell me what Tevona had been doing on her

<b>Floyd</b> | arrived rather breathless."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Breathless?" you reply. This wasn't information that was in the

<b>Floyd</b> |    "Sulanar explained that when the messenger had delivered the request
<b>Floyd</b> | he'd rushed see me as fast as he could because he wanted to avoid any

<b>Floyd</b> |    "That's certainly unusual," you allow.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Rithusar nods. "In a way. But it was then that he first mentioned

<b>Floyd</b> |    "Do you know where he was when the messenger found him?"

<b>Floyd</b> | Gord. He was so quick, always anticipating the outcome of events,

<b>Floyd</b> |    "I suppose that's how he managed to save you," you say.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Rithusar nods. "You weren't at the battle of Lounor, were you?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "I was close to tracking down the wizard of Gord at that point,
<b>Floyd</b> | trying to stop the creation of more of those Ralyon warriors."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "It was a dreadful battle. It was supposed to be a small outpost,
<b>Floyd</b> | one quick fight and then move on. I think King Horalas knew that, and
<b>Floyd</b> | set up a surprise. After the battle started, two squads of Ralyons
<b>Floyd</b> | materialised out of the forest behind us and attacked. We were fighting
<b>Floyd</b> | the battle on three fronts. I called for reinforcements to strengthen

<b>Floyd</b> | rest of our forces."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "And Bradda saw this happen?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "He'd seen it about to happen for a couple of minutes," Rithusar
<b>Floyd</b> | replies. "He'd been working his way towards me the whole time, bashing

<b>Floyd</b> | I think. They cut through the soldiers around me and restored the

<b>Floyd</b> |    "Was that when he died?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Yes," Rithusar says simply. "As we were organising our retreat, the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    A silence descends on the room. The logs in the fire continue to
<b>Floyd</b> | burn, the flames biting into the wood greedily.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Rithusar breaks the silence. "Can you see into the future, Rixomas?"
<b>Floyd</b> | he asks. This was not a question you expected Rithusar to ask.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Not very well," you reply. "I've never been skilled at the art of
<b>Floyd</b> | foresight, and my attempts have been about as accurate as anyone's
<b>Floyd</b> | guess."
<b>Floyd</b> |    Rithusar sighs. "I keep trying to analyse my actions, to plot the

<b>Floyd</b> | thing? What will happen to Torrin? I wish I could see what the end
<b>Floyd</b> | result will be."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "I wish I could give you what you want," you reply. "I wish I could
<b>Floyd</b> | raise my staff and recite some ancient incantation and restore your

<b>Floyd</b> | from our responsibility. You are the king of Rylane. You have a
<b>Floyd</b> | responsibility to the people to lead them and protect them. Mourn and
<b>Floyd</b> | grieve for your sons, but don't fall into depression. Don't let these
<b>Floyd</b> | things weigh you down to where your ability as a king is compromised."
<b>Floyd</b> |    Rithusar looks at you intently as he nods in agreement. His features
<b>Floyd</b> | are still gaunt, but the haunted look around his eyes has lessened
<b>Floyd</b> | somewhat, and his eyes are brighter.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "You're ever a true friend, Rixomas," he replies. "Thank you for
<b>Floyd</b> | your insights, and for taking the time to listen to my ramblings."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "It was an honour," you reply.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Rithusar stands and rings the bell. The chamberlain opens the door
<b>Floyd</b> | swiftly. You also stand, but a little unsteadily.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Are you all right?" the king asks, genuine concern in his voice.
<b>Floyd</b> |    You give a little chuckle. "I think I'm just feeling old," you
<b>Floyd</b> | reply.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Rithusar doesn't look convinced. "I'll have my physician come and

<b>Floyd</b> |    "Your daughter has already been providing me with a tonic, but I

<b>Floyd</b> | Part Two: Lost in Transformation
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    I miss Tevona. I miss her smile, her gentle touch. I miss being able
<b>Floyd</b> | to confide in her, to shine the light of her love on the dark corners
<b>Floyd</b> | of my heart. How often she helped me look up and see my own self worth.
<b>Floyd</b> | When I remember how much Tevona helped me I'm reminded of how she dealt
<b>Floyd</b> | with all of life's struggles so effortlessly. She inspired me to keep
<b>Floyd</b> | going. I learnt so much from her, and I miss her terribly.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Whether by the providence of God or my own good fortune I have had
<b>Floyd</b> | safety for the five days I've been running. Aside from an occasional,
<b>Floyd</b> | restless nap, drinking from whatever water source I stumbled across,
<b>Floyd</b> | and staying as far away from human and non-human contact as I could,
<b>Floyd</b> | nothing else has distracted me from my goal. In that time I've wondered
<b>Floyd</b> | long and deeply about just how Master Limos can help me. What can he
<b>Floyd</b> | do? Can he undo the curse? Will he help me to find Alsanter's murderer?
<b>Floyd</b> | I know so little about this wizard I don't know if I'll even be
<b>Floyd</b> | welcome.
<b>Floyd</b> |    The ground has been rising steadily for the last day as I made my
<b>Floyd</b> | way north, and this morning I entered the foothills of the Rylane
<b>Floyd</b> | Mountains, marked by a broad stretch of forest that adorns valley after
<b>Floyd</b> | valley. I passed a small outpost earlier, which I gave a wide berth,
<b>Floyd</b> | particularly when I heard a hunting horn being blown. The valley I have
<b>Floyd</b> | entered leads to the only village I know of in the mountains, Tallum,
<b>Floyd</b> | where I hope to gain information that will lead me to this wizard. The
<b>Floyd</b> | wind is bitter and cold, and I expect to find snow the higher up the
<b>Floyd</b> | mountains I go, but at the moment the ground is thankfully clear.
<b>Floyd</b> |    But right here and now, things have changed. In my mind I feel like
<b>Floyd</b> | I've been pushing against something intangible for each moment of the
<b>Floyd</b> | five days of my journey, like some spiritual shroud that threatens to
<b>Floyd</b> | envelop me. But now something feels wrong, out of place. My thoughts
<b>Floyd</b> | run like wild horses, uncontrollable...

<b>Floyd</b> | while the rest of the open space is covered with grass that waves in

<b>Floyd</b> |    A short distance ahead you can see the village of Tallum. Closest to
<b>Floyd</b> | you is what looks like the village square, a large paved area that is
<b>Floyd</b> | probably used for village celebrations and gatherings but is now almost
<b>Floyd</b> | deserted.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Almost. There are four men in the centre of the square. One man is
<b>Floyd</b> | hovering about five feet above the ground, whimpering as his legs and
<b>Floyd</b> | arms flail wildly, his face and arms marked by bruises and cuts, his
<b>Floyd</b> | greying beard and hair unkempt. The incongruity of a man suspended in
<b>Floyd</b> | the air without apparent support distracts you momentarily and you fail
<b>Floyd</b> | to examine the other men closely.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Two of the men are like apparitions from the past. Every story
<b>Floyd</b> | you've heard about the war with Gord ten years ago includes horrific
<b>Floyd</b> | tales of the destructive force that were the Ralyon warriors. Their
<b>Floyd</b> | magically enhanced endurance and strength, evidenced by the
<b>Floyd</b> | overdeveloped muscles in their upper body, were the cause of nightmares
<b>Floyd</b> | for the King of Rylane during the war. They were supposed to have been
<b>Floyd</b> | destroyed, with no chance they could ever come back.
<b>Floyd</b> |    And then you notice the other man standing there. A man dressed
<b>Floyd</b> | completely in black, with an amulet of blue around his neck.
<b>Floyd</b> |    The mysterious phantom you saw in Ryla.
<b>Floyd</b> |    The man appears to be really present this time, with nothing
<b>Floyd</b> | wraith-like about his appearance. He is facing the hovering man with
<b>Floyd</b> | one arm upraised almost as if to help him down.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Why do my men continue to die on the mountain?" the black-robed man
<b>Floyd</b> | demands, his voice carrying to you quite clearly. "You tell me there's
<b>Floyd</b> | nothing to fear, but my men continue to die. Why?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "I'm sorry, my lord," the hovering man replies, his voice breaking.
<b>Floyd</b> | "We didn't know..."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Didn't know?! How could you not know? You're the mayor of this
<b>Floyd</b> | pathetic little village, aren't you? You live so close you must have
<b>Floyd</b> | contact with him. Don't your people go up there from time to time?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "My lord, we don't go up the mountain. He doesn't visit us here.
<b>Floyd</b> | Please my lord, I'm speaking the truth..."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Maybe I'll just send your children up the mountains instead. You
<b>Floyd</b> | have a daughter, don't you?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    The mayor, who had been struggling against his predicament, freezes
<b>Floyd</b> | and his face turns white.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "No!" he gasps. "Please, she's only five. I'll do anything you
<b>Floyd</b> | want..."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Look, I'm tired of your grovelling. You obviously can't help me,
<b>Floyd</b> | and I'm too busy to waste more time on you. I'll come back later and
<b>Floyd</b> | find someone who can."
<b>Floyd</b> |    And with that, the black robed man waves his hand and the hapless
<b>Floyd</b> | man suddenly flies upwards at an incredible rate, screaming the entire
<b>Floyd</b> | time. You hear the scream move in a southerly direction as the wind
<b>Floyd</b> | catches the man and carries him away, and eventually the sound fades
<b>Floyd</b> | away completely.
<b>Floyd</b> |    In front of you, the black robed man turns to the Ralyon guards, and
<b>Floyd</b> | speaks in a voice even you can't hear. The guards immediately turn and
<b>Floyd</b> | head west. When they have departed, the black robed man waves his hand
<b>Floyd</b> | again, and there is a bright flash of green light which blinds you
<b>Floyd</b> | momentarily. When your eyes clear, the black robed man has vanished.
<b>Floyd</b> |    You wait for a moment or two to make sure there is no further
<b>Floyd</b> | danger, then make your way to the village square.

<b>Floyd</b> | Village square
<b>Floyd</b> | A broad area of stone pavement marks the centre of the village of
<b>Floyd</b> | Tallum. At each corner of the square is a tall wooden pole, around the

<b>Floyd</b> |    A rough track to the northeast leads to what looks like some land
<b>Floyd</b> | devoted to farming, to the southeast you can see some animal stalls,
<b>Floyd</b> | and directly east is a large, barn-like structure. A cluster of houses
<b>Floyd</b> | that must make up the residential part of the town can be seen to the
<b>Floyd</b> | southwest, while a tall building, which resembles a mill, can also be
<b>Floyd</b> | seen to the north. A well-worn path leads west, up a small incline, to
<b>Floyd</b> | what seems to be an inn.
<b>Floyd</b> |    The village appears to be protected from the howling wind somewhat,
<b>Floyd</b> | with only a few light gusts reaching ground level.

<b>Floyd</b> |    Towards the rear of the barn is a loft, a platform that provides an

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Lying on its side nearby is an empty barrel.

<b>Floyd</b> | Made from oak and painted a dark brown colour, the mill is more of a

<b>Floyd</b> | flows in from the west via a series of small cascades, passes behind
<b>Floyd</b> | the mill, then continues its flow eastwards. A narrow channel allows
<b>Floyd</b> | water to flow into the mill itself. The mill has a single point of
<b>Floyd</b> | entry, a small wooden door, which has been smashed to splinters. A
<b>Floyd</b> | wheelbarrow is sitting to one side of the door. Several pieces of a
<b>Floyd</b> | broken barrel lie scattered around the remains of the door.
<b>Floyd</b> |    To the east, following the stream, you can see an open area of
<b>Floyd</b> | farmland, while to the south you can see the village square. To the
<b>Floyd</b> | southwest, up a short incline, is the village inn, but to the west the

<b>Floyd</b> |    You can hear a strong wind howling as it blows over the cliffs, but

<b>Floyd</b> | Village square

<b>Floyd</b> |    A rough track to the northeast leads to what looks like some land
<b>Floyd</b> | devoted to farming, to the southeast you can see some animal stalls,
<b>Floyd</b> | and directly east is a large, barn-like structure. A cluster of houses
<b>Floyd</b> | that must make up the residential part of the town can be seen to the

<b>Floyd</b> | seen to the north. A well-worn path leads west, up a small incline, to

<b>Floyd</b> |    This part of the village appears to be on a natural hillock, and so
<b>Floyd</b> | for directions other than north there is a slight descent involved. To
<b>Floyd</b> | the south past the stable is a cluster of houses that must make up the

<b>Floyd</b> |    There is another flash of light and peal of thunder, and suddenly

<b>Floyd</b> | Wizard's cottage
<b>Floyd</b> | A warm fire is glowing in the hearth, which is providing the cottage
<b>Floyd</b> | with light and giving it a cosy feel. It is not a large cottage by any
<b>Floyd</b> | standard, and made even smaller by the number of things that fill the
<b>Floyd</b> | room. On either side of the fireplace are two enormous bookshelves,
<b>Floyd</b> | loaded with books and scrolls. A low table in the centre of the room is
<b>Floyd</b> | likewise burdened with parchments, and a variety of small bowls and
<b>Floyd</b> | implements. There is a cupboard with a glass door in the far corner of
<b>Floyd</b> | the room which holds a number of pots and jars, the contents of which
<b>Floyd</b> | you can't determine. Next to this is a simple wooden bed, and a single
<b>Floyd</b> | door leads outside.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Master Limos is here, seated on a stool next to the table, and
<b>Floyd</b> | regarding you with keen eyes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    "So," Master Limos says, stretching his legs out in front of him
<b>Floyd</b> | while looking at you directly. "Who are you and why are you here?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    All you can do is stare back at him.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Hmm," the wizard continues. "I think what we need here is a little
<b>Floyd</b> | vocal stimulation."
<b>Floyd</b> |    He raises a hand above his head, mumbles something in a strange
<b>Floyd</b> | tongue, and suddenly you are struck to the ground by an invisible hand.
<b>Floyd</b> | You feel your throat tighten, almost as if someone is strangling you,
<b>Floyd</b> | then it releases and the pain subsides.
<b>Floyd</b> |    You stagger to your feet again, groaning.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Groaning?
<b>Floyd</b> |    "How's that?" the wizard asks.
<b>Floyd</b> |    You clear your throat, and say, "Err..." -- I can talk! -- "...I
<b>Floyd</b> | feel quite strange..."
<b>Floyd</b> |    Limos nods. "That's to be expected. Well, given that you are
<b>Floyd</b> | actually talking, that means you aren't really a fox. If you had been a
<b>Floyd</b> | fox nothing would have happened."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Thank you for helping me..." you begin, your voice sounding strange
<b>Floyd</b> | in your ears, but Limos interrupts.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "I think I'm entitled to start this off. Back to my first question:
<b>Floyd</b> | who are you are why are you here?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    You fill Limos in briefly on your plight, how you were wrongly
<b>Floyd</b> | convicted of the murder of Prince Alsanter, and how King Rithusar, your
<b>Floyd</b> | foster father, saved you from execution by having the wizard Rixomas
<b>Floyd</b> | curse you, turning you into a fox. You also relate Rixomas' instruction
<b>Floyd</b> | to you, that you should head for a wizard in the Rylane mountains,
<b>Floyd</b> | called Master Limos.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "I see," the wizard says. "Did Rixomas give you any idea about what
<b>Floyd</b> | I might be able to do for you?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Err, no not really," you reply. "However, you have already helped
<b>Floyd</b> | me immensely by giving me the ability to communicate."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "I'll have to think about how else I can help you," Limos says. "In
<b>Floyd</b> | the meantime, I suppose you have some questions yourself. Now that you
<b>Floyd</b> | have a voice, you could probably ask them."

<b>Floyd</b> |    You look confused, as much as the face of a fox can convey

<b>Floyd</b> |    "The king's son is murdered, Rixomas has fallen gravely ill, and a

<b>Floyd</b> | throne, but maybe brute force is not what he has in mind."
<b>Floyd</b> |    You consider this for a moment. "If that's the case, if Vetan is

<b>Floyd</b> | Interlude: Lair
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    I don't like wizards. There. I've said it. Now all the world can
<b>Floyd</b> | know that I, Lord Sulanar of Alallsia, am a wizard-hater. My dislike
<b>Floyd</b> | for members of the magical profession is less to do with the people
<b>Floyd</b> | themselves, and more to do with their propensity to think too much of
<b>Floyd</b> | themselves. Power, in my experience, tends to corrupt, and wizards
<b>Floyd</b> | appear to be more susceptible than others.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Which was why I couldn't abide these reports of magical activity
<b>Floyd</b> | occurring in my province. It's all very well for Rithusar to keep his
<b>Floyd</b> | pet wizard on a leash - I don't need mystical powers to maintain
<b>Floyd</b> | control on my lands. Besides, magic makes my hands twitch. Initially
<b>Floyd</b> | the reports had been benign; a few of the lords of Alallsia had
<b>Floyd</b> | reported being met by a stranger with magical powers who offered power
<b>Floyd</b> | and wealth in return for their support in a revolt against King
<b>Floyd</b> | Rithusar. I would have ignored these reports, at least until the wizard
<b>Floyd</b> | deigned to contact me. But then Lord Alsohn vanished, quite literally,
<b>Floyd</b> | in front of witnesses. I can't say I was particularly upset, as his
<b>Floyd</b> | vocal support for the throne and active pacifism was a constant
<b>Floyd</b> | irritant to me. However, as he is one of my supporters as well I
<b>Floyd</b> | couldn't just ignore his disappearance, and so I sent a trusted agent
<b>Floyd</b> | to investigate.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Two days later, my agent turned up in the main harbour, sawn in two.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Which is why I'm now in this run-down warehouse on the outskirts of
<b>Floyd</b> | the city with a flaming torch in my hands and my sword at my side. My
<b>Floyd</b> | agent's last report included information that had led him here.
<b>Floyd</b> | Sometime after coming here he had met his fate.
<b>Floyd</b> |    I need to know why he died. I need to find my missing lord. I need
<b>Floyd</b> | to find this mysterious wizard.
<b>Floyd</b> |    And rid the world of him.

<b>Floyd</b> | Warehouse
<b>Floyd</b> | The light from the torch doesn't completely illuminate the area, but
<b>Floyd</b> | what you can see is not inspiring. The warehouse has been abandoned for
<b>Floyd</b> | a long time, and all that remains are the outer shell, which is in
<b>Floyd</b> | danger of falling down at any moment, and piles of rotting garbage,
<b>Floyd</b> | which lends an unpleasant aroma to the area. Overhead, the roof is
<b>Floyd</b> | disintegrating; large stretches of night sky can be seen through it.
<b>Floyd</b> | There is an exit to the north which leads back to the street.

<b>Floyd</b> | the lock and then the door suddenly swings open.
<b>Floyd</b> |    A man walks in. He is dressed entirely in black, although you notice
<b>Floyd</b> | a strange, blue amulet hanging around his neck, which is striking
<b>Floyd</b> | against the dark clothes. The man is younger than you expected. You
<b>Floyd</b> | estimate he could be no more than twenty-five years old, but the look
<b>Floyd</b> | in his eyes is ancient; cold and hard like stone, but weathered through
<b>Floyd</b> | untold experiences. You suppress a shiver and give the man your most
<b>Floyd</b> | imperious gaze.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Nice to meet you at last, Lord Sulanar," the man says without any
<b>Floyd</b> | hint of surprise, his voice smooth and clear. He has brought a candle
<b>Floyd</b> | with him which he sets on the small table between the two chairs,
<b>Floyd</b> | before turning back to face you.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "A pleasure," you say coldly. "Although I don't recall having been

<b>Floyd</b> |    The man gives you a surprisingly warm smile. "My deepest apologies.
<b>Floyd</b> | My name is Vetan. I assume you must be looking for something." He
<b>Floyd</b> | indicates the items in your hand. "Did you find it?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Mostly," you reply evenly. "I came looking for Lord Alsohn, who I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | devastated to report I found in your cabinet, rather dead."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Ah, yes, poor Lord Alsohn," Vetan says sadly. "I'm afraid he didn't
<b>Floyd</b> | appreciate some of my questions. He took them quite personally, and for
<b>Floyd</b> | some reason he jumped to a variety of unwarranted conclusions about
<b>Floyd</b> | what I offered him." Vetan's voice conveys a certain amount of regret,
<b>Floyd</b> | but his eyes are unmoved. "He tried to attack me, and I was forced to
<b>Floyd</b> | kill him in self-defence."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Indeed," you say. "What was it that could have caused Lord Alsohn
<b>Floyd</b> | to overcome his well-renowned hatred of violence to attempt harm on
<b>Floyd</b> | your person?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    The smallest smile curls the ends of Vetan's mouth. "Actually, I
<b>Floyd</b> | could run you through the things I talked with Lord Alsohn about, if
<b>Floyd</b> | you'd like," Vetan says. He moves around to stand in front of one of
<b>Floyd</b> | the chairs. "Why don't we sit down and have a chat?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    I know he is lying, but right now that's probably the least of my
<b>Floyd</b> | concerns. While I don't want to stay, I sense that his pleasantly

<b>Floyd</b> | Part Three: The Plan for Salvation
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    It's been said that when disaster looms, God will provide. While I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | still struggling with the concept of God, I can't help but see some
<b>Floyd</b> | order in all that's happened to me. What I originally thought was just
<b>Floyd</b> | about me and the tragedy I was enduring has turned into something much
<b>Floyd</b> | bigger, with more than my own life at stake. Does this mean there is a
<b>Floyd</b> | God, and he has a plan that I'm part of? Does this give meaning to my
<b>Floyd</b> | suffering? I have no answer.
<b>Floyd</b> |    No answer was what Master Limos gave me when I asked about where I
<b>Floyd</b> | would land in Ryla as a result of his wizardry. "Somewhere in the
<b>Floyd</b> | castle," was all he could tell me. Then he was gone, my final word of
<b>Floyd</b> | thanks unspoken on my now working lips, as he raised his arms and sent
<b>Floyd</b> | me on my magical journey. Colours and lights swirl around me now,
<b>Floyd</b> | almost blinding me in intensity, my destination only moments away.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Somewhere in the castle is the answer, the stitch that joins all the
<b>Floyd</b> | threads together. I know that the king hasn't touched Alsanter's room
<b>Floyd</b> | since the murder, so there is a chance I can learn something that was
<b>Floyd</b> | previously overlooked. I have a chance to save the king, his daughter
<b>Floyd</b> | and Rixomas, to prove to the king my worthiness to be his ward, and
<b>Floyd</b> | maybe prove to Tevona my own love for her.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    The spectral display of light vanishes, and you find yourself
<b>Floyd</b> | standing on your feet.

<b>Floyd</b> | Lord Sulanar's rooms

<b>Floyd</b> |    The door back to the corridor stands open to the north.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Lord Vonisor is standing nearby, with a determination in his stance

<b>Floyd</b> | Your eyes are assaulted by the sheer amount of stuff Lady Edukam has
<b>Floyd</b> | managed to cram into her rooms. The bed is the only article of
<b>Floyd</b> | furniture that is easily accessible, the canopy hanging down in
<b>Floyd</b> | elegant, lavender streams. Curtains mark out the position of the window
<b>Floyd</b> | in the southern wall, but the rest of the wall is taken up with a large
<b>Floyd</b> | wardrobe and chest of drawers. On top of the drawers are a number of
<b>Floyd</b> | small ornaments. A dresser sits against the northern wall beside the
<b>Floyd</b> | door, and is covered with bottles of perfume, the mirror in the dresser
<b>Floyd</b> | reflecting the candle held by Lord Vonisor. Two chairs near the
<b>Floyd</b> | fireplace rest on a peach-coloured rug, and over the back of one of the
<b>Floyd</b> | chairs a dress of deepest violet has been draped.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Amid all the furniture, restricting movement in the room, are
<b>Floyd</b> | various boxes, piles of books and papers, and one or two mounds of
<b>Floyd</b> | clothes.
<b>Floyd</b> |    The door back to the corridor stands open to the north.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Lord Vonisor is standing nearby, with a determination in his stance
<b>Floyd</b> | as if he is ready to attack the first enemy to come into view.

<b>Floyd</b> | Prince Alsanter's rooms

<b>Floyd</b> | in the centre of the room, on top of which is a cup. To the left, in

<b>Floyd</b> |     A passage leads westwards, while the door back to the corridor

<b>Floyd</b> | Epilogue
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    As I stand at the bottom of the stairs that lead up to the
<b>Floyd</b> | battlements, I am both dreading and desiring this meeting. It's been
<b>Floyd</b> | almost a week since I had Tevona arrested for her brother's murder, and
<b>Floyd</b> | since Rixomas lifted the curse on Torrin, returning him to human form.
<b>Floyd</b> | In the intervening time I've hardly had a moment to myself, as dozens
<b>Floyd</b> | of reports of Ralyon warrior incidents seemed to arrive all at once.
<b>Floyd</b> | Murders in Lamiek, civil unrest in Grithim, almost a revolt in Drekas.
<b>Floyd</b> | We still don't know where these creatures are staging from, which means
<b>Floyd</b> | there could be months of these scattered incidents and fruitless
<b>Floyd</b> | searching ahead. On top of all this, I also have concerns about the
<b>Floyd</b> | whereabouts of Lord Sulanar, as his own people have not seen or heard
<b>Floyd</b> | from him in some time.
<b>Floyd</b> |    But for now I can breathe, and I knew I had to seek out Torrin.
<b>Floyd</b> |    I am king, but at the moment I feel like a fool and a failure. I am
<b>Floyd</b> | carrying a weight of grief and sadness I didn't know could be borne. My
<b>Floyd</b> | emotions threaten to overwhelm me, and I don't know if I can stop them.
<b>Floyd</b> | And in a few days I will be presiding over the trial of my daughter, a
<b>Floyd</b> | formality that will have to result in... I can't even say it. However
<b>Floyd</b> | much I love my daughter, I can't arrange for her escape. I can't do
<b>Floyd</b> | what I did for Torrin again. It won't be allowed by anyone.
<b>Floyd</b> |    There is so much pain and despair, so much hopelessness to be
<b>Floyd</b> | overcome in my own life. I need to walk up these stairs and talk with
<b>Floyd</b> | Torrin. I need to find hope, to communicate hope to him, to reach out
<b>Floyd</b> | to him in some way. I don't know if I can, or if he is willing.
<b>Floyd</b> |    But I have to try.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Bottom of the stairs
<b>Floyd</b> | A narrow passage bends around from east to south, the low stone ceiling
<b>Floyd</b> | making this access corridor feel closed in and oppressive. There are
<b>Floyd</b> | one or two torches mounted on the walls providing light to the
<b>Floyd</b> | otherwise dark passage. A narrow, winding stairway leads upwards.

<b>Floyd</b> | through the doorway at the top.
<b>Floyd</b> |    It is cold with the coming winter, but a magnificent sunset is
<b>Floyd</b> | glowing in the western sky, turning the scattered clouds bronze and
<b>Floyd</b> | gold. From the western horizon the rose sky fades to indigo in the east
<b>Floyd</b> | in a beautiful gradient of colour that spans almost every hue.
<b>Floyd</b> | Sunlight, like shards of crystal, break out between the clouds and

<b>Floyd</b> | Battlements
<b>Floyd</b> | The stone battlements around you are familiar; you have walked these
<b>Floyd</b> | paths every day in your role as king, and know almost every stone that
<b>Floyd</b> | forms the parapets and crenels along the wall, or the marks in the
<b>Floyd</b> | stones that form the walkway. Here at the northern end there is a door
<b>Floyd</b> | that leads back down to the access corridor, while the battlements
<b>Floyd</b> | continue to the south. The castle courtyard is visible below, lit with
<b>Floyd</b> | the fading light of the sun.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Standing next to a nearby parapet is Torrin, son of Bradda.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    As you walk through the door that leads onto the walkway you see
<b>Floyd</b> | Tholin the priest disappearing through the door at the opposite end,
<b>Floyd</b> | leaning heavily on his walking stick as he does so.   Torrin bows, then
<b>Floyd</b> | looks at you expectantly.

<b>Floyd</b> | God did exist, he'd abandoned me. But when I started to see the bigger
<b>Floyd</b> | picture, about Vetan and his plan to overthrow the kingdom, about how
<b>Floyd</b> | the curse that brought about my transformation gave me abilities I
<b>Floyd</b> | needed to uncover the truth about Alsanter's murder, I began to see
<b>Floyd</b> | there was a reason for things. There were too many co-incidences for it
<b>Floyd</b> | to be just a lucky series of events. And if there really is a reason
<b>Floyd</b> | for things, if things happened the way they did because of a plan, then
<b>Floyd</b> | ultimately that means there was someone responsible for that plan."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "God," you put in.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Torrin nods. "So I asked Tholin about it. I wanted to know if this
<b>Floyd</b> | experience proves that God exists. Does this example of providence mean
<b>Floyd</b> | that there is now conclusive proof of God?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "And what did Tholin say?" you ask.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Actually, he said 'No'. He said that all it could do is give me
