The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below are transcripts of several old (and generally wacky) classic games.  You can find out more about each game, including how to download it, by clicking on its title in these paragraphs.  The first is <I><A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/504">Coke Is It!</A></I> by Soda&nbsp;Pop&nbsp;Productions (J.&nbsp;Robinson&nbsp;Wheeler, Michael&nbsp;Fessler, Adam&nbsp;Cadre, Dan&nbsp;Shiovitz, and David&nbsp;Dyte), an experiment in what would happen if corporations began paying IF authors for product placement.</br></br>

We then chased the Coke with a few Speed IFs: <I><A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/1201">You Are a Chef!</A></I> by Dan&nbsp;Shiovitz, <I><A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/1719">A Day for Fresh Sushi</A></I> by Emily&nbsp;Short, <I><A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/523">Kids, don't eat your Halloween candy without having your parents inspect it first because there are SICKOS out there who will put RAZOR BLADES in it and you will CUT YOUR MOUTH and GET A POISONED INFECTION and DIE, all from eating your candy early.  So don't do that)</A></I> (my personal favorite for best IF title ever) by Dan&nbsp;Shiovitz, and <I><A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/2212">Tower of Beef</A></I> by Ricardo&nbsp;Signes.

</br></br>If you'd like to skip to a particular game in the transcript, you can click on the individual title:</br><center><a href="#cokeisit"><U>Coke&nbsp;Is&nbsp;It!</U></A></br>by Soda&nbsp;Pop&nbsp;Productions</br></br><a href="#youareachef"><U>You&nbsp;Are&nbsp;a&nbsp;Chef!</U></A></br>by Dan&nbsp;Shiovitz</br></br><a href="#dayforfreshsushi"><U>A&nbsp;Day&nbsp;for&nbsp;Fresh&nbsp;Sushi</U></A></br>by Emily&nbsp;Short</br></br><a href="#kidsdont"><U>Kids&nbsp;Don't...</U></A></br>by Dan&nbsp;Shiovitz</br></br><a href="#towerofbeef"><U>Tower&nbsp;of&nbsp;Beef</U></A></br>by Ricardo&nbsp;Signes</center></center>

<b>Floyd</b> |  INTERACTIVE FICTION: IT'S BACK
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  For too long since its heyday in the 80's, interactive fiction has
<b>Floyd</b> | languished in the ghetto of obscurity. Despite brilliant and
<b>Floyd</b> | insightful works by dozens of new authors, IF has continually failed
<b>Floyd</b> | to receive the recognition by the general community it so richly

<b>Floyd</b> | deserves. The solution? Corporate sponsorship.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  The Coca-Cola Corporation, in conjunction with the newly-formed
<b>Floyd</b> | Interactive Fiction Promotion Board (a wholly-owned subsidary of the
<b>Floyd</b> | Cola-Cola Corporation), is pleased to announce a new direction in text
<b>Floyd</b> | adventures, Interactive Fiction for the Next Millennium.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ----------------------------------------------------------------------
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Our promotion plans will take several forms. Television and radio
<b>Floyd</b> | advertising, of course, will be a must. The marketing department is

<b>Floyd</b> | still working out slogans, but we have a number that seem promising,
<b>Floyd</b> | including "Zork: it's the choice of a new generation", "Just say 'No'
<b>Floyd</b> | to grues", and "Perdition's Flames: Mostly Dead".
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  The opportunity for product tie-ins are also unlimited. Imagine being
<b>Floyd</b> | able to purchase an Elvish bottle-opener of great antiquity (glows

<b>Floyd</b> | blue in the presence of caffeine!), or a black rod with a rusty star
<b>Floyd</b> | on one end and the familiar red-and-white logo on the other. Or how
<b>Floyd</b> | about this: buy a six-pack of Coke, and get a hintbook for Curses!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  And speaking of Curses, that brings us to the most important aspect
<b>Floyd</b> | of the promotion -- IF development. Because that's what this is really

<b>Floyd</b> | all about, right? With the help of the Coca-Cola Interactive Fiction
<b>Floyd</b> | Promotion Board Foundation, full-time IF authorship is about to become
<b>Floyd</b> | a reality. Certain selected authors will be chosen based on the
<b>Floyd</b> | quality of their work to receive sponsored positions at the
<b>Floyd</b> | Foundation, with no other task than to continue producing the sort of
<b>Floyd</b> | games they've become famous for. Needless to say, these are expected

<b>Floyd</b> | to be highly-sought positions, but all members of the IF community are
<b>Floyd</b> | encouraged to apply. As examples of the sort of thing we'll be looking
<b>Floyd</b> | for, the Foundation has hired several current IF authors to rework
<b>Floyd</b> | parts of existing games in the new "Coca-Cola style".
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  We hope you enjoy the package, and invite you to submit a demo game

<b>Floyd</b> | of your own ASAP!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  P.S. And remember -- when you see XYZZY, think Coke!

<b>Floyd</b> | After seeing the wonderful promotional game 'The Lost Island of
<b>Floyd</b> | Alanna' on the Cherry Coke web site

<b>Floyd</b> | (<A HREF="http://www.cherrycoke.com/alanna/">http://www.cherrycoke.com/alanna/</A>), a group of us decided to contact
<b>Floyd</b> | Coca-Cola and see if they would be interested in doing a similar thing
<b>Floyd</b> | with IF. We had the good luck of being able to contact Mr. Fizzlewick,
<b>Floyd</b> | who surprised us all with the fervor of his interest in our idea.
<b>Floyd</b> | Soon, we were all hired and working frantically to produce

<b>Floyd</b> | 'proof-of-concept' scenarios based on current works of IF. We managed
<b>Floyd</b> | to put this game together in time for their end-of-March manager's
<b>Floyd</b> | meeting, where JP was able to sell the idea to the group. If all goes
<b>Floyd</b> | well, you should see this game or something very similar go up on one
<b>Floyd</b> | of their web pages some time in April. In the meantime, JP wanted us
<b>Floyd</b> | to tell the rest of the IF community about the idea, so we put

<b>Floyd</b> | together this package and are uploading it to GMD.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The following people comprise the group:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lucian Smith:  The main module and library replacement.
<b>Floyd</b> | Adam Thornton:  'Curses' module

<b>Floyd</b> | J. Robinson Wheeler:  'Adventure' module
<b>Floyd</b> | Michael Fessler:  'Planetfall' module
<b>Floyd</b> | Adam Cadre:  'Hitchhiker's Guide' module
<b>Floyd</b> | Dan Shiovitz:  'Losing Your Grip' module
<b>Floyd</b> | David Dyte:  'A Bear's Night Out' module

<b>Floyd</b> | Mr. McBeefy's Beef Imporium
<b>Floyd</b> | The Beef Imporium -- MBI, to you wage slaves -- stands at the very
<b>Floyd</b> | base of the Tower of Beef.  The vast glass ceiling lets you look up
<b>Floyd</b> | into the Tower and see the vast machinery of Mr. McBeefy's Vertical

<b>Floyd</b> | Beef Processing Facility at work.  Cows and carcasses swing by at all
<b>Floyd</b> | elevations, ready to be processed from happy heifers into happy meals.
<b>Floyd</b> | Now and then an organ or spurt of blood falls onto the glass ceiling,
<b>Floyd</b> | but it's always quickly cleaned up by one of the janitors.  Those
<b>Floyd</b> | lucky bastards get off with the easy work.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The supply room lies to the east, and a sliding door leads out.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Like most days, the place is full of kids.  There are two field-trips
<b>Floyd</b> | here, at the moment.

<b>Floyd</b> | Mr. McBeefy's Beef Imporium

<b>Floyd</b> | The Beef Imporium -- MBI, to you wage slaves -- stands at the very
<b>Floyd</b> | base of the Tower of Beef.  The vast glass ceiling lets you look up
<b>Floyd</b> | into the Tower and see the vast machinery of Mr. McBeefy's Vertical
<b>Floyd</b> | Beef Processing Facility at work.  Cows and carcasses swing by at all
<b>Floyd</b> | elevations, ready to be processed from happy heifers into happy meals.
<b>Floyd</b> | Now and then an organ or spurt of blood falls onto the glass ceiling,

<b>Floyd</b> | but it's always quickly cleaned up by one of the janitors.  Those
<b>Floyd</b> | lucky bastards get off with the easy work.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The supply room lies to the east, and a sliding door leads out.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Like most days, the place is full of kids.  There are two field-trips

<b>Floyd</b> | here, at the moment.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | You step out into the warm, sunshiny day.  Here and there, co-workers
<b>Floyd</b> | sit and eat packed lunches, discussing their days. Children frolic and
<b>Floyd</b> | birds sing.  What a perfect day!

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You lean back against The Tower and contemplate your success,
<b>Floyd</b> | imagining the future of the world:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Fifty or seventy-five years from now, billions are dead from the
<b>Floyd</b> | mutated Beef Flu.  Death from Super McBeefy is slow, throbbing, and

<b>Floyd</b> | painful -- as you well know -- and society has fallen apart trying
<b>Floyd</b> | merely to bury the dead and sustain the living.  With the economy in
<b>Floyd</b> | shambles and the majority of the fabric of society in tatters, the
<b>Floyd</b> | human race is reduced to foraging: foraging for nuts and berries, and
<b>Floyd</b> | not beef.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You are a hero!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |     *** You have won ***
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | In that game you scored 35 out of a possible 35, in 25 turns.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?
