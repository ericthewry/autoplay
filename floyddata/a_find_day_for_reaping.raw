The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>A Fine Day for Reaping</i>, written by James Webb.  <I>A Fine Day for Reaping</I> was originally released as part of the 2007 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took seventh place. It took first place in the InsideADRIFT Game of the Year Comp 2007, was nominated for a Best Individual PC Xyzzy Award, and won the Xyzzy for Best Story.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/A_Fine_Day_for_Reaping'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | It's a fairly easy life being the Grim Reaper.  People often make the
<b>Floyd</b> | mistake of assuming that you appear at every death.  Of course, that's
<b>Floyd</b> | a mistake that they only tend to make once.  The reality is quite
<b>Floyd</b> | different.  Death tends to happen to people whether you are there or
<b>Floyd</b> | not, you actually only show up for the more unusual cases.  Every now
<b>Floyd</b> | or then someone will put up a fight and not take death lying down.
<b>Floyd</b> | That's when you show up to make sure that they play by the rules.
<b>Floyd</b> | Essentially, you're a high stakes baliff.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Every day your Supervisors mail you a list of the difficult cases.
<b>Floyd</b> | You have twelve hours to make sure that souls are reaped and the wages
<b>Floyd</b> | of sin are paid.  Welcome to a day in the life of Death.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Useful Commands
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | examine hourglass
<b>Floyd</b> | This will tell you how long you have left before the day ends.  You
<b>Floyd</b> | don't want to know what happens if you don't finish reaping the
<b>Floyd</b> | alloted souls within the time limit.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | say X to Horse
<b>Floyd</b> | Where 'X' equals your destination.  You own a skeletal horse, named
<b>Floyd</b> | Horse (you are not known for your imagination).  Tell him/her where
<b>Floyd</b> | you want to go and he/she (it's difficult to sex skeletal horses) will
<b>Floyd</b> | take you there.  To return to your home then use the simple command
<b>Floyd</b> | say home to horse

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | David Whyld, de budding and Ren for beta testing my first game, The

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | All the people who played, reviewed and voted for The Sisters during
<b>Floyd</b> | the 12th Annual IF Competition.  The whole experience encouraged me to
<b>Floyd</b> | keep writing.  So this game is mostly your fault.

<b>Floyd</b> | only living (using the term loosely) soul in this dimension and yet

<b>Floyd</b> | the other letter, which comes in the unmarked, large brown envelope
<b>Floyd</b> | that your Supervisors use when they want to contact you.  It looks
<b>Floyd</b> | like you've got some work to do today.  You open it and begin to read.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You have five clients today.  Four standard cases and one
<b>Floyd</b> | administrative error...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You roll your eyes.  Administrative errors are the worst.  It means
<b>Floyd</b> | that the paperwork has got screwed up somewhere along the line and
<b>Floyd</b> | some poor idiot is not where they should be when they're fated to die.
<b>Floyd</b> | As usual, it's up to you to clear up somebody else's mess. You carry
<b>Floyd</b> | on reading, though you know the words off by heart now.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Please find attached the details of the clients.  These clients will
<b>Floyd</b> | die, as fated, but for some reason will refuse or be unable to
<b>Floyd</b> | progress to their destination.  Reap their souls to complete the
<b>Floyd</b> | cycle.  You must complete this task by the end of the day.  Thank you.

<b>Floyd</b> | again, his doctor had warned him against mountain climbing too.  But
<b>Floyd</b> | he wouldn't trade this for anything.  The view was splendid and
<b>Floyd</b> | stretched for miles, and it almost made him shake off the nagging
<b>Floyd</b> | feeling that he really should have been at that surprise party.  Sure,
<b>Floyd</b> | the family would be disappointed when he didn't show up, but they
<b>Floyd</b> | should have made a better effort to make sure that he wouldn't find
<b>Floyd</b> | out.  He wasn't stupid.  Leaving the guest list out where he could
<b>Floyd</b> | find it wasn't too clever for a start.  But that didn't really explain
<b>Floyd</b> | the feeling.  It wasn't guilt but rather something else.  Something he
<b>Floyd</b> | couldn't quite put his finger on.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He pushed the feeling back again and looked into the sunshine, lifting
<b>Floyd</b> | his hands above his head.  He felt so alive!  He almost let out a cry
<b>Floyd</b> | of triumph, but stopped just in time.  There's no telling what might
<b>Floyd</b> | cause an avalanche in this part of the world.  Just then he heard a
<b>Floyd</b> | rush of wind behind him, he turned and...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ...found himself staring at a skeletal horse, ridden by a tall,
<b>Floyd</b> | ghastly apparition of horror, who seemed to be reading a list...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lord Nigel McWorthington screamed at the top of his voice and gripped
<b>Floyd</b> | his chest.  The scream rebounded off the mountain walls and was
<b>Floyd</b> | suddenly silenced by an ominous rumbling sound from above.  He looked
<b>Floyd</b> | up at the avalanche descending rapidly, turned once again to the
<b>Floyd</b> | horrifying apparition and managed the words "You complete and
<b>Floyd</b> | utter..." before he was buried under a crushing weight of snow.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You shrug and climb off Horse.  This was clearly Nigel McWorthington,
<b>Floyd</b> | and you suspect that he is (you mean was) the administrative error.
<b>Floyd</b> | Seems that death caught up with him after all.  You smile at the
<b>Floyd</b> | double entendre and turn your attention to the scene.  To reap his
<b>Floyd</b> | soul you have to get to the body, which is currently under thirty foot
<b>Floyd</b> | of snow.  You scratch your head in puzzlement.  Why are these things
<b>Floyd</b> | never easy?

<b>Floyd</b> | Himilayan mountain range.  The view is lovely, but it isn't half
<b>Floyd</b> | chilly here.  Your feet are getting cold and the wind is whipping
<b>Floyd</b> | right up your robe.  Right in front of you is a huge snowdrift, under

<b>Floyd</b> | Cellar (Manchester)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This is a dark and dank cellar underneath a house in Manchester.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | tough, red brick did a good job of containing the blast from the
<b>Floyd</b> | exploded time machine.  The remains of said time machine sit in the
<b>Floyd</b> | centre of the cellar, nothing more than a twisted pile of metal and
<b>Floyd</b> | wires.  In one corner of the room is a stairwell, in the other a
<b>Floyd</b> | workbench and varied selection of tools and objects that look
<b>Floyd</b> | suspiciously mechanical.

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | looking around the cellar thoughtfully.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "If this works we'll be famous!" chattered Ernest Busset, excitedly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "That's understating it slightly, Ernest." said Thomas Brewer,
<b>Floyd</b> | sardonically.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Just think of it, man!  Time travel!  We'll be...famous!" Ernest
<b>Floyd</b> | Busset could barely contain his excitement.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Are you sure this will work?  I'm not confident myself.  I know we've
<b>Floyd</b> | run through the figures a million times but...well, I've just got a
<b>Floyd</b> | bad feeling about this.  What if it doesn't work?" Thomas sounded
<b>Floyd</b> | very, very worried.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Nonsense!  This must work!  As you said yourself, we've gone through
<b>Floyd</b> | the figures a million times.  Now.  Stand back."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Ernest sat himself into the contraption.  It looked like the cockpit
<b>Floyd</b> | of a glider, surrounded by a mass of wires and bits and pieces of
<b>Floyd</b> | metal.  Ernest fiddled with the controls in front of him.  They looked
<b>Floyd</b> | like they had been cobbled together from bits and pieces of old games
<b>Floyd</b> | consoles.  A digital readout flashed excitedly in front of his eyes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yes, yes.  See, that's what I'm talking about.  If you're so
<b>Floyd</b> | confident it will work then why are you telling me to 'stand back'?"
<b>Floyd</b> | Thomas did, however, take several large steps backwards as he said
<b>Floyd</b> | this.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Just in case!  Who knows what will happen?  Who knows if the field
<b>Floyd</b> | will be purely contained to the machine?  I wouldn't want you getting
<b>Floyd</b> | sucked back through time with me!  You need to stay here and document
<b>Floyd</b> | our success from this end!" Ernest was idly flipping a switch back and
<b>Floyd</b> | forth.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "See, you're doing it again.  'Who knows what will happen?'  Is that
<b>Floyd</b> | supposed to inspire confidence?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Just relax, old boy.  Think about what you're going to do when we are
<b>Floyd</b> | no longer constrained by time!  What will you do with this power?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm going to go back in time and kill Hitler's parents." Thomas
<b>Floyd</b> | looked grim, his lips set in a firm line.  Ernest looked puzzled.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I wouldn't do that, old boy.  That sort of thing would just make
<b>Floyd</b> | Hitler really angry, wouldn't it?  I wouldn't have thought he was the
<b>Floyd</b> | sort of fellow you'd want to get on the bad side of."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "No.  You've misunderstood." 'Again' Thomas added mentally, "I would
<b>Floyd</b> | kill them before he was born."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "That doesn't make sense, man!  I mean, how can they be Hitler's
<b>Floyd</b> | parents until they have had a baby called Hitler?  Stands to reason!"
<b>Floyd</b> | said Ernest, cheerfully.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Never mind," Thomas muttered, "Look.  Be careful" he added, surprised
<b>Floyd</b> | at how much he meant it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "No problem!  Just watch this!" Ernest cheered, as he reached out and
<b>Floyd</b> | pushed a button.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There was a whirring noise, which increased in intensity until it
<b>Floyd</b> | ended abruptly in a rather large explosion.  Thomas Brewer was thrown
<b>Floyd</b> | back against the far wall, and crumpled to a heap on the floor. He
<b>Floyd</b> | looked up from his prone position to see a tattered, charred shoe fall
<b>Floyd</b> | in front of him.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh dear." he said, with rather considerable constraint.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He then climbed to his feet and turned to find you watching him from
<b>Floyd</b> | the other end of the room.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh dear oh dear." he trembles, "Look.  Just tell me.  Am I dead?"
<b>Floyd</b> | You gaze at the List.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ith your name Ernetht Buthet?" you intone.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thomas Brewer looks at you blankly.  It's hard enough for a man to be
<b>Floyd</b> | on the verge of humanity's greatest scientific breakthrough and then
<b>Floyd</b> | to suddenly be confronted with the possibility that he might be dead,
<b>Floyd</b> | let alone to find that the Gatekeeper of the Afterlife has a speech
<b>Floyd</b> | impediment.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm sorry, did you say 'Erneth Buffet'?  Ummm...Do you mean Ernest
<b>Floyd</b> | Busset?" Thomas brushed himself down.  You nod irritably.  You've had
<b>Floyd</b> | a lisp for as long as you can remember and it's not your fault.  It
<b>Floyd</b> | certainly doesn't make your job any easier.  "No.  No.  I'm Thomas
<b>Floyd</b> | Brewer.  Ernest Busset is...oh.  Oh no!  Oh no!  Ernest is dead?"
<b>Floyd</b> | Thomas exclaims, shocked.  You nod again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Where ith he then?" you ask, looking round the room in annoyance.
<b>Floyd</b> | Thomas grins and points at the charred heap of metal in the centre of
<b>Floyd</b> | the room.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I think the question really should be 'when is he?'  We built a time
<b>Floyd</b> | machine, he and I did.  And as there's no sign of a corpse I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | guessing that it worked!  It worked!  Do you realise what this means?"
<b>Floyd</b> | Thomas was jubilant, forgetting the situation for a moment.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You shrug.  You personally suspect that it means that they won't be
<b>Floyd</b> | selling anything other than one-way tickets but you say nothing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ha!  He might have survived!  You can't know for certain!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You sigh.  You've had to recover your clients from some very strange
<b>Floyd</b> | places in the past, but never a different time.  There has to be a way
<b>Floyd</b> | to solve this one.

<b>Floyd</b> | Private Kline yawned.  Guard duty was so unbelievably boring.  He knew
<b>Floyd</b> | that he wouldn't have normally pulled this duty for six days in a row
<b>Floyd</b> | but recent events with the General's daughter had resulted in this
<b>Floyd</b> | sorry state of affairs.  He didn't regret a thing, but...this was
<b>Floyd</b> | really boring.  Nothing ever happened.  He was guarding a single door
<b>Floyd</b> | in the most heavily protected military faculty in the United States.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He moved his rifle to the other shoulder and shrugged.  Maybe he
<b>Floyd</b> | should play The Game again.  His time on guard duty had been spent
<b>Floyd</b> | developing the rules to The Game.  It helped pass the time.  The Game
<b>Floyd</b> | involved him seeing how many times he could spin his rifle above his
<b>Floyd</b> | head in a minute.  It couldn't be any old spin, however, as the rules
<b>Floyd</b> | made quite clear.  The gun had to be held a certain distance above his
<b>Floyd</b> | head, at a certain angle.  The spin had to be at a certain velocity.
<b>Floyd</b> | It was pretty complicated, which probably explained why - after five
<b>Floyd</b> | days - his personal best was only two.  The rules were being reviewed
<b>Floyd</b> | yet again.  Maybe version 1.6 of The Game would see some major
<b>Floyd</b> | changes.  He didn't want a repeat of version 1.3, where he was very
<b>Floyd</b> | lucky not to have shot himself in the face.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | CRASH!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Private Kline stopped in mid-thought.  What was that?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | CRUNCH!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It sounded like it was coming from the storage cupboard just down the
<b>Floyd</b> | corridor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I jutht trod in paint or thomething!" a muffled (but raised) voice
<b>Floyd</b> | sounded.  It was definitely coming from the storage cupboard.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Honethtly!  You could land anywhere in the whole building and you
<b>Floyd</b> | chooth to land in a cupboard!  Thtupid animal!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Who's in there!" shouted Kline, his rifle raised.  The door opened
<b>Floyd</b> | and out stepped an incredibly tall and gaunt figure...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ..You turn and see the young soldier with his gun raised.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Excuth me, but thouldn't you be pointing the other end at me?" you
<b>Floyd</b> | offer, helpfully.  You have no need to be afraid of firearms.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Private Kline hurridly turns his rifle the right way round and looks
<b>Floyd</b> | at you, almost apologetically.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Identify yourself!" he barks.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Me?  I'm the Grim Reaper," you explain, checking The List, "And you
<b>Floyd</b> | wouldn't happen to be Thplong5b would you?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Huh?  What?" Private Kline tried to compose himself.  He'd wanted
<b>Floyd</b> | some excitement, but this was a lot more confusing than he'd thought
<b>Floyd</b> | it would be.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "No.  I gueth not.  You don't look like a Thplong5b.  I think I need
<b>Floyd</b> | to go through that door behind you." you look up from The List,
<b>Floyd</b> | certain that your Client is in the room that this soldier is guarding.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The door behind me?" Kline's resolve hardens, "No.  No I think not.
<b>Floyd</b> | I've got one job in this place - guard this door.  I don't care who
<b>Floyd</b> | you are.  You are not getting through."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You sigh, but then look into Kline's face and realise that you've
<b>Floyd</b> | never come across a man with such single-minded determination before.
<b>Floyd</b> | Neither have you ever met someone with such total confidence that
<b>Floyd</b> | whatever he happens to face he can solve it with his gun.  Your own
<b>Floyd</b> | conviction wavers.  Most people, when faced with the Grim Reaper,
<b>Floyd</b> | simply give up.  This is new territory for you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As a creature formed and given shape by belief you begin to wonder if
<b>Floyd</b> | Kline's faith in his gun is so great that it might actually cause you
<b>Floyd</b> | a problem were you to try and force your way past him.  You're not
<b>Floyd</b> | certain, but neither are you prepared to take the risk.  You didn't
<b>Floyd</b> | get this far by taking risks.  This really is very annoying, but
<b>Floyd</b> | you're going to have to find a way past Private Kline.

<b>Floyd</b> | You feel like a pen in a matchbox.  From the outside the machine
<b>Floyd</b> | looked complicated, but from the inside the task of understanding
<b>Floyd</b> | what's going on is positively herculean.  You can see a large number
<b>Floyd</b> | of lights and dials, none of which you can understand.  It doesn't
<b>Floyd</b> | help that any instructions written in the machine are in some kind of
<b>Floyd</b> | alien dialect.  The things that you think might be significant are a
<b>Floyd</b> | digital readout which says '2007', the buttons next to this readout,
<b>Floyd</b> | an open panel revealing a mix of wires and a pile of paper which is
<b>Floyd</b> | chained to the inside of the machine, clearly to avoid theft.

<b>Floyd</b> | Jimiyu Wangai sat at the table, a thoughtful look on his face.  He was
<b>Floyd</b> | dead.  He wasn't surprised by this - in fact he'd been fairly certain
<b>Floyd</b> | it was going to happen anytime soon.  He enjoyed being proved right.
<b>Floyd</b> | Well, he'd lived a long and full life but had no intention of giving
<b>Floyd</b> | it up quite yet.  His youngest granddaughter was getting married in
<b>Floyd</b> | two weeks and he had been looking forward to that for ages.  So he'd
<b>Floyd</b> | decided that he wasn't going to go, and had made arrangements
<b>Floyd</b> | accordingly.  It had been surprisingly easy to work out.  He'd found
<b>Floyd</b> | the answer in a book in a library in Nairobi.  He'd spent the past few
<b>Floyd</b> | weeks at this table, waiting.  Now he was nearly there.  He looked at
<b>Floyd</b> | the entrance to his hut...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ...and as if right on cue, you stride in.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Jimiyu Wangai?" you ask
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | 'No.  That's someone else?'"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You nod.  "They do.  It never workth."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I suppose not." Jimiyu laughs again.  You're torn between two
<b>Floyd</b> | emotions - gratitude that he has yet to point out that you have a
<b>Floyd</b> | lisp, and confusion.  Most people aren't really that happy to see you.
<b>Floyd</b> | You sigh.  Time to see what he's got up his sleeve.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Your time ith up, Jimiyu."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "What's the rush?  Haven't we time for a quick game first..." Jimiyu's
<b>Floyd</b> | grin is really beginning to get on your nerves.  He gestures at the
<b>Floyd</b> | table in front of him.  You notice, for the first time, that he is
<b>Floyd</b> | sitting in front of a chess set.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh...bother," you mutter.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's the rules.  If they challenge you, you have to play.  If they win
<b>Floyd</b> | then you've got to leave them alone.  If you win they have to come
<b>Floyd</b> | quietly.  It's the rules.  The universe likes rules.  The problem is
<b>Floyd</b> | that you're not actually much good at chess.  It's never really been a
<b>Floyd</b> | problem before.  Most people don't even think of it, let alone being
<b>Floyd</b> | foresighted enough to make sure that they die sitting at a chess set.
<b>Floyd</b> | You possess a little more foresight however, and have a contingency
<b>Floyd</b> | plan.  You committed to memory a failsafe way of winning a chess
<b>Floyd</b> | match, an unbeatable strategy, a foolproof way to victory.  With just

<b>Floyd</b> | dusty floor is going to leave its mark under your toenails for days.
<b>Floyd</b> | Jimiyu Wangai sits on a rickety wicker chair, facing a squat,
<b>Floyd</b> | uncomfortable-looking stool.  Between the two seats is a frail table,
<b>Floyd</b> | on which sits a chess board.

<b>Floyd</b> | In 2004 archaeologists found a strange set of human footprints outside
<b>Floyd</b> | a cave in Follina, northern Italy.  The footprints date back about

<b>Floyd</b> | Agathe Laurent lay on the bed, smiling to herself.  Death hadn't been
<b>Floyd</b> | as unpleasant as she'd feared, but she would still rather cling on to
<b>Floyd</b> | life.  She knew where she was with life.  If there was one thing that
<b>Floyd</b> | Agathe had always been afraid of it was the unknown.  Well, perhaps
<b>Floyd</b> | afraid was too strong a word.  Agathe was loathe to admit that
<b>Floyd</b> | anything frightened her, but she was sufficiently troubled to be moved
<b>Floyd</b> | to action.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It had cost her a lot to get to this stage, but she thought it would
<b>Floyd</b> | all be worth it if it worked.  She'd have done something that - as far
<b>Floyd</b> | as she knew - no-one had ever done before.  She'd have cheated death.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Standing in the doorway was an impossibly tall and lanky figure,
<b>Floyd</b> | wreathed in black and as pale as boiled rice.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Come in," said Agathe...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ..you enter the hotel room, bending to get through the door as you go.
<b>Floyd</b> | You give Agathe a nod out of professional courtesy and stride forward
<b>Floyd</b> | towards her.  She is still smiling.  You wish that people wouldn't do
<b>Floyd</b> | that.  It really unnerves you.  You are a few feet from the bed when
<b>Floyd</b> | THUD!  You stagger back, rubbing your nose.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ouch!" you exclaim.  That hurt!  Gingerly, you reach out and find
<b>Floyd</b> | your hand pressing against some kind of invisible barrier.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It works!  Ha!" Agathe gives a delighted little squeal and claps her
<b>Floyd</b> | hands together.  You gaze down to the floor and see, etched on the
<b>Floyd</b> | wooden floor in a circle around the bed, a white chalk line.  It seems
<b>Floyd</b> | to mark the location of the transparent wall.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "What the Dickenth ith thith?" you demand, gesturing at the floor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Pardon?  I'm sorry?  What did you say?" Agathe screams, staring at
<b>Floyd</b> | you with wide mouth.  You stay silent, your face burning with
<b>Floyd</b> | embarrassment (or at least it would be if your body had the
<b>Floyd</b> | circulation and blood to perform such a function).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I demand to know what thi...what i...what you have done."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You have a lisp?" Agathe cackles, "Oh this is just wonderful!  It
<b>Floyd</b> | gets better and better!  Death has a lisp!  The Grim Reaper has a
<b>Floyd</b> | speech impediment!  How perfect!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I haven't got all day, you know."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Is that your horse?" Agathe is leaning off the bed, peering through
<b>Floyd</b> | the doorway into the corridor outside, where Horse stands to
<b>Floyd</b> | attention.  You stay silent.  She'll explain eventually.  They always
<b>Floyd</b> | do.  When people think they've actually got one over you they can't
<b>Floyd</b> | help but crow about it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You've got a proper skeletal horse.  That's amazing.  A skeletal
<b>Floyd</b> | steed.  Can you say that?  Skeletal steed.  Let me hear you say that."
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a glint in her eye.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This is not going well.  In fact, you think that this is one of the
<b>Floyd</b> | the worst things that's ever happened to you, and you've got a long
<b>Floyd</b> | memory.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, I may as well tell you.  It took me long enough to find out
<b>Floyd</b> | about it, after all." Agathe shrugs "I've spent most of my time and
<b>Floyd</b> | not inconsiderable fortune trying to find out how to cheat you.  I
<b>Floyd</b> | built up a library of old, forgotten and - in at least two cases -
<b>Floyd</b> | forbidden books, pooling the knowledge of the centuries.  I pieced
<b>Floyd</b> | together in several tomes the answer.  Have you ever met Andre Theras,
<b>Floyd</b> | the man who wrote How to Avoid Death?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "That joker?" You roll your eyes "Jutht the onth.  He got it wrong it
<b>Floyd</b> | seemth." You don't take much pleasure in your work but you'd quite
<b>Floyd</b> | enjoyed that day.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, it turns out that he was partly right.  And so was Dr. Ulan
<b>Floyd</b> | Buntil.  And so was Madame Elizabeth Fairy.  They all had bits and
<b>Floyd</b> | pieces of it right.  I put it together and voila!  I have created a
<b>Floyd</b> | barrier around myself that you cannot pass!  And it works!  So you can
<b>Floyd</b> | just sit on your skeletal steed and scram, sir!" Agathe is enjoying
<b>Floyd</b> | herself immensely.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Are you planning to thi...thpen...wait here on your bed for
<b>Floyd</b> | eternity?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I can think of worse places to be." Agathe twinkles, winking at you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So.  What now?  You can't reap her soul until you can get past the
<b>Floyd</b> | invisible barrier - or convince her to leave it.  This is definitely
<b>Floyd</b> | one of your worst days ever.

<b>Floyd</b> | and dusty.  Children run through the streets, shouting and laughing.
<b>Floyd</b> | Men go about their business.  Women stand and gossip, occasionally
<b>Floyd</b> | breaking into laughter.  No-one pays you much attention.  They're all
<b>Floyd</b> | having too much fun to pay any mind to death at the moment.  A path
<b>Floyd</b> | winds east out of the village.  You can see Jimiyu's hut to the north,

<b>Floyd</b> | Horse descends from the clouds and makes a perfect landing in the
<b>Floyd</b> | carpark of the new Blackbury Bank in Swindon, attracting brief
<b>Floyd</b> | attention from two employees who are on a smoking break.  The human
<b>Floyd</b> | survival instinct kicks in and they soon turn their focus back to
<b>Floyd</b> | happier things, such as filling their lungs with tar.  You clamber
<b>Floyd</b> | down from Horse, accidently kicking the door of a black BMW in the

<b>Floyd</b> | the sight of a skeletal horse descending from the heavens then they're
<b>Floyd</b> | not likely to care at all if they happen to see the Grim Reaper
<b>Floyd</b> | hopping on one foot and cursing like a trooper.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Please fill this in, Mr. Reaper." she smiles at you.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "But you've signed it..." the woman shows you the form through the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "No!  That thayth Mr. G. Reaper, not Mr. Groper!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The bank clerk looks at you as though you're the crazy one and then
<b>Floyd</b> | taps away on her computer for a second.  A few minutes later she
<b>Floyd</b> | presents you with a credit card in your name.  She passes you the pen
<b>Floyd</b> | and the sign the back of the card, feeling a wave of pride in your new

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Thank you." you say, turning to leave.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ah, Mr. Reaper?" the bank clerk waves her hand at you, "My pen?"

<b>Floyd</b> | Hut (Near Wajir, Kenya)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's a fairly bare hut, lived in by someone who has learnt the hard
<b>Floyd</b> | lesson that true happiness is not found in possessions.  The bare,
<b>Floyd</b> | dusty floor is going to leave its mark under your toenails for days.
<b>Floyd</b> | Jimiyu Wangai sits on a rickety wicker chair, facing a squat,
<b>Floyd</b> | uncomfortable-looking stool.  Between the two seats is a frail table,
<b>Floyd</b> | on which sits a chess board.

<b>Floyd</b> | You swing the scythe in a circular motion, slicing right through
<b>Floyd</b> | Ernest Busset.  He looks down at himself and then crumples to the

<b>Floyd</b> | first down at his body and then at you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "At least I saw my time machine work before I died," he reasons, "Not

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "On the contrary," you state.  "Everyone theeth the rethulth of their

<b>Floyd</b> | "Please.  I have to know," says Lady McWorthington.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well.  OK." Sir Allan Jones coughed again, wishing he could be

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I know this," Lady McWorthington is annoyed, "Tell me what happened!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "From what we can tell, he...he...appeared to have taken off his boots
<b>Floyd</b> | and socks and wondered around in bare, size fifteen feet.  Then...then
<b>Floyd</b> | a horse came along and stood for a while near him.  Then it appears
<b>Floyd</b> | that he put his socks and boots back on and there was an avalanche.
<b>Floyd</b> | Which killed your husband..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh." Lady McWorthington gasps, "Wait.  What was that about his size

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ummm.  It doesn't quite finish there.  It appears that after

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There is silence.  A clock ticks in the background.  Sir Allan coughs

<b>Floyd</b> | Thomas Brewer sat in the office of the university, his palms sweating
<b>Floyd</b> | nervously.  Professor Johnson peered at him over the rim of his

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You must understand that while we are all very sorry to hear about

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "He's simply missing at this point." Thomas stressed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "...death of Doctor Busset," stressed Johnson "I must insist that you

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Hmmmm..." said Johnson, unconvinced "Still.  I must insist..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At that moment they were interrupted by a student barging into the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Professor Johnson!  Professor Johnson!  Quick!  Turn on the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "What is the meaning of this?" Professor Johnson intoned.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh...let me!" the student stumbled across the room and flicked on the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "What, like warships you mean?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "No, the game 'Battleships'.  Oh no!  You sunk my battleship.  That

<b>Floyd</b> | "That's what you said about chess when you were writing your chess

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "So.  What's your point?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Are you going to pretend that it's sponsored by the President again?"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "A malfunction.  Nothing more." the manager assured the fireman,

<b>Floyd</b> | the sprinkler going off that had alerted him to the fact that one of

<b>Floyd</b> | "No need, I assure you." the manager grinned and waved at the firemen

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I need you to clear up room 247." he barked.

<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm going to call the police.  Ms. Laurent was a valued customer." he

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yes sir." sighed the staff member, shuffling off to undertake the

<b>Floyd</b> | Victoria Salmon stood in front of the Major, inwardly seething.

<b>Floyd</b> | "There is no doubt that the uniform found was yours, Captain, and the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yes sir," snarled Salmon.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The papers seem to bear all the hallmarks of being a forgery by Agent

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "That's right sir." Salmon snapped.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 'Well.  I think that the combination of uniform and papers would

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "So, I think that wraps it up.  It appears that nothing was sabotaged

<b>Floyd</b> | "...described the person he spoke to as a ghastly apparition from the

<b>Floyd</b> | "Maybe he thought you'd forgotten to put your make-up on?" he
