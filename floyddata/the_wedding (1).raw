The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>The Wedding</i>, written by Neil James Brown.  <I>The Wedding</I> was originally released as part of the 1996 Acorn Users Comp, where it took second place. It went on to be nominated for a Xyzzy for Best NPCs.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/The_Wedding'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | "You are cordially invited to the wedding of Deborah and Malcolm at St
<b>Floyd</b> | Jude's Church, Westlowe at 2.30pm." And, scrawled in the corner in
<b>Floyd</b> | what looks like your ex-flatmate Malcolm's handwriting: "Don't forget
<b>Floyd</b> | the paracetamol!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So far so bad. You're no lover of weddings with egotistical aunts and
<b>Floyd</b> | uncles and squealing, hyperactive kids, but you were prepared to put
<b>Floyd</b> | up with it to see your old college chum get hitched. Now, though,
<b>Floyd</b> | things have taken a turn for the worse with a phone call from a posh
<b>Floyd</b> | sounding woman. "I understand you're a friend of Malcolm's" stated the
<b>Floyd</b> | voice on the phone. "You must come over here at once, and try to sort
<b>Floyd</b> | out this mess...". So that's why you find yourself tearing down the
<b>Floyd</b> | motorway towards Westlowe and the mysterious D'Arcy manor...

<b>Floyd</b> | You stand to the south of D'Arcy manor, a building which looks like

<b>Floyd</b> | alarm next to the elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man
<b>Floyd</b> | above the main entrance. Immediately in front of the house is a gravel

<b>Floyd</b> | from their progress so far, you'd say that they are making enough food
<b>Floyd</b> | to keep the Royal family well fed for a good few months. To the west,
<b>Floyd</b> | a swing-door leads into the dining hall, and the main exit is to the
<b>Floyd</b> | southwest. A pantry lies to the south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A pompous and temperamental chef stands around shouting at the staff
<b>Floyd</b> | and chopping things up.

<b>Floyd</b> | Passage
<b>Floyd</b> | Here at the heart of the manor is an oak passageway with doorways
<b>Floyd</b> | leading to most rooms on the ground floor. You can see the great
<b>Floyd</b> | dining hall to the north, and a brass sign above the doorway to the
<b>Floyd</b> | northeast states "Kitchen", but the east and southwest exits hold no
<b>Floyd</b> | clues as to where they lead. The entrance hall is off to the south,
<b>Floyd</b> | and a sturdy door stands in the western wall.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A simple polished table lies in the southeast corner.

<b>Floyd</b> | Entrance Hall
<b>Floyd</b> | The grand entrance hall of D'Arcy manor evokes a twinge of jealousy
<b>Floyd</b> | within you - the grand wooden polished floors and staircase, the
<b>Floyd</b> | expensive chandelier hanging from the high ceiling, the priceless
<b>Floyd</b> | Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why can't you inherit something
<b>Floyd</b> | like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
<b>Floyd</b> | cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the
<b>Floyd</b> | south. Doorways (which are probably more expensive than your entire
<b>Floyd</b> | house) lead off to the east and west, and a passageway lies north.

<b>Floyd</b> | Landing
<b>Floyd</b> | The top of the staircase ends in the middle of the landing which
<b>Floyd</b> | stretches to the east and west. An interesting painting, with striking

<b>Floyd</b> | Drawing room

<b>Floyd</b> | Library
<b>Floyd</b> | Everything in this room looks as if it has taken many weeks to carve,

<b>Floyd</b> | closed, so for light you are reliant on the lamps which are quite
<b>Floyd</b> | attractive mock-ups of candles in candlesticks. An oak table sits in
<b>Floyd</b> | the centre of the room, a grand throne-like chair beside it, for

<b>Floyd</b> | Entrance Hall
<b>Floyd</b> | The grand entrance hall of D'Arcy manor evokes a twinge of jealousy
<b>Floyd</b> | within you - the grand wooden polished floors and staircase, the
<b>Floyd</b> | expensive chandelier hanging from the high ceiling, the priceless
<b>Floyd</b> | Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why can't you inherit something
<b>Floyd</b> | like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
<b>Floyd</b> | cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the
<b>Floyd</b> | south. Doorways (which are probably more expensive than your entire
<b>Floyd</b> | house) lead off to the east and west, and a passageway lies north.

<b>Floyd</b> | Study
<b>Floyd</b> | This room has the air of a gentleman's private study area, though
<b>Floyd</b> | recently it appears to have been taken over by the lady of the house
<b>Floyd</b> | (that is, Sheryl D'Arcy). A hardboard set of shelves against one wall
<b>Floyd</b> | looks completely out of place amid the antique furniture and the
<b>Floyd</b> | gorgeous circular shaped painting on the ceiling. Embroidery rests on
<b>Floyd</b> | a pouffe to one side, and several packs of wool tower alongside the
<b>Floyd</b> | shelves. The front entrance is out to the west, and there is another
<b>Floyd</b> | room to the north.

<b>Floyd</b> | within you - the grand wooden polished floors and staircase, the
<b>Floyd</b> | expensive chandelier hanging from the high ceiling, the priceless
<b>Floyd</b> | Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why can't you inherit something
<b>Floyd</b> | like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
<b>Floyd</b> | cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the
<b>Floyd</b> | south. Doorways (which are probably more expensive than your entire
<b>Floyd</b> | house) lead off to the east and west, and a passageway lies north.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The mother of the bride stands in a corner fretting away to herself as

<b>Floyd</b> | guard. He takes great delight in lifting you up and ejecting you out
<b>Floyd</b> | of the house. "Your name's not down, you're NOT - COMING - IN!" he
<b>Floyd</b> | bellows.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Outside the front entrance
<b>Floyd</b> | You stand to the south of D'Arcy manor, a building which looks like
<b>Floyd</b> | it's straight out of a low budget Bronte TV adaptation. A few modern
<b>Floyd</b> | touches help tie it to the late twentieth century, such as the burglar
<b>Floyd</b> | alarm next to the elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man
<b>Floyd</b> | above the main entrance. Immediately in front of the house is a gravel

<b>Floyd</b> | Everything in this room looks as if it has taken many weeks to carve,

<b>Floyd</b> | closed, so for light you are reliant on the lamps which are quite
<b>Floyd</b> | attractive mock-ups of candles in candlesticks. An oak table sits in

<b>Floyd</b> | anyone feeling particularly studious. A room lies to the south, and a

<b>Floyd</b> | alarm next to the elegant stone carving of a Shakespearian-looking man
<b>Floyd</b> | above the main entrance. Immediately in front of the house is a gravel
<b>Floyd</b> | drive which acts as a car park, and a small road leads off to the
<b>Floyd</b> | south towards the main road. A slabbed path runs around both sides
<b>Floyd</b> | (east and west) of the house.

<b>Floyd</b> | Entrance Hall
<b>Floyd</b> | The grand entrance hall of D'Arcy manor evokes a twinge of jealousy
<b>Floyd</b> | within you - the grand wooden polished floors and staircase, the

<b>Floyd</b> | Compton painting hanging on a wall. Why can't you inherit something
<b>Floyd</b> | like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
<b>Floyd</b> | cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the

<b>Floyd</b> | Everything in this room looks as if it has taken many weeks to carve,
<b>Floyd</b> | with the exception of dodgy book covers protecting some of the awful
<b>Floyd</b> | literature stored here. A vast array of books lie on the two huge
<b>Floyd</b> | shelves, ranging from the ancient to the modern. The curtains are
<b>Floyd</b> | closed, so for light you are reliant on the lamps which are quite
<b>Floyd</b> | attractive mock-ups of candles in candlesticks. An oak table sits in
<b>Floyd</b> | the centre of the room, a grand throne-like chair beside it, for
<b>Floyd</b> | anyone feeling particularly studious. A room lies to the south, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | corridor is out to the west.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | How did I get out of the house at the end? Barbara helped you escape.
<b>Floyd</b> | She fetched Chloe from the Drawing Room, and the three of you walked
<b>Floyd</b> | out past the open-mouthed guard and Mrs D'Arcy, who didn't dare do
<b>Floyd</b> | anything.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What of Sheryl D'Arcy and the guard? A few weeks later, Sheryl boarded
<b>Floyd</b> | a plane to Brazil, planning a nice little holiday there. Due to a
<b>Floyd</b> | freak series of events, she found herself parachuting out over the
<b>Floyd</b> | Amazon, where she was forced to fend for herself for over a month
<b>Floyd</b> | before her husband bothered to send out a search party for her. It
<b>Floyd</b> | proved to be a character-building experience, and she came back a
<b>Floyd</b> | changed woman. D'Arcy manor was converted into a shelter for homeless
<b>Floyd</b> | children.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A near-death experience (caused by a runaway milk float) made the
<b>Floyd</b> | security guard see the error of his ways, and he became a New Age
<b>Floyd</b> | Traveller.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | How is it that I know the names of everyone in the house even though I
<b>Floyd</b> | haven't met them before? Telepathy? Maybe Barbara sent you a fax of
<b>Floyd</b> | names before you got to D'Arcy manor, which wasn't mentioned in the
<b>Floyd</b> | opening text. Or maybe the author's programming skills were limited
<b>Floyd</b> | when he first created the characters.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Where are Malcolm's parents, Mr D'Arcy, the best man, the matron of
<b>Floyd</b> | honour, etc? Malcolm's parents don't get on well with Deborah's
<b>Floyd</b> | parents, so there's a lack of communication on that front. Mr D'Arcy
<b>Floyd</b> | and the best man are out looking for Malcolm, and the matron of honour
<b>Floyd</b> | is still in bed at home, recovering from a hangover.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What kind of a place is D'Arcy Manor? It is a mish-mash of a place,
<b>Floyd</b> | based mainly on my vague idea of what a country house was like. The
<b>Floyd</b> | layout is admittedly very odd. Research proved that the design wasn't
<b>Floyd</b> | totally unfeasible, and a few touches were added here and there to the
<b>Floyd</b> | room descriptions, but nothing major was changed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | How did the guard and Mrs D'Arcy get me to the dungeon? The 'dungeon'
<b>Floyd</b> | is in actual fact a small room in the cellar, behind the wooden door
<b>Floyd</b> | in the tunnel (for those who missed it). Sheryl and the guard dragged
<b>Floyd</b> | you down the cellar and dumped you in the cell, their only concession
<b>Floyd</b> | to human rights being the candle.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Why is it that I could get Deborah to follow me after the dungeon
<b>Floyd</b> | experience but not before? Malcolm said that he wouldn't be able to
<b>Floyd</b> | face Deborah without knowing who was behind the attempts to sabotage
<b>Floyd</b> | the wedding. He was also a bit shaken up after the whole kidnapping
<b>Floyd</b> | business, and didn't want to go wandering around the house. So, you
<b>Floyd</b> | had to bring Deborah to him... but only after you had found out who
<b>Floyd</b> | had been behind it all.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Why would she follow me anyway? You told her that it was something
<b>Floyd</b> | important. You must have an honest face because she believed you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Why is it that the guard stopped me from going in the house at the
<b>Floyd</b> | beginning, but didn't stop me going round to the garden? He is under
<b>Floyd</b> | strict instructions not to let any unauthorised people in the house.
<b>Floyd</b> | His instructions don't say anything about the garden, and since he
<b>Floyd</b> | possesses very little initiative or intelligence, he doesn't stop you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Well, what about X, or Y ? A unique feature of this adventure is its
<b>Floyd</b> | Imagine-O-Vision (TM), which, using its top secret hand-written
<b>Floyd</b> | software engine, allows the player to come up with their own
<b>Floyd</b> | explanations for holes in the plot. (Or, in other words, "Your guess
<b>Floyd</b> | is as good as mine.")

<b>Floyd</b> | like this? Leaving aside feelings of bitterness, you observe a
<b>Floyd</b> | cupboard under the stairs and a bell on a table near the door to the

<b>Floyd</b> | Library
<b>Floyd</b> | Everything in this room looks as if it has taken many weeks to carve,
<b>Floyd</b> | with the exception of dodgy book covers protecting some of the awful
<b>Floyd</b> | literature stored here. A vast array of books lie on the two huge
<b>Floyd</b> | shelves, ranging from the ancient to the modern. The curtains are
<b>Floyd</b> | closed, so for light you are reliant on the lamps which are quite
<b>Floyd</b> | attractive mock-ups of candles in candlesticks. An oak table sits in
<b>Floyd</b> | the centre of the room, a grand throne-like chair beside it, for
<b>Floyd</b> | anyone feeling particularly studious. A room lies to the south, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | corridor is out to the west.
