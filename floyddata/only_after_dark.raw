The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Only After Dark</i>, written by Gunther Schmidl.  <I>Only After Dark</I> was originally released as part of the 1999 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took seventeenth place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Only_After_Dark'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b><I>ANOTHER</I> WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> A lot (most!) of the transcripts contained on this site are, shall we say, family-friendly.

<b>Floyd</b> | The huts of the villagers are strewn around the clearing's border,

<b>Floyd</b> | A large stone circle contains charred wood from last night's bonfire,
<b>Floyd</b> | and there is a rickety wooden platform under one of the lower branches
<b>Floyd</b> | of the tree.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Ranil! Remember to be back on the Dagon tomorrow at sunrise! Unless

<b>Floyd</b> | The sound of the door being opened awakes you with a start. In come

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You are quickly led to the platform in the village center, where the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Don't worry, Ranil, we'll have you out of there in no time," comes
<b>Floyd</b> | Gerhardsen's response. He stands in front of the Elder, taller by
<b>Floyd</b> | almost a head, and begins shouting at him, with Aten translating. The
<b>Floyd</b> | shaman answers back, and soon they are engaged in heated conversation.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Suddenly, you notice something about the shaman that makes you flinch:
<b>Floyd</b> | He is wearing a wolf fur!

<b>Floyd</b> | Shortly after midnight, Davids gently shakes you awake.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I have prepared the salve, Ranil. I have to warn you again - it is
<b>Floyd</b> | very dangerous to stay in wolf-form too long. Are you sure you really
<b>Floyd</b> | want to do this?

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yes."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Davids tells you to remove your clothes, then proceeds to rub the
<b>Floyd</b> | salve into your body. "I'm afraid his is going to hurt. Here," he
<b>Floyd</b> | hands you a piece of wood, "bite down on this."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At first, you feel nothing. Then, a tingle runs over your skin, and
<b>Floyd</b> | then the pain hits you. You fall to the floor, your teeth grinding
<b>Floyd</b> | into the wood, your vision dimmed. Your breath comes in short gasps,
<b>Floyd</b> | and an explosion of pain makes you pass out for a few seconds.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | When you can think clearly again, you open your eyes. Everything is
<b>Floyd</b> | dark, except for a large red blotch in the center of your vision. You
<b>Floyd</b> | inhale deeply and an impossible number of sensations stream from all
<b>Floyd</b> | sides.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Wood, salve, clothes, skin, flesh, blood.
