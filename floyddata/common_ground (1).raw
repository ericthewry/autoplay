The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Common Ground</i> by Stephen Granade.  <i>Common Ground</i> was originally released in 1999, and was a finalist for Best Story in the 1999 Xyzzy Awards.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/1237"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played it, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | Your Bedroom
<b>Floyd</b> |    You've spent a lot of time in this room, enough that it's really
<b>Floyd</b> | beginning to get on your nerves.  You're tired of the stupid posters,
<b>Floyd</b> | you're tired of your stupid bed, you're tired of everything.  You just
<b>Floyd</b> | wish it weren't such a hassle to try to change any of it.  Besides, if
<b>Floyd</b> | you were going to change anything, you'd start with the clothes in your

<b>Floyd</b> | closet.  To the west, across from your window, is a closed door going
<b>Floyd</b> | out.
<b>Floyd</b> |    You see a flowerdy bag here.  Sitting on the vanity is a geode,
<b>Floyd</b> | mascara, eye shadow, pink blush, and foundation.

<b>Floyd</b> | Credits
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game would not be half of what it is without the help and guidance
<b>Floyd</b> | of my crack team of beta-testers:  Mike Kinyon, Dan Shiovitz, Lucian
<b>Floyd</b> | Smith, and Adam Thornton.  They kindly agreed to test the game, even

<b>Floyd</b> | though Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, and Christmas were looming.  It's thanks
<b>Floyd</b> | to them that I was able to finish Common Ground by the end of 1999.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A tip o' the hat to those who made suggestions and reported bugs:
<b>Floyd</b> | David Glasser, Neil deMause, Sam Barlow, Magnus Olsson, Gunther
<b>Floyd</b> | Schmidl, Brendan Milburn, Vincent Lynch, Torbj?rn Andersson, Mark

<b>Floyd</b> | Musante, Eric Mayer, Tim Woerner, and Peter Berman.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Special thanks go to Misty Granade, who, as always, put up with me
<b>Floyd</b> | while I struggled with writing this game; and to everyone who took part
<b>Floyd</b> | in the ifMUD Implementors' Lunch and gave me invaluable advice.  I bet
<b>Floyd</b> | you didn't expect that this game would be the result.

<b>Floyd</b> |    The bus is empty except for you and the bus driver, but it still
<b>Floyd</b> | smells like old people and cigarettes.  At least you have your pick of
<b>Floyd</b> | seats.
<b>Floyd</b> |    The bus driver is looking at you, waiting.

<b>Floyd</b> |    Yellow light from the street lamps makes the parking lot and bus
<b>Floyd</b> | stop look weird.  Old Church Road, running in front of the bus station,
<b>Floyd</b> | is pretty much empty.  The station's behind you to the north.  A bus is

<b>Floyd</b> | idling in front of the station.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You step back from the bus.  The doors hiss shut and the bus jerks into
<b>Floyd</b> | life, lumbering towards the road and away from the station.  You watch
<b>Floyd</b> | the bus windows slide past you, blank with reflected light.  The red
<b>Floyd</b> | taillights grow smaller and smaller and smaller until they're gone.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You shrug your bag onto your shoulder.  It's a fair walk back to the
<b>Floyd</b> | house.
