The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>The Djinni Chronicles</i>, written by J&nbsp;D&nbsp;Berry.  <i>The Djinni Chronicles</i> was originally released as part of the 2000 IF Competition, where it took fourteenth place. You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/923"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.</br>

So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The room was a trap for physical beings.  On one side of the room, a

<b>Floyd</b> | *An implosion of Purpose*
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | *An implosion of Satisfaction*
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Rarely was I summoned again by the same human.  Never were any pleased
<b>Floyd</b> | with what I accomplished.  Until then.  Perhaps his Satisfaction could

<b>Floyd</b> | be used to gain enough Purpose for my permanent freedom.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Labiiq looked out at me, calmly.  "I know you rarely honor requests,
<b>Floyd</b> | but I think you'll feel differently when you hear mine.  First a
<b>Floyd</b> | little background...
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Research from my dig has revealed the location of others of your kind.
<b>Floyd</b> | According to my scrolls, three powerful servants are to wait in a
<b>Floyd</b> | "Room of Choices" for a little boy.  It will be this boy who chooses
<b>Floyd</b> | the fate of the people.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now I won't confirm or deny the validity of this prophecy, but the

<b>Floyd</b> | time for this event is unspecified.  Even if three of you are supposed
<b>Floyd</b> | to be there, there is no mention of when this is to occur.  Other
<b>Floyd</b> | scrolls on this matter claim there are different types of "servants."
<b>Floyd</b> | Some can grant wishes, some exist to wreak havoc, and so on.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I believe this "Room of Choices" is far below my excavation site.  I

<b>Floyd</b> | believe there is a chance a wish-granting servant is there.  I don't
<b>Floyd</b> | believe my men will ever be able to dig below these shifting sands
<b>Floyd</b> | enough to reach there.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | By explaining all of this, I'm giving you an opportunity to build your
<b>Floyd</b> | power and to be one of the choices.  To build your power in the short

<b>Floyd</b> | term, my studies indicate following your nature.  To build your power
<b>Floyd</b> | permanently, you need to become the chosen one.  If you're so chosen,
<b>Floyd</b> | my studies indicate you will have your permanent freedom and even
<b>Floyd</b> | dominion in the world to come.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But first you must get me the wish granter's container."

<b>Floyd</b> | My view was initially blurry because Sela had taken my mirror out

<b>Floyd</b> | in the land.  I'd like to get my hands on the knave who gave her that

<b>Floyd</b> | You're the most beautiful in the land," said the second guard.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Mirror, mirror, I must know more

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | That question was somewhat unexpected since I had heard her previous
<b>Floyd</b> | one so many times.  Yet, always, eventually, a summoner would ask a

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | When Purpose was integrated sufficiently, I could move reflected

<b>Floyd</b> | My view was initially blurry because Sela had taken my mirror out
<b>Floyd</b> | quickly.  I heard a deeper voice in mid-sentence, "... inquiring about
<b>Floyd</b> | the death of Ayla Exeter."  Another voice offered, "It's a shame, it
<b>Floyd</b> | is.  With each passing day, she was becoming the most beautiful woman
<b>Floyd</b> | in the land.  I'd like to get my hands on the knave who gave her that

<b>Floyd</b> | The City Gates
<b>Floyd</b> | The road through the gates was narrow, the gates were made of steel.

<b>Floyd</b> | The room was a trap for physical beings.  On one side of the room, a

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now I won't confirm or deny the validity of this prophecy, but the
<b>Floyd</b> | time for this event is unspecified.  Even if three of you are supposed
<b>Floyd</b> | to be there, there is no mention of when this is to occur.  Other
<b>Floyd</b> | scrolls on this matter claim there are different types of "servants."
<b>Floyd</b> | Some can grant wishes, some exist to wreak havoc, and so on.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I believe this "Room of Choices" is far below my excavation site.  I
<b>Floyd</b> | believe there is a chance a wish-granting servant is there.  I don't
<b>Floyd</b> | believe my men will ever be able to dig below these shifting sands
<b>Floyd</b> | enough to reach there.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | By explaining all of this, I'm giving you an opportunity to build your
<b>Floyd</b> | power and to be one of the choices.  To build your power in the short
<b>Floyd</b> | term, my studies indicate following your nature.  To build your power
<b>Floyd</b> | permanently, you need to become the chosen one.  If you're so chosen,
<b>Floyd</b> | my studies indicate you will have your permanent freedom and even
<b>Floyd</b> | dominion in the world to come.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But first you must get me the wish granter's container."

<b>Floyd</b> | The location of my summoner was a room between the surface of the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The room was a trap for physical beings.  On one side of the room, a
<b>Floyd</b> | portcullis barred the way to the outside.  To the other were the
<b>Floyd</b> | vaults for storage.  A patterned stone wall blocked their unauthorized
<b>Floyd</b> | access.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The remains of a former summoner rested here.  An emerald had taken
<b>Floyd</b> | the place of his head.

<b>Floyd</b> | The summoner known as Seegan stood before me.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Great Djinni," my summoner said with much passion.  "I can't thank
