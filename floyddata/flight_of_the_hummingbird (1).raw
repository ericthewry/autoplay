The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Flight of the Hummingbird</i>, written by Michael Martin.  <I>Flight of the Hummingbird</I> was originally released as part of the 2010 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took eighth place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Flight_of_the_Hummingbird'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.

<b>Floyd</b> | Dr. Sinister is at it again! The Concordance of Powered Response isn't
<b>Floyd</b> | entirely clear on what it is he's planning, but it's big and it's
<b>Floyd</b> | based in his island fortress. This is clearly a task for one of the
<b>Floyd</b> | world's mightiest champions!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Unfortunately, they've had to send you instead; the world's mightiest
<b>Floyd</b> | champions have other emergencies to deal with. New Year's Eve is
<b>Floyd</b> | always rough.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Regardless, this looks by-the-book so far. The containment fields have
<b>Floyd</b> | been put in place. Now all you have to do is get over to his island
<b>Floyd</b> | base, infiltrate it, defeat him, and bring him in.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Good morning, O most worthy overlord. It's too bad that it has become
<b>Floyd</b> | necessary to flee your lovely island base. I will be your autopilot
<b>Floyd</b> | today. Please sit tight while I take us to your orbital redoubt."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Well, that's a good sign, at least. You relax a bit while the
<b>Floyd</b> | landscape dwindles below you and the sky darkens above you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After a few more minutes, the autopilot chimes again. "We're nearly
<b>Floyd</b> | here. I've put you into an east-to-west orbit approaching the station,
<b>Floyd</b> | but you will have to perform the final approach yourself." The launch
<b>Floyd</b> | button recesses into the control panel, and a control stick emerges.
<b>Floyd</b> | "I will, as always, keep your orbit stable as you move. Docking arms
<b>Floyd</b> | will engage once you are stopped at location (1, 0, 0)."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Displays bloom around the window, indicating your present position and
<b>Floyd</b> | velocity. The station itself is now clearly visible to the west.

<b>Floyd</b> | Dr. Sinister is at it again! The Concordance of Powered Response isn't
<b>Floyd</b> | entirely clear on what it is he's planning, but it's big and it's
<b>Floyd</b> | based in his island fortress. This is clearly a task for one of the
<b>Floyd</b> | world's mightiest champions!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Unfortunately, they've had to send you instead; the world's mightiest
<b>Floyd</b> | champions have other emergencies to deal with. New Year's Eve is
<b>Floyd</b> | always rough.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Regardless, this looks by-the-book so far. The containment fields have
<b>Floyd</b> | been put in place. Now all you have to do is get over to his island
<b>Floyd</b> | base, infiltrate it, defeat him, and bring him in.
