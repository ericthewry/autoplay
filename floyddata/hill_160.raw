					<p class="leftalign">
					<span class="fontish smaller">Like ClubFloyd, the idea behind NightFloyd is that a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.<br><br>Unlike ClubFloyd, NightFloyd often takes on significantly larger works of interactive fiction, knowing going in that each one will take multiple sessions (but not always, as you'll see in this transcript). NightFloyd is also a bit more informal than ClubFloyd in that it's only announced on the ifMUD #clubfloyd bulletin board, and the time shifts around to meet player's schedules far more than ClubFloyd does. NightFloyd is organized by genericgeekgirl, aka Adri.<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Hill 160</em> written by Mike Gerwat.
						<I>Hill 160</I> was released as part of the 2014 Interactive Fiction Competition. 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting
						
						
							
								its IFDB page: 
								<a class="decorate" href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=14nc1mkpndddgtfe">Hill 160</a>.

					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing these games, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played these games, and think you might like to at some
						point, I do not recommend reading any further. Instead,
						you might want to return to the <a class="decorate" href=

<b>Floyd</b> | Was it only over a year ago? All the razzamatazz, all the hero
<b>Floyd</b> | marching, over by Christmas they said. You'd been in that bloody
<b>Floyd</b> | factory since the age of 14, gone through all the strikes and misery
<b>Floyd</b> | of the early 1900's now. There seemed a way out. At least you'd get
<b>Floyd</b> | fed and there was the glory of England to fight for. Oh, how merrily
<b>Floyd</b> | you marched away to the depot, not knowing whether or not you'd come
<b>Floyd</b> | home to a hero's welcome and a chest full of medals or become another
<b>Floyd</b> | statistic of the first world conflict in history.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Two months later, all that was knocked out of you. Blanko. Fatigues.
<b>Floyd</b> | March, march march. Orders. Being bawled out by Sergeant Major Grant.
<b>Floyd</b> | Then at the new year, when you'd marched up and down half of France
<b>Floyd</b> | and having had been there for months on end, and stuck for all those
<b>Floyd</b> | dreadful weeks in First Eypre, or Wipers as you learned to call it,
<b>Floyd</b> | thrust into long and badly constructed trench lines, frozen nearly to
<b>Floyd</b> | death out there, you were ready to call it quits.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Another summer has come and gone. You had your first leave and were
<b>Floyd</b> | promoted twice. First to Lance Corporal, then to Full Corporal. Now,
<b>Floyd</b> | you're off back again and you've got a platoon, with a few hardy souls
<b>Floyd</b> | and some new recruits mixed in. Fresh-faced boys, out of the training
<b>Floyd</b> | camp. They are totally raw, and know nothing about the life out here,
<b>Floyd</b> | have been fed all the bloody rubbish that home front propaganda can
<b>Floyd</b> | throw at them. After going through all that training and absolute
<b>Floyd</b> | misery, you are no longer a raw recruit, but are now a hardened
<b>Floyd</b> | veteran, after only a year or so.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's now the autumn of 1915 and here you are in the back of the

<b>Floyd</b> | Inside the Lorry
<b>Floyd</b> | You're in the back of a support lorry which has been driven as far as
<b>Floyd</b> | it can go.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Along with you are your platoon, Sergeant Major Grant and a bunch of
<b>Floyd</b> | other men. They are all lurching about as your lorry makes it's way
<b>Floyd</b> | towards the front lines.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Safe? Not really. You are not safe in here at all. Columns coming up
<b>Floyd</b> | to the front are the favourite targets for the German heavy guns to
<b>Floyd</b> | zero in on. You feel lucky this trip however. Earlier on, the lorry
<b>Floyd</b> | behind you copped it and tipped over. There were no survivors. Your
<b>Floyd</b> | shoulders ache like hell from the horrendous weight of your backpack.
<b>Floyd</b> | The lorry jerks to a stop and you hear the bark of your Sergeant
<b>Floyd</b> | Major:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "All out Mates. Fall in on the road."

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b><b> ]                          About this Game
</b><b>Floyd</b> | The game is based on my studies of World War I. For history buffs,
<b>Floyd</b> | I've changed a few things to suit the game to make it more exciting.
<b>Floyd</b> | War is war and some of the language may offend some people, plus it's
<b>Floyd</b> | definitely not PC! For the competition, I have made it somewhat easier
<b>Floyd</b> | to get through to comply with the Comp rules. When it goes up on the
<b>Floyd</b> | archive, it will be much harder with Release 2. Some of the names were
<b>Floyd</b> | loosely taken from Frederick Manning's "The Middle Parts of Fortune" I
<b>Floyd</b> | have deliberately miss-spelled some of them, so as not to infringe
<b>Floyd</b> | copyright.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I make no money out of this game, since I just want other text
<b>Floyd</b> | adventure players to enjoy the game and also to get a little taste of
<b>Floyd</b> | what war was like back then. If you enjoy this game, you might like to
<b>Floyd</b> | try my much harder game on the archive <span class="floydstyle i">"Genesis Quest" </span>. Also,
<b>Floyd</b> | to learn about the life of someone who's deaf and blind, read <span class="floydstyle i"></span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle i">"Touch Me Please" </span> available on Kindle.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I would welcome sensible comments on the game, plus if anyone's really
<b>Floyd</b> | stuck, mail me also. See the credits and about the author for more
<b>Floyd</b> | details.

<b>Floyd</b> | Safe? Not really. You are not safe in here at all. Columns coming up

<b>Floyd</b> | zero in on. You feel lucky this trip however. Earlier on, the lorry
<b>Floyd</b> | behind you copped it and tipped over. There were no survivors. Your

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your feet ache and you are extremely tired. you had a restless night

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You march along wearily, swinging arms as on parade, just merely

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your men are either side of you, but you keep bumping into them as

<b>Floyd</b> | duckboards, deep puddles and bogs, the rain out here never seems to
<b>Floyd</b> | stop and the ground is extremely wet, even on some dry days, you have

<b>Floyd</b> | heavy guns firing on known German batteries, and to the west, an open
<b>Floyd</b> | field with line of older shell holes, some of which contain dead

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One thing for sure: Once the weather is dry, it won't be too bad once

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At last, you swing into the trench area along with all your men and

<b>Floyd</b> | Another summer has come and gone. You had your first leave and were
<b>Floyd</b> | promoted twice. First to Lance Corporal, then to Full Corporal. Now,
<b>Floyd</b> | you're off back again and you've got a platoon, with a few hardy souls
<b>Floyd</b> | and some new recruits mixed in. Fresh-faced boys, out of the training
<b>Floyd</b> | camp. They are totally raw, and know nothing about the life out here,
<b>Floyd</b> | have been fed all the bloody rubbish that home front propaganda can
<b>Floyd</b> | throw at them. After going through all that training and absolute
<b>Floyd</b> | misery, you are no longer a raw recruit, but are now a hardened
<b>Floyd</b> | veteran, after only a year or so.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's now the autumn of 1915 and here you are in the back of the

<b>Floyd</b> | You're in the back of a support lorry which has been driven as far as
<b>Floyd</b> | it can go.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Along with you are your platoon, Sergeant Major Grant and a bunch of
<b>Floyd</b> | other men. They are all lurching about as your lorry makes it's way
<b>Floyd</b> | towards the front lines.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Safe? Not really. You are not safe in here at all. Columns coming up
<b>Floyd</b> | to the front are the favourite targets for the German heavy guns to
<b>Floyd</b> | zero in on. You feel lucky this trip however. Earlier on, the lorry
<b>Floyd</b> | behind you copped it and tipped over. There were no survivors. Your
<b>Floyd</b> | shoulders ache like hell from the horrendous weight of your backpack.
<b>Floyd</b> | The lorry jerks to a stop and you hear the bark of your Sergeant
<b>Floyd</b> | Major:

<b>Floyd</b> | This rutted road, for want of a better word, leads and winds towards

<b>Floyd</b> | round shell holes, they bridge deep mud, there are duckboards all over
<b>Floyd</b> | the place and it also has gaps in it, making the soldiers have to
<b>Floyd</b> | dodge round and return back to the road again. Another road leads west

<b>Floyd</b> | You follow the Sergeant Major's orders and march along the road with
<b>Floyd</b> | your men falling in with the rest of the column. the road twists and
<b>Floyd</b> | bends, the mist still hangs around to the east and the line of shell
<b>Floyd</b> | holes lies to the west in its irregular line.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your feet ache and you are extremely tired. you had a restless night
<b>Floyd</b> | at the nearby base camp, the thunder of the guns from the front had
<b>Floyd</b> | kept you awake most of the night and the fact that you were going
<b>Floyd</b> | onwards to the front again made things worse.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You march along wearily, swinging arms as on parade, just merely
<b>Floyd</b> | marching dejectedly, the front sucks youin to itself almost as you see
<b>Floyd</b> | the bobbing barrels of the troops in front of you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your men are either side of you, but you keep bumping into them as
<b>Floyd</b> | they twist and turn their way along the road, stepping on to
<b>Floyd</b> | duckboards, deep puddles and bogs, the rain out here never seems to
<b>Floyd</b> | stop and the ground is extremely wet, even on some dry days, you have
<b>Floyd</b> | seen men sink with their heavy loads into deep mud and actually die,
<b>Floyd</b> | you can't always stop either to rescue them, those are your orders but
<b>Floyd</b> | you hate having to obey them at times.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Crossroads</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | You are at the junction of two roads. The north-south road that you
<b>Floyd</b> | are on and an east-west road. To the north lie the trenches. To the
<b>Floyd</b> | east, lies a zone of mist, caused by gun fire from the main British
<b>Floyd</b> | heavy guns firing on known German batteries, and to the west, an open
<b>Floyd</b> | field with line of older shell holes, some of which contain dead
<b>Floyd</b> | bodies, which are unable to be buried. Falling into one of these can
<b>Floyd</b> | mean death. Many of the shell holes are full of water. However they

<b>Floyd</b> | You leave the road, thinking you may find an easier way for your men
<b>Floyd</b> | than the long slog you are currently plowing through. You have entered
<b>Floyd</b> | a zone of mist, wafting up from the gunfire from your artillery,
<b>Floyd</b> | firing sporadically at German batteries. Far to your front, the shells
<b>Floyd</b> | pass over your head. At least you know they won't hit you, or they
<b>Floyd</b> | shouldn't. Rounds have been known to fall short, even back here and
<b>Floyd</b> | you well remember two very good friends of yours falling victim to
<b>Floyd</b> | just one stray round. At the time you cursed the gunners but the
<b>Floyd</b> | shells are in such short supply out here and not very well made that
<b>Floyd</b> | they have been known to land on your own side. As one swishes
<b>Floyd</b> | overhead, sounding like an express train, you move forward toward the
<b>Floyd</b> | misty zone.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Zone of Mist</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | To the east of you, you can make out the huge gun pits that contain
<b>Floyd</b> | the British heavy guns. You see puffs of smoke emerging from the mists
<b>Floyd</b> | as shots are fired and shells pass overhead to the German lines,
<b>Floyd</b> | zeroing in on the enemy batteries. You can't see much in front of you
<b>Floyd</b> | here, just the heads of the troops bobbing up and down marching to and
<b>Floyd</b> | from the front line. Occasionally, you do hear large German shells
<b>Floyd</b> | being aimed at your own gun lines. Even though they fly over your
<b>Floyd</b> | head, they could be a danger to you as the ammo dump and gunline are
<b>Floyd</b> | east of here.

<b>Floyd</b> | You wind your way north. Your men are a mixed lot as you move further
<b>Floyd</b> | towards the front trench lines. You'll soon be settled down once you
<b>Floyd</b> | hit the trenches. You can see them now in the distance. They snake
<b>Floyd</b> | away in hap-hazard lines this way and that like a curved snake. You
<b>Floyd</b> | are getting nearer them as you trudge on. You'll be damn glad to get
<b>Floyd</b> | settled down, whatever that may mean. You hope you'll at least be able
<b>Floyd</b> | to rest your feet.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One thing for sure: Once the weather is dry, it won't be too bad once
<b>Floyd</b> | you reach the trench. You almost feel as if you've come home. No one
<b>Floyd</b> | back in bloody London understands for one moment,what you have to go
<b>Floyd</b> | through out here and you don't want to enlighten them. They ask
<b>Floyd</b> | question after question but they would never understand what your
<b>Floyd</b> | world out here is like. It begins at the gun lines. That inevitable
<b>Floyd</b> | fear and yet, you feel at one with your men. There's a closeness
<b>Floyd</b> | there, with the regulars anyway. These new boys. How long will they
<b>Floyd</b> | last? They fall like flies out here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At last, you swing into the trench area along with all your men and
<b>Floyd</b> | settle yourselves as best as you can. There's that crinkled crude iron
<b>Floyd</b> | fence at the side of the trench, there's the usual parapet and
<b>Floyd</b> | parados, the reasonably dry bottom of the trench and just about enough
<b>Floyd</b> | room to sit down if you're lucky. Since you are the Corporal, you get
<b>Floyd</b> | a slightly better place to sit than do most of your men. The sound of
<b>Floyd</b> | distant ragged gunfire from the front is getting restless. The guns
<b>Floyd</b> | seem disturbed like a swarm of bees.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Trench</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | The Latrine is northeast of here. To northwest are a Communication
<b>Floyd</b> | Trench and a Dugout. No Man's Land is to the west. The atmosphere is
<b>Floyd</b> | tense, since you never know when the next shell might bury you under
<b>Floyd</b> | the earth of your dugout. Fortunately, this is one of the stronger
<b>Floyd</b> | ones and it can resist shell fire, for a short while anyway.

<b>Floyd</b> | Now you are weighed down by your supplies. You make what speed you

<b>Floyd</b> | down, you realise that you are in danger all the way back to the
<b>Floyd</b> | trench.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You make your way towards the trench. As you are nearing it, you hear
<b>Floyd</b> | a shell whiz overhead, it misses you and you carry on faster this
<b>Floyd</b> | time. You finally reach the edge of the trench, heave yourself over
<b>Floyd</b> | the edge of the parados and flop into the trench.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You are shaking now. it's the shock. it always affects you that way.
<b>Floyd</b> | you open your pack and take your canteen. You open it and take a long
<b>Floyd</b> | drink from it and then close it. Your water is laced with cheap rum
<b>Floyd</b> | that you bought from one of your mates. You feel better now and the
<b>Floyd</b> | shaking has ended.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There's not much of the night left. You set the supplies down next to
<b>Floyd</b> | you. Your stomach is now telling you that it's chow time and even
<b>Floyd</b> | though you're dead tired, it's time to dig into that nasty beef.
