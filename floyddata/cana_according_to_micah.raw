					<span class="fontish smaller">The idea behind ClubFloyd
						is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of 
						people meet online to cooperatively play a game of 
						interactive fiction.<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Mentula Macanus: Apocolocyntosis</em> written by Adam Thornton, 
						
						and <em>Cana According To Micah</em> written by Christopher Huang as "Rev. Stephen Dawson".
						Mentula Macanus came in fourth in Spring Thing 2011, and went on to win Best Individual PC in the 2011 XYZZYs.  Cana placed 9th in IF Comp 2011, and went on to hit the finals for Best NPC in the XYZZYs.

<b>Floyd</b> | PREFACE
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This account of the wedding at Cana, by the servant Micah, was
<b>Floyd</b> | considered apocryphal as early as the third century; it was therefore
<b>Floyd</b> | excluded from consideration at the Synod of Hippo in AD 393.  Various
<b>Floyd</b> | surviving texts, notably the writings of Julius of Damascus and of
<b>Floyd</b> | Nestor of Nice, suggest that the account was a late fiction based on
<b>Floyd</b> | the relevant verses in the Gospel of John, intended perhaps as
<b>Floyd</b> | instruction to the faithful.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Of particular interest is the fact that the account was written in the
<b>Floyd</b> | second person, and in liturgical Hebrew instead of the more common
<b>Floyd</b> | Greek or Aramaic of the time.  This latter point implies that "Micah"
<b>Floyd</b> | is not a lowly servant as described in the story, but a mouthpiece, a
<b>Floyd</b> | fictional character through which the actual author -- a much more
<b>Floyd</b> | learned person who might or might not be named Micah -- might speak;
<b>Floyd</b> | whereas the former point supports the hypothesis of Nestor of Nice that
<b>Floyd</b> | the author's primary intention was to engage the reader in the action
<b>Floyd</b> | of an already-existing story, rather than to present an actual
<b>Floyd</b> | eyewitness account.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Be that as it may, it is hoped that this translation will prove to be
<b>Floyd</b> | as edifying to the modern scholar as its original author, whoever that
<b>Floyd</b> | might be, had intended.

<b>Floyd</b> | "There's no more wine."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You straighten up and turn to look at Amos, the head steward.  Outside
<b>Floyd</b> | the kitchen, the wedding party continues in full swing.  Inside, you
<b>Floyd</b> | look at Amos and Amos looks back at you and the disaster looms over
<b>Floyd</b> | both of you.  No more wine!  What would the master say!  For that
<b>Floyd</b> | matter, what would a courtyard full of friends and relatives from all
<b>Floyd</b> | over Judaea say!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Martha (technically one of the guests, but she insisted, as usual, on
<b>Floyd</b> | helping out in the kitchen) interrupts your growing horror to point out
<b>Floyd</b> | that one of the wine jugs is missing.  "You should try to find it.  If
<b>Floyd</b> | we're lucky, there'll be enough wine in it to buy us a little more
<b>Floyd</b> | time."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "A little more time?  Time for what?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Time to get to the market and back, of course.  It's late, but
<b>Floyd</b> | hopefully there'll be one wine merchant still hanging about.  Amos, get
<b>Floyd</b> | a donkey and a small cart, and be quick about it."  Amos scurries off
<b>Floyd</b> | to do as he's told, and Martha turns to you: "And Micah, you see if you
<b>Floyd</b> | can find that missing jug!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Martha hurries off after Amos, through the back garden, avoiding the
<b>Floyd</b> | other guests and leaving you with your half of the mission.  Where on
<b>Floyd</b> | earth could that missing wine jug be?  As you consider the possible
<b>Floyd</b> | hiding places, you notice a flash of red hair disappearing out the
<b>Floyd</b> | doorway into the courtyard.  Just your luck: it's the little orphan
<b>Floyd</b> | brat that Martha and her brother and sister adopted, the one who's been
<b>Floyd</b> | getting underfoot all evening and who's probably heard everything.
<b>Floyd</b> | Hopefully she'll have enough sense to not tell the whole world that
<b>Floyd</b> | you're out of wine.  Hah, you should be so lucky.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Kitchen
<b>Floyd</b> | The kitchen is dim and smoky and cluttered, the result of the chaos of
<b>Floyd</b> | preparing for the wedding, currently underway in the courtyard to the
<b>Floyd</b> | south.  In the northeast corner, the door to the garden stands wide
<b>Floyd</b> | open, in the hopes of letting in some cool air.  Down some steps to the
<b>Floyd</b> | west is the winery.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Except for you and Amos, because you're both ever so reliable, all the
<b>Floyd</b> | other servants have been given leave to go get some rest after the
<b>Floyd</b> | preparations earlier; no-one was expecting a sudden emergency to crop
<b>Floyd</b> | up before it came time to wash the dishes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | All the actual food has been served, except for a plate of honeyed
<b>Floyd</b> | locusts that sits untemptingly nearby, unsurprisingly untouched.

<b>Floyd</b> | Courtyard
<b>Floyd</b> | The courtyard is a large and spacious place, but the crush of wedding
<b>Floyd</b> | guests makes it seem a lot smaller.  Off to the west, the guests gather
<b>Floyd</b> | in smaller, tighter groups under the hanging lamps, and you can see the
<b>Floyd</b> | bridal table to the south.  You could retreat north to the kitchen (not
<b>Floyd</b> | that that would be any better) or northeast to the entryway.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | bridal chamber is to the east, its doorway screened by an elaborate
<b>Floyd</b> | curtain.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see Little Orphan Anna here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Hey, mister!"  Little Anna trots up to you.  "Is it true that there's
<b>Floyd</b> | no more wine?  I saw Martha and Amos get into the cart with the donkey

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Most of the oddity of the room's shape comes from the placement of an
<b>Floyd</b> | alcove, situated just so, to inconvenience any invading evil spirits.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see Little Orphan Anna and a bridesmaid here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Thank you," says the bridesmaid, "I didn't think the old man would
<b>Floyd</b> | ever stop talking, and somehow I just couldn't stop listening to him.
<b>Floyd</b> | It's not that his story was all that long and terrible; it's actually
<b>Floyd</b> | not bad, once you've put the pieces together.  But he would insist on
<b>Floyd</b> | jumping around at random, and repeating some bits over and over."  She
<b>Floyd</b> | sighs and turns to enter the courtyard.  "Well, ask me about the story
<b>Floyd</b> | sometime, if you want to know what it was all about, and I'll tell it
<b>Floyd</b> | to you so that it makes sense.  For now, I'm just going to go and enjoy

<b>Floyd</b> | PREFACE
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This account of the wedding at Cana, by the servant Micah, was
<b>Floyd</b> | considered apocryphal as early as the third century; it was therefore
<b>Floyd</b> | excluded from consideration at the Synod of Hippo in AD 393.  Various
<b>Floyd</b> | surviving texts, notably the writings of Julius of Damascus and of
<b>Floyd</b> | Nestor of Nice, suggest that the account was a late fiction based on
<b>Floyd</b> | the relevant verses in the Gospel of John, intended perhaps as
<b>Floyd</b> | instruction to the faithful.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Of particular interest is the fact that the account was written in the
<b>Floyd</b> | second person, and in liturgical Hebrew instead of the more common
<b>Floyd</b> | Greek or Aramaic of the time.  This latter point implies that "Micah"
<b>Floyd</b> | is not a lowly servant as described in the story, but a mouthpiece, a
<b>Floyd</b> | fictional character through which the actual author -- a much more
<b>Floyd</b> | learned person who might or might not be named Micah -- might speak;
<b>Floyd</b> | whereas the former point supports the hypothesis of Nestor of Nice that
<b>Floyd</b> | the author's primary intention was to engage the reader in the action
<b>Floyd</b> | of an already-existing story, rather than to present an actual
<b>Floyd</b> | eyewitness account.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Be that as it may, it is hoped that this translation will prove to be
<b>Floyd</b> | as edifying to the modern scholar as its original author, whoever that
<b>Floyd</b> | might be, had intended.

<b>Floyd</b> | "There's no more wine."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You straighten up and turn to look at Amos, the head steward.  Outside
<b>Floyd</b> | the kitchen, the wedding party continues in full swing.  Inside, you
<b>Floyd</b> | look at Amos and Amos looks back at you and the disaster looms over
<b>Floyd</b> | both of you.  No more wine!  What would the master say!  For that
<b>Floyd</b> | matter, what would a courtyard full of friends and relatives from all
<b>Floyd</b> | over Judaea say!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Martha (technically one of the guests, but she insisted, as usual, on
<b>Floyd</b> | helping out in the kitchen) interrupts your growing horror to point out
<b>Floyd</b> | that one of the wine jugs is missing.  "You should try to find it.  If
<b>Floyd</b> | we're lucky, there'll be enough wine in it to buy us a little more
<b>Floyd</b> | time."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "A little more time?  Time for what?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Time to get to the market and back, of course.  It's late, but
<b>Floyd</b> | hopefully there'll be one wine merchant still hanging about.  Amos, get
<b>Floyd</b> | a donkey and a small cart, and be quick about it."  Amos scurries off
<b>Floyd</b> | to do as he's told, and Martha turns to you: "And Micah, you see if you
<b>Floyd</b> | can find that missing jug!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Martha hurries off after Amos, through the back garden, avoiding the
<b>Floyd</b> | other guests and leaving you with your half of the mission.  Where on
<b>Floyd</b> | earth could that missing wine jug be?  As you consider the possible
<b>Floyd</b> | hiding places, you notice a flash of red hair disappearing out the
<b>Floyd</b> | doorway into the courtyard.  Just your luck: it's the little orphan
<b>Floyd</b> | brat that Martha and her brother and sister adopted, the one who's been
<b>Floyd</b> | getting underfoot all evening and who's probably heard everything.
<b>Floyd</b> | Hopefully she'll have enough sense to not tell the whole world that
<b>Floyd</b> | you're out of wine.  Hah, you should be so lucky.

<b>Floyd</b> | PREFACE
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This account of the wedding at Cana, by the servant Micah, was
<b>Floyd</b> | considered apocryphal as early as the third century; it was therefore
<b>Floyd</b> | excluded from consideration at the Synod of Hippo in AD 393.  Various
<b>Floyd</b> | surviving texts, notably the writings of Julius of Damascus and of
<b>Floyd</b> | Nestor of Nice, suggest that the account was a late fiction based on
<b>Floyd</b> | the relevant verses in the Gospel of John, intended perhaps as
<b>Floyd</b> | instruction to the faithful.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Of particular interest is the fact that the account was written in the
<b>Floyd</b> | second person, and in liturgical Hebrew instead of the more common
<b>Floyd</b> | Greek or Aramaic of the time.  This latter point implies that "Micah"
<b>Floyd</b> | is not a lowly servant as described in the story, but a mouthpiece, a
<b>Floyd</b> | fictional character through which the actual author -- a much more
<b>Floyd</b> | learned person who might or might not be named Micah -- might speak;
<b>Floyd</b> | whereas the former point supports the hypothesis of Nestor of Nice that
<b>Floyd</b> | the author's primary intention was to engage the reader in the action
<b>Floyd</b> | of an already-existing story, rather than to present an actual
<b>Floyd</b> | eyewitness account.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Be that as it may, it is hoped that this translation will prove to be
<b>Floyd</b> | as edifying to the modern scholar as its original author, whoever that
<b>Floyd</b> | might be, had intended.

<b>Floyd</b> | "There's no more wine."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You straighten up and turn to look at Amos, the head steward.  Outside
<b>Floyd</b> | the kitchen, the wedding party continues in full swing.  Inside, you
<b>Floyd</b> | look at Amos and Amos looks back at you and the disaster looms over
<b>Floyd</b> | both of you.  No more wine!  What would the master say!  For that
<b>Floyd</b> | matter, what would a courtyard full of friends and relatives from all
<b>Floyd</b> | over Judaea say!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Martha (technically one of the guests, but she insisted, as usual, on
<b>Floyd</b> | helping out in the kitchen) interrupts your growing horror to point out
<b>Floyd</b> | that one of the wine jugs is missing.  "You should try to find it.  If
<b>Floyd</b> | we're lucky, there'll be enough wine in it to buy us a little more
<b>Floyd</b> | time."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "A little more time?  Time for what?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Time to get to the market and back, of course.  It's late, but
<b>Floyd</b> | hopefully there'll be one wine merchant still hanging about.  Amos, get
<b>Floyd</b> | a donkey and a small cart, and be quick about it."  Amos scurries off
<b>Floyd</b> | to do as he's told, and Martha turns to you: "And Micah, you see if you
<b>Floyd</b> | can find that missing jug!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Martha hurries off after Amos, through the back garden, avoiding the
<b>Floyd</b> | other guests and leaving you with your half of the mission.  Where on
<b>Floyd</b> | earth could that missing wine jug be?  As you consider the possible
<b>Floyd</b> | hiding places, you notice a flash of red hair disappearing out the
<b>Floyd</b> | doorway into the courtyard.  Just your luck: it's the little orphan
<b>Floyd</b> | brat that Martha and her brother and sister adopted, the one who's been
<b>Floyd</b> | getting underfoot all evening and who's probably heard everything.
<b>Floyd</b> | Hopefully she'll have enough sense to not tell the whole world that
<b>Floyd</b> | you're out of wine.  Hah, you should be so lucky.

<b>Floyd</b> | Out On The Street
<b>Floyd</b> | The road to town stretches off to the south, and the house is back to
<b>Floyd</b> | the west.  The dust has finally settled from the arrival of guests,
<b>Floyd</b> | and, compared to the noisy hubbub back in the courtyard, the street is
<b>Floyd</b> | blissfully quiet.  It's probably even more quiet by the village well,
<b>Floyd</b> | across the street to the east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A few soldiers are hanging about nearby, looking stealthy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can also see Little Orphan Anna, a bridesmaid and an ancient
<b>Floyd</b> | mariner here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The bridesmaid glances hopefully at the soldiers following you -- and
<b>Floyd</b> | you know she must be pretty desperate if she's expecting help from
<b>Floyd</b> | Herod's guards -- but they pretend not to notice.  One of them peers

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Most of the oddity of the room's shape comes from the placement of an

<b>Floyd</b> | This is about as far from the maddening crowd as you can get, without

<b>Floyd</b> | for the man, so he must be quite devastated at this turn of events.  It
<b>Floyd</b> | is while musing over this that you catch sight, out of the corner of
<b>Floyd</b> | your eye, of a flash of red hair vanishing behind the lone tree in the
<b>Floyd</b> | middle of the field.  For a moment, you think, could it be Little Anna?
<b>Floyd</b> | Before you know it, you find yourself in the middle of the field, under
<b>Floyd</b> | the tree.  Little Anna is nowhere in sight.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Potter's Field
<b>Floyd</b> | This field isn't much to look at.  There's a tall tree, more dead than
<b>Floyd</b> | alive; there are some rocks and a lot of clay.  The road is off to the
<b>Floyd</b> | south, and a small stream is to the west.
