The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    On an ancient, crumbling clay tablet lie the words writ by a wise
<b>Floyd</b> | Assyrian scribe some 4000 years ago:  "The gods do not subtract from
<b>Floyd</b> | the alloted span of men's lives the hours spent on fishing."  It is in
<b>Floyd</b> | the spirit of these words that you have gone into your garage,
<b>Floyd</b> | unearthed the fishing equipment passed down to you by your father, and
<b>Floyd</b> | called in sick for several days so that you may seek the pleasure of
<b>Floyd</b> | one of the oldest sports known to humanity.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You drive into a national park well known for its fishing, and,
<b>Floyd</b> | parking your vehicle and yourself by a crowded lake, proceed to bring
<b>Floyd</b> | in a haul as large as your permit allows you.  But as the days go by,
<b>Floyd</b> | you feel that the challenge of rod and reel has left.  You find
<b>Floyd</b> | yourself limply tossing back the fish you so easily hooked upon your
<b>Floyd</b> | line.  You look within that part of your soul that has to do with
<b>Floyd</b> | fishing, and come up with void.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    In frustration, you somehow wander into an old general store by the
<b>Floyd</b> | lake.  A century ago it was owned by a man whose name is now nearly
<b>Floyd</b> | illegible on the sign; today it is a concession stand for fast food.
<b>Floyd</b> | Still, mingling with the smell of hamburgers and fries are a group of
<b>Floyd</b> | graybeards, sitting on the porch and talking about days gone by.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You find yourself engrossed in their conversation, about catches of
<b>Floyd</b> | yesteryear, and struggles against the mighty fish of the past.  And,
<b>Floyd</b> | always mentioned in hushed whispers, is a legendary fish called only
<b>Floyd</b> | "The Old One."  Fifty, perhaps a hundred or two hundred pounds, long
<b>Floyd</b> | as the tallest pine and wilder than the savage bear of the forest, and
<b>Floyd</b> | appearing only once every thirty years, The Old One has defied the
<b>Floyd</b> | fishing poles of men for centuries.  "They even say," says one man,
<b>Floyd</b> | "The Old One even carried away the bride-to-be of ol' Bob of the bait
<b>Floyd</b> | store, though he never really believed it.  That I heard when I was a
<b>Floyd</b> | boy of five, that I did!"  There are chuckles all around.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    After an awkward silence, one of the men says, "But The Old One
<b>Floyd</b> | only appears once every thirty years, don't it?"  "Uh-huh," replies
<b>Floyd</b> | another.  "In fact, it's appearing this year, ain't it?"  There are
<b>Floyd</b> | more chuckles all around as you quietly excuse yourself from their
<b>Floyd</b> | company.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    That night you toss and turn in your tent as visions of The Old One
<b>Floyd</b> | swim in your mind.  You are almost out of bait and money, but perhaps,
<b>Floyd</b> | just perhaps, you might have a chance.  And so, at five o'clock in the
<b>Floyd</b> | morning, you slip away from camp, with only a rod, tackle box and
<b>Floyd</b> | thermos of coffee in hand, down the trail the old men told you about.
<b>Floyd</b> | You feel the thrill of fishing return to you as you make your way down
<b>Floyd</b> | to Lake Highwater.  Somehow, you think, you will succeed where others
<b>Floyd</b> | have failed.  You are sure that The Old One will not be...

<b>Floyd</b> | Path to Lake
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    This ancient dirt path, no doubt trod on by generations of stalwart
<b>Floyd</b> | anglers, leads north to Lake Highwater.  The path is surrounded by
<b>Floyd</b> | lush green grass and tall pine trees which fill your welcoming eyes
<b>Floyd</b> | with green.  In the distance, small birds chirp and the occasional
<b>Floyd</b> | deer can be seen scampering through the woods.  The only anomaly in
<b>Floyd</b> | the landscape is the large, unsightly mound of dirt sitting next to a
<b>Floyd</b> | pile of rocks.  To the west is Bob's Fish 'N Bait Store.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    The following transcript is probably not exactly like your own
<b>Floyd</b> | fishing experience, but gives you an idea of what you can do with your
<b>Floyd</b> | new fishing pole.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Foredeck
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    This is the foredeck of the USS Tuna Melt, a fishing boat off the
<b>Floyd</b> | Baja California coast.  The deck is wet with the waters of the sea and
<b>Floyd</b> | the air has its distinctive salt taste.  You can go aft.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt; INVENTORY
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You are carrying a fishing pole and a tackle box.  The fishing line
<b>Floyd</b> | seems to contain a hook.  The tackle box seems to contain a shrimp and
<b>Floyd</b> | a plastic bobber.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt; LOOK AT LINE
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You see attached to the line a hook.  On the hook you see nothing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt; TIE BOBBER TO LINE
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You tie the bobber securely to the line.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Old Man Pete, your captain on this voyage, wanders on deck.  He is
<b>Floyd</b> | smoking a pipe agitatedly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt; PETE, HELLO
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Avast, and shiver me timbers!"  growls Pete, who flexes his
<b>Floyd</b> | grotesquely oversized biceps restlessly.  "Aar, keep fishing!  I'll
<b>Floyd</b> | give you this gold doubloon to you if you catch the infamous fish,
<b>Floyd</b> | Doby the Mackrel!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt; PUT THE SHRUMP ON THE HOOK
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sorry, I don't know the word 'shrump'.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt; OOPS SHRIMP
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You slide the shrimp easily onto the hook.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A sudden wave splashes onto deck, drenching everyone.  The water
<b>Floyd</b> | extinguishes Pete's pipe.  "%#&@$*( sea," he yells angrily as he
<b>Floyd</b> | plucks a sardine from the pipe.  "Can't a man get a decent smoke
<b>Floyd</b> | anymore?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt; ASK PETE ABOUT SHRIMP
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Aar, if ye don't catch Doby soon you'll be eatin' yer bait instead of
<b>Floyd</b> | returning it to the sea," warns Pete.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt; CAST LINE
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You swing the line back a long way, nearly snagging Pete with the
<b>Floyd</b> | line.  "Watch where ye put that line, ye landlubber!"  With a strong
<b>Floyd</b> | snap of the wrist, you launch the line and its contents into the sea.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt; Z
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Time passes...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Aar, where's me lighter?"  growls Pete.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt; Z
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Time passes...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt; Z
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Time passes...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt; Z
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You feel a tug at the line!  It's weak, yet persistent, and getting
<b>Floyd</b> | stronger by the second!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt; REEL IN LINE
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You start reeling in the line when it snags!  You pull, and pull, but
<b>Floyd</b> | it won't come up!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt; REEL IN LINE
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your pole bends so much from your effort that you think it's going to
<b>Floyd</b> | snap.  And suddenly, with a "Whoosh!", your line comes screaming back
<b>Floyd</b> | at you, knocking you to the deck!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt; LOOK AT HOOK
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You see a mackrel on the hook.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "That's not Doby the Mackrel," says Pete angrily.  "You incompetent
<b>Floyd</b> | landlubber, when will you learn!  Get below and get more shrimp!  I
<b>Floyd</b> | won't rest until Doby the Mackrel is caught!"  "Curse you, Doby the
<b>Floyd</b> | Mackrel, curse you!"  Pete exclaims, shaking his fist at the sea.
<b>Floyd</b> | "From Hell's heart I stab at thee...for hate's sake I spit my last
<b>Floyd</b> | breath at thee!"  You involuntarily twist your body to avoid his
<b>Floyd</b> | flying saliva...

<b>Floyd</b> | he says, "Yes, that was my beloved Nellie.  She loved fishing as much
<b>Floyd</b> | as I did; we were perfect together.I didn't make that much money, only
<b>Floyd</b> | being a humble seller of bait, but I even managed to scrape together
<b>Floyd</b> | enough to buy her a gold bracelet with her name engraved on it.
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, on her sixteenth birthday, her father finally gave consent
<b>Floyd</b> | for us to get married, and I was the happiest man on the earth.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | However, the day of our wedding, I was all dressed up and ready for
<b>Floyd</b> | the ceremony, but Nellie didn't show up.  We searched all around but
<b>Floyd</b> | couldn't find her.That's when I remembered there was some rich
<b>Floyd</b> | European guy who'd been also wooing Nellie, and it dawned on me that
<b>Floyd</b> | even my little gold bracelet wouldn't be enough to compete with the
<b>Floyd</b> | expensive trinkets he could buy without a second thought.My friends
<b>Floyd</b> | tried to console me; they said, 'Nellie's like Lake Highwater!  She's
<b>Floyd</b> | not so shallow she would follow riches instead of her heart!' But as
<b>Floyd</b> | the day ended and there was no sign of Nellie, I was forced to
<b>Floyd</b> | conclude she had left me for the European.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At midnight, when I was drinking myself silly, my friend Zeke came up
<b>Floyd</b> | to me and said some guy saw Nellie that day, and that she'd been
<b>Floyd</b> | fishing on the pier and was pulled under by The Old One!  I didn't
<b>Floyd</b> | believe Zeke.Even at 14 I'd told many a tall tale about fishing, and I
<b>Floyd</b> | figured Zeke made that up to make me feel better.  Never did hear from
<b>Floyd</b> | Nellie again.  Her father died of heartbreak shortly thereafter.  I

<b>Floyd</b> | about to collapse.  You rush behind the counter to help him, but he
<b>Floyd</b> | recovers enough to thump himself several times in the chest.  Shaking
<b>Floyd</b> | his head as if to clear his mind, he stares at the photo again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It's The Old One!"  he gasps.  "Look at it!  That's the largest
<b>Floyd</b> | bluegill I ever saw!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Um, a bluegill?"  you ask."Yeah," says Bob, pointing out some
<b>Floyd</b> | features on the fish.  "you can tell by the..."  His voice trails off,
<b>Floyd</b> | and you realize that a biology lesson is right now not the most
<b>Floyd</b> | important thing about the moment.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Nellie," says Bob with a sigh.  "I know that's The Old One,
<b>Floyd</b> | because..."  He points to the golden bracelet around The Old One's
<b>Floyd</b> | tail.  "Because that's Nellie's bracelet.  It was just like Zeke said.
<b>Floyd</b> | I guess...she didn't really leave me for that rich guy after all.  She
<b>Floyd</b> | never intended to."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Um, I'm sorry," you say, not knowing what to say.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You should be!"  Bob snorts, life coming back to him.  "You have The
<b>Floyd</b> | Old One *that* close, and ya let it get away!  Young whippersnappers
<b>Floyd</b> | nowadays, they're as feeble as I thought."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But Bob's tone cheers up as he slips the photo under the counter.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Still, I have to congratulate you on what ya did.  Before 1935, no
<b>Floyd</b> | one had a better picture of The Old One than this.  I always wanted ta
<b>Floyd</b> | see The Old One with my own eyes, and I didn't want to die before I
<b>Floyd</b> | did."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Wait a second," you say.  "This doesn't mean you're not going to..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Of course not!"  says Bob.  "Just because I done near had a heart
<b>Floyd</b> | attack when I saw that picture doesn't mean I'm going to keel over and
<b>Floyd</b> | die after I've achieved my ambition of seeing that blasted fish!  I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | gonna wait, right here, until someday someone brings in The Old One,
<b>Floyd</b> | straight from the water, to this here bait shop!  Maybe I'll even try
<b>Floyd</b> | it myself!"  You find yourself in awe at the old man's grim
<b>Floyd</b> | determination.  "Besides," he says, shoulders slumping a fraction of
<b>Floyd</b> | an inch, "if I don't live, who's gonna take care of poor Zeke's 170
<b>Floyd</b> | year-old great-grandmother when he dies?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And so your fishing odyssey at Lake Highwater comes to an end.  Out of

<b>Floyd</b> | happily out of the bait store, ready for the long hike home, you cast
<b>Floyd</b> | one more glance at the beautiful blue surface of Lake Highwater.  You
<b>Floyd</b> | spot a shape in the middle, and strain for a second to take a look.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's The Old One, leaping high into the air, as if to bid you
<b>Floyd</b> | farewell, the golden bracelet around its tail gleaming in the
<b>Floyd</b> | sunlight.  You smile and nod, and find yourself saluting this rugged
<b>Floyd</b> | fish, all the while, thinking, "In thirty years!  I'll be back!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As if to acknowledge the receipt of your challenge, The Old One waves
