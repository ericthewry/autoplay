The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of the two games entered in David Fisher's 2009 <A HREF="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/EnvComp">EnvComp</A>: <i>La Seine</i>, by Derek Sutcliffe, and <i>Dead Like Ants</i>, by C.E.J. Pacian.  You can learn more about these games, including how to download them, by visiting either the page for <A HREF="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/La_Seine"><u><I>La Seine</I></u></A> or <A HREF="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Dead_Like_Ants"><u><I>Dead Like Ants</I></u></A> on the ifWiki, respectively.</br></br>As for the trascripts below, you can jump directly to the second game by clicking <a href="#ants">here</A>.</br>

<b>Floyd</b> | Pr?s du parc
<b>Floyd</b> | You're standing on a gently sloping hill near a popular Parisian park.
<b>Floyd</b> | To the north you can see lots of people enjoying the summer day. Those

<b>Floyd</b> | light of the way you're feeling, you might want to follow their lead.

<b>Floyd</b> | It's slightly after noon and the sun is beating down on you.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | When I decided to enter EnvComp, I had no idea what setting I was
<b>Floyd</b> | going to use. But I thought about it for a while, and knew I wanted a
<b>Floyd</b> | slightly deceptive one. A setting the player wouldn't identify

<b>Floyd</b> | correctly right away. It was hard to think of a situation like that,
<b>Floyd</b> | and eventually I settled on the player being stuck in a painting. It
<b>Floyd</b> | seemed like a unique, exciting setting.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm not actually a huge art lover or anything. I determined which
<b>Floyd</b> | painting I was going to use by searching the internet for "famous

<b>Floyd</b> | paintings," and then picking the first one I recognized. I remembered
<b>Floyd</b> | seeing a reproduction of Seurat's A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of
<b>Floyd</b> | La Grande Jatte in my dentist's office when I was a kid. Anyway, I had
<b>Floyd</b> | to research its name, author, and history to write the game, because I
<b>Floyd</b> | knew very little about it at first.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | I tried to drop as many hints in the painting world as possible,
<b>Floyd</b> | hoping that someone familiar with some aspect of the work (its
<b>Floyd</b> | characters, its pointillism, its setting, its author, etc.) may think
<b>Floyd</b> | to try escaping from it without having to solve any puzzles at all.
<b>Floyd</b> | Which is very possible, although the commands available for doing so
<b>Floyd</b> | vary depending how many points you have.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The puzzles were simple to make. The plot, however, was difficult to
<b>Floyd</b> | flesh out. Some cultures think that being photographed steals part of
<b>Floyd</b> | your soul. Who's to say that the subject of a portrait or landscape
<b>Floyd</b> | isn't somehow imbued in the canvas? Somehow, the player character
<b>Floyd</b> | enters the dreamlike territory of the painting itself (Maybe it's a

<b>Floyd</b> | special ability?) either without realizing it or without remembering
<b>Floyd</b> | it. He then wanders about, setting things right in the painting, until
<b>Floyd</b> | the little girl in white, the most knowledgeable 'soul' there, tells
<b>Floyd</b> | him where he is. It's up to the player to attempt commands like &gt;LEAVE
<b>Floyd</b> | PAINTING or &gt;EXIT LA GRANDE JATTE after some prodding and hinting from

<b>Floyd</b> | this character.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The npcs aren't very fleshed out, but my convenient excuse is that
<b>Floyd</b> | most of them are literally two-dimensional painting characters, ones
<b>Floyd</b> | who have no wish to interact with an outsider anyway. The animals, and
<b>Floyd</b> | the few people that do respond to the character, are simply special

<b>Floyd</b> | cases.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks for playing my first game.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Cots line one side of the chamber, each holding a formless, swaddled

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One of your daughters leans a framed painting against the wall and

<b>Floyd</b> | Sounds of merriment and raised voices carry into the chamber from
<b>Floyd</b> | outside.

<b>Floyd</b> | I just tried to write a human story about being an ant.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | inhabitants of the tree hollow all wear red because they're red ants.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The widow isn't supposed to be any kind of spider in particular, and
<b>Floyd</b> | certainly not an actual black widow.  It's my understanding that the
<b>Floyd</b> | chief problem any male spider has while attempting to procreate
<b>Floyd</b> | involves approaching a female spider in her web without appearing to
<b>Floyd</b> | be edible - which, of course, he actually is.  I'm sure that some
<b>Floyd</b> | females are easier to get close to than others.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You may have noticed that the only character in this game with a name
<b>Floyd</b> | is the late Cornu Aspersa Esq.  His name is the Latin term for a
<b>Floyd</b> | common snail, in case you didn't already know.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game owes something of a debt to Hans Christian Andersen, Lewis

<b>Floyd</b> | Carroll and Anna Anthropy's In The Woods.
