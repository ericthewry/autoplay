The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>The Bryant Collection</i>, written by Gregory Weir.  <i>The Bryant Collection</i> was originally released in 2009.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/The_Bryant_Collection"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room

<b>Floyd</b> | You've never been an especially tidy person, and being self-employed
<b>Floyd</b> | has done nothing to improve your habits.  Still, you keep your place
<b>Floyd</b> | clean, for the most part.  It's just cluttered.  The clutter is worse
<b>Floyd</b> | than usual at the moment, thanks to a portion of the contents of the
<b>Floyd</b> | strongbox scattered over the surface of your table.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The strongbox itself sits open under the table.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the wooden table are a pile of letters, a memo book labeled "The End
<b>Floyd</b> | of the World", a composition book labeled "Morning in the Garden", a
<b>Floyd</b> | sketchbook labeled "The Tower of Hanoi", a stapled packet labeled
<b>Floyd</b> | "Going Home Again", an envelope labeled "Undelivered Love Letter", a

<b>Floyd</b> | wrinkled sheet of paper, and a wooden toy.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In 2008, I found a collection of papers in an old strongbox that I
<b>Floyd</b> | purchased on a whim from a yard sale. They were labeled as part of the

<b>Floyd</b> | contents of the attic of a distant, deceased cousin of the family
<b>Floyd</b> | selling the box. Her name was Laura Bryant, and it seemed the family
<b>Floyd</b> | selling the box had not known her very well at all. Unfortunately, I
<b>Floyd</b> | never caught the seller's name, and I haven't been able to find out
<b>Floyd</b> | anything about Ms. Bryant's identity except what I learned from the
<b>Floyd</b> | contents of the box.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The box contained at least a hundred sets of papers, some stapled or
<b>Floyd</b> | paper-clipped and others stuffed into manilla envelopes. There were a
<b>Floyd</b> | few letters and explanatory sheets, but the overwhelming majority of
<b>Floyd</b> | the pages were devoted to "story worlds," as Ms. Bryant called them.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | These story worlds seem to be analogues to what we call interactive
<b>Floyd</b> | fiction.  They're not as rigorously specified, of course; their
<b>Floyd</b> | descriptions sometimes bear more resemblance to the outline for a
<b>Floyd</b> | roleplaying game campaign than Inform source code. However, they seem
<b>Floyd</b> | to be intended for a single player, or at least a single main
<b>Floyd</b> | character, and they have a strangely familiar approach to their

<b>Floyd</b> | interaction model.  The papers indicate that the player would dictate
<b>Floyd</b> | actions to the person with the notes for the world, and would receive
<b>Floyd</b> | responses in a very turn-based fashion.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The most interesting part is that these worlds seem to have been
<b>Floyd</b> | developed completely independently of the precursors to modern IF.  The

<b>Floyd</b> | earliest piece is from 1964, before Crowther and Woods's Adventure,
<b>Floyd</b> | Arneson and Gygax's Dungeons & Dragons, or even Wesely's Braunstein.
<b>Floyd</b> | In addition, Bryant had no connection to computers or wargaming; she
<b>Floyd</b> | worked as a middle-school English teacher in a time when there were
<b>Floyd</b> | definitely no computers in public schools, and there's no sign that she
<b>Floyd</b> | ever used a computer herself.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I've "transcribed" a few of the story worlds into IF form, hoping that
<b>Floyd</b> | someone might be interested in playing IF written by someone who
<b>Floyd</b> | apparently had no familiarity with text adventures or even computers.
<b>Floyd</b> | Of course, I've had to take some liberties with the texts to make them
<b>Floyd</b> | work as IF; for the curious, I've included a partial example of an

<b>Floyd</b> | original description for one of the story worlds.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I hope you have as much fun exploring these worlds as I did discovering
<b>Floyd</b> | them.

<b>Floyd</b> | Beside the Tree
<b>Floyd</b> | You're beside the biggest tree.  Its branches stretch miles overhead,

<b>Floyd</b> | and its roots are like the trunks of saplings.  The ground here is soft
<b>Floyd</b> | and green with grass and moss.  At the edges of this clearing, plants
<b>Floyd</b> | grow thick.  They're all blossoming and fruiting at once, filling the
<b>Floyd</b> | air with perfume.  A wide path leads out of the clearing and back to
<b>Floyd</b> | the rest of the garden.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Hanging low from a branch of the tree is a large fruit.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Serpent walks into the clearing.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Tower of Hanoi

<b>Floyd</b> | by Laura Bryant
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You finally got here.  It was an arduous journey, but you're finally at
<b>Floyd</b> | the top of the fabled Tower of Hanoi.  Before you is the priceless
<b>Floyd</b> | Amber Star, the most sought-after jewel in the world.  There's just one
<b>Floyd</b> | problem.  How are you supposed to get to it?

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Purple Room
<b>Floyd</b> | This is a tiny, round room.  Its walls are painted a rich purple.  In
<b>Floyd</b> | the center of the room is a round stone column.  There is a hexagonal
<b>Floyd</b> | window on the right wall.  A big cage is built into the wall, enclosing
<b>Floyd</b> | the window and occupying almost half of the room.  In the floor of the

<b>Floyd</b> | cage is a square hole, through which you can see an impassable blue
<b>Floyd</b> | stone surface.  Stairs outside the cage lead down through the floor,
<b>Floyd</b> | where you can see a room with blue walls.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the cage is a glass case containing an enormous jewel.

<b>Floyd</b> | suitcase in your old room before you go out to dinner.  Your parents
<b>Floyd</b> | are waiting in the car.  There'll be time to reminisce after you all
<b>Floyd</b> | eat.  Still, this is the first time you've been back since you

<b>Floyd</b> | graduated from college.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Laundry Room
<b>Floyd</b> | This is the first room off of the garage, with a washer and dryer and
<b>Floyd</b> | some storage.  The cabinets above the dryer are where your mom always
<b>Floyd</b> | kept old rags for dusting, and all sorts of junk is stacked on the

<b>Floyd</b> | shelves across from them.  The kitchen is through a doorway, and your
<b>Floyd</b> | parents are waiting in the garage just outside this room.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Undelivered Love Letter
<b>Floyd</b> | by Laura Bryant

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This was supposed to be a nice visit, a respite from the loneliness of
<b>Floyd</b> | a long-distance relationship.  Yesterday evening, she broke the news to
<b>Floyd</b> | you.  You didn't eat at all today.  Right now, she's in the bathroom,
<b>Floyd</b> | but she'll be back in time for a final goodbye.  Then you'll leave on
<b>Floyd</b> | the plane, she'll stay here, and you'll never see her again.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Terminal
<b>Floyd</b> | Passengers bustle through this busy airport terminal, on their way to
<b>Floyd</b> | and from their planes.  You're waiting near your gate, among twenty or
<b>Floyd</b> | thirty seats.  A gate agent bustles about near the gate.  Large windows
<b>Floyd</b> | overlook the tarmac, where you can see your plane sitting at the end of

<b>Floyd</b> | the loading bridge.  The restrooms are across the hallway, and the
<b>Floyd</b> | security checkpoint is a decent walk away.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Terminal
<b>Floyd</b> | Passengers bustle through this busy airport terminal, on their way to

<b>Floyd</b> | and from their planes.  You're waiting near your gate, among twenty or
<b>Floyd</b> | thirty seats.  A gate agent bustles about near the gate.  Large windows
<b>Floyd</b> | overlook the tarmac, where you can see your plane sitting at the end of
<b>Floyd</b> | the loading bridge.  The restrooms are across the hallway, and the
<b>Floyd</b> | security checkpoint is a decent walk away.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | A big clock is mounted on the wall nearby.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can also see X here.

<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room
<b>Floyd</b> | You've never been an especially tidy person, and being self-employed
<b>Floyd</b> | has done nothing to improve your habits.  Still, you keep your place
<b>Floyd</b> | clean, for the most part.  It's just cluttered.  The clutter is worse

<b>Floyd</b> | than usual at the moment, thanks to a portion of the contents of the
<b>Floyd</b> | strongbox scattered over the surface of your table.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the wooden table are a tiny purple disk, a memo book labeled "The
<b>Floyd</b> | End of the World", a composition book labeled "Morning in the Garden",
<b>Floyd</b> | a sketchbook labeled "The Tower of Hanoi", a stapled packet labeled

<b>Floyd</b> | "Going Home Again", and an envelope labeled "Undelivered Love Letter".
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can also see a wooden toy, a large orange disk, a huge red disk, a
<b>Floyd</b> | small blue disk, a medium-small green disk, a medium-large yellow disk,
<b>Floyd</b> | an old dented strongbox (empty), a pile of letters, and a wrinkled
<b>Floyd</b> | sheet of paper here.
