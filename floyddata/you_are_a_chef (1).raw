The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of two games.  The first, <I>You Are a Chef!</I>, was written by Dan Shiovitz as part of Speed-IF 8 in 2000, and it was nominated for the Best Writing Xyzzy that year. You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/You_are_a_Chef!'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br>The second game, <i>Janitor</i>, was written by Peter Seebach and Kevin Lynn.  <I>Janitor</I> was originally released as part of the 2002 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took fifth place. It went on to be nominated for a Xyzzy in the category of Best Individual PC.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Janitor'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>, and you can jump straight to that part of the transcript by clicking <A HREF="#janitor"><U>here</U></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | Basement
<b>Floyd</b> | The basement smells faintly of mold. The walls are constructed of
<b>Floyd</b> | solid concrete. A trap door is set in the ceiling above. Doorways lead
<b>Floyd</b> | north, east, and west, while a hole in the wall leads into a natural
<b>Floyd</b> | cavern to the south. Thin grooves are worn in the floor, leading into
<b>Floyd</b> | the room to the west.
<b>Floyd</b> | In the northeast corner, a floating arrangement of glowing blue runes
<b>Floyd</b> | indicates the location of access door W1S, which is open.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An uncovered ladder leads up to the trap door.

<b>Floyd</b> | the safety and motivational posters, a pin-up calendar adorns the
