The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Fish!</i>, written by Magnetic Scrolls Ltd..  <I>Fish!</I> was released in 1988 by Magnetic Scrolls Ltd.  It was written by John Molloy, Pete Kemp, Phil South, and Rob Steggles.  Graphics were created by Geoff Quilley, Alan Hunnisett, Chris Kent, Richard Selby, and Tristan Humphries, with cover art by Duncan McLean.  It was programmed by Richard Huddy and Bob Coles.  Music and goodies were created by John Molloy.  You can learn more about the game, including how to play it yourself, by visiting <A HREF='http://msmemorial.if-legends.org/games.htm/fish.php'><u>the Magnetic Scrolls Memorial</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Well done, Agent 10," said Sir Playfair Panchax, head of Mission HQ.
<b>Floyd</b> | "We knew you'd stop the Seven Deadly Fins. Good show! It's a shame they
<b>Floyd</b> | got away again. But now I suggest you take a vacation. You've earned
<b>Floyd</b> | it, old boy." You agreed with him, the last few months had been a real
<b>Floyd</b> | chore. Being an inter-dimensional espionage operative isn't a bad life
<b>Floyd</b> | apart from the pain of warping and the inconvenience of host-parasite
<b>Floyd</b> | relationships, but you need a spot of R and R every now and then, just
<b>Floyd</b> | to stay sane. So you went for the big one - warping into a goldfish for
<b>Floyd</b> | a whole month! The peace. The tranquility. And you're still on the
<b>Floyd</b> | payroll.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Someone's coming. Good, it must be time for food. SPLATTO. A hand as
<b>Floyd</b> | big as a bus drops something hard right on your head. Understandably
<b>Floyd</b> | dazed, you flip over and, through a swirl of ant eggs, spot what hit
<b>Floyd</b> | you: a tacky plastic castle. It looks like a rush job. Sir Playfair
<b>Floyd</b> | must be in trouble. And you thought you were on vacation...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Goldfish Bowl
<b>Floyd</b> | Swimming upside down is good fun, but difficult, even for someone as
<b>Floyd</b> | highly trained as yourself. It looks like the pondweed is dangling from
<b>Floyd</b> | the gravel above your head. And the ant eggs, wow! Upside down they
<b>Floyd</b> | look, so, so much like, well, like exactly the same as if you were the
<b>Floyd</b> | right way up actually. Anyway, there's no need to get carried away. Sir
<b>Floyd</b> | Playfair has a message for you in the castle if you're not mistaken and
<b>Floyd</b> | he hates agents who are late.

<TD><b>Ellison</b>  says, "[<A HREF="http://msmemorial.if-legends.org/games.htm/fish.php">LINK</A>] has some feelies and things. That Mission HQ pdf explains the basic premise of the game. the tl;dr version is that the game takes place in a world where people can warp into other creatures and control them for a while, so we'll be doing that a bunch. also, we're a spy. lastly, when we are warped into things, bright lights and loud sounds can force us out of our host's body."

<b>Floyd</b> | "Phffft! Phffft! Testing... Hello? Can you hear me? Agent 10?" You
<b>Floyd</b> | groan as Sir Playfair Panchax's voice rattles round your brain. "I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | sorry about this old chap," he continues, "I wouldn't disrupt your
<b>Floyd</b> | vacation unless it was necessary." He coughs. "It's bad news, I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | afraid; the Seven Deadly Fins again. Sabotage this time - on a planet
<b>Floyd</b> | full of fish! Beats me why they should pick on fish, but fish it is.
<b>Floyd</b> | They've stolen something important, a focus wheel I think, and
<b>Floyd</b> | dismantled it. We've got a fix on most places they've visited recently;
<b>Floyd</b> | you'll have to scout around and find the wheel. Your inter-dimensional
<b>Floyd</b> | warps will be ready in a few milliseconds. The back-room boys have some
<b>Floyd</b> | tricks up their sleeves if you get into trouble." The castle jolts and
<b>Floyd</b> | three warps and a glass box appear as Sir Playfair signs off. "Good

<b>Floyd</b> | "Well done, Agent 10," said Sir Playfair Panchax, head of Mission HQ.
<b>Floyd</b> | "We knew you'd stop the Seven Deadly Fins. Good show! It's a shame they
<b>Floyd</b> | got away again. But now I suggest you take a vacation. You've earned
<b>Floyd</b> | it, old boy." You agreed with him, the last few months had been a real
<b>Floyd</b> | chore. Being an inter-dimensional espionage operative isn't a bad life
<b>Floyd</b> | apart from the pain of warping and the inconvenience of host-parasite
<b>Floyd</b> | relationships, but you need a spot of R and R every now and then, just
<b>Floyd</b> | to stay sane. So you went for the big one - warping into a goldfish for
<b>Floyd</b> | a whole month! The peace. The tranquility. And you're still on the
<b>Floyd</b> | payroll.

<b>Floyd</b> | Someone's coming. Good, it must be time for food. SPLATTO. A hand as
<b>Floyd</b> | big as a bus drops something hard right on your head. Understandably
<b>Floyd</b> | dazed, you flip over and, through a swirl of ant eggs, spot what hit
<b>Floyd</b> | you: a tacky plastic castle. It looks like a rush job. Sir Playfair
<b>Floyd</b> | must be in trouble. And you thought you were on vacation...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Goldfish Bowl
<b>Floyd</b> | Swimming upside down is good fun, but difficult, even for someone as
<b>Floyd</b> | highly trained as yourself. It looks like the pondweed is dangling from
<b>Floyd</b> | the gravel above your head. And the ant eggs, wow! Upside down they
<b>Floyd</b> | look, so, so much like, well, like exactly the same as if you were the
<b>Floyd</b> | right way up actually. Anyway, there's no need to get carried away. Sir
<b>Floyd</b> | Playfair has a message for you in the castle if you're not mistaken and
<b>Floyd</b> | he hates agents who are late.

<b>Floyd</b> | Castle
<b>Floyd</b> | Inside, the castle is exactly what you expected - tacky and featureless
<b>Floyd</b> | with ant eggs near the top and gravel at the bottom. To anyone else,
<b>Floyd</b> | the colours sprayed randomly on the wall would just be colours sprayed
<b>Floyd</b> | randomly on the wall. To a daring inter-dimensional espionage operative
<b>Floyd</b> | like yourself, however, they are obviously used to focus communications
<b>Floyd</b> | across the dimensions. The only exit is out, back to the goldfish bowl.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Phffft! Phffft! Testing... Hello? Can you hear me? Agent 10?" You
<b>Floyd</b> | groan as Sir Playfair Panchax's voice rattles round your brain. "I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | sorry about this old chap," he continues, "I wouldn't disrupt your
<b>Floyd</b> | vacation unless it was necessary." He coughs. "It's bad news, I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | afraid; the Seven Deadly Fins again. Sabotage this time - on a planet
<b>Floyd</b> | full of fish! Beats me why they should pick on fish, but fish it is.
<b>Floyd</b> | They've stolen something important, a focus wheel I think, and
<b>Floyd</b> | dismantled it. We've got a fix on most places they've visited recently;
<b>Floyd</b> | you'll have to scout around and find the wheel. Your inter-dimensional
<b>Floyd</b> | warps will be ready in a few milliseconds. The back-room boys have some
<b>Floyd</b> | tricks up their sleeves if you get into trouble." The castle jolts and
<b>Floyd</b> | three warps and a glass box appear as Sir Playfair signs off. "Good

<b>Floyd</b> | "Right," he yells, "hold him down boys." The hippies close in. The

<b>Floyd</b> | and swallow you, one does. Well almost. It's actually in the ceiling
<b>Floyd</b> | but it'll definitely do. The hippies stop in their tracks and stare at
<b>Floyd</b> | the hole. "Cor baby," says one, taking a puff, "that's really free."
<b>Floyd</b> | You dive for it. Out of the corner of your eye you spot a goldfish
<b>Floyd</b> | approaching at phenomenal speed. Too late to avoid it now. BLAM! The
<b>Floyd</b> | grommet falls from your grasp and into the glass box. "Sorry about the

<b>Floyd</b> | worked out what the Fins are up to. I'll tell you what it is after we
<b>Floyd</b> | open a warp into Hydropolis, the fish planet's capital. Intriguing eh?"
<b>Floyd</b> | The castle jolts and a large warp appears in the wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, this is the story: the Fins have set up a meteorological

<b>Floyd</b> | scientists have devised a project to save their world but the Fins have
<b>Floyd</b> | sabotaged that too! You are to help them complete their project in the

<b>Floyd</b> | Inside, the castle is exactly what you expected - tacky and featureless

<b>Floyd</b> | Pub
<b>Floyd</b> | The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean
<b>Floyd</b> | bar and filthy customers. One of them, a sorry drunk leaning unsteadily
<b>Floyd</b> | against the bar, seems familiar to your host. Steve, the cool catfish
<b>Floyd</b> | from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
<b>Floyd</b> | brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
<b>Floyd</b> | customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
<b>Floyd</b> | "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
<b>Floyd</b> | or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east. An interesting
<b>Floyd</b> | looking cylinder is behind the bar.
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a stool here.
<b>Floyd</b> | As you arrive Ernest Chub greets you cheerfully.

<b>Floyd</b> | Dr. Roach could afford. Anyway, he managed to get a view of Hydropolis
<b>Floyd</b> | - not many places have even that. The room is decorated in a minimalist
<b>Floyd</b> | style but, as Dr. Roach would say if he weren't under your control, "I
<b>Floyd</b> | am a man of minimal needs." The only excesses he has allowed himself
<b>Floyd</b> | are a painting, a trendy black shelf, a switch to control the lights
<b>Floyd</b> | and, most important, a door to get out.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Well done, Agent 10," said Sir Playfair Panchax, head of Mission HQ.
<b>Floyd</b> | "We knew you'd stop the Seven Deadly Fins. Good show! It's a shame they
<b>Floyd</b> | got away again. But now I suggest you take a vacation. You've earned
<b>Floyd</b> | it, old boy." You agreed with him, the last few months had been a real
<b>Floyd</b> | chore. Being an inter-dimensional espionage operative isn't a bad life
<b>Floyd</b> | apart from the pain of warping and the inconvenience of host-parasite
<b>Floyd</b> | relationships, but you need a spot of R and R every now and then, just
<b>Floyd</b> | to stay sane. So you went for the big one - warping into a goldfish for
<b>Floyd</b> | a whole month! The peace. The tranquility. And you're still on the
<b>Floyd</b> | payroll.

<b>Floyd</b> | Goldfish Bowl
<b>Floyd</b> | Swimming upside down is good fun, but difficult, even for someone as

<b>Floyd</b> | look, so, so much like, well, like exactly the same as if you were the
<b>Floyd</b> | right way up actually. Anyway, there's no need to get carried away. Sir
<b>Floyd</b> | Playfair has a message for you in the castle if you're not mistaken and

<b>Floyd</b> | If things want learning in Hydropolis, then Opah University is where
<b>Floyd</b> | they get learned. The university disco to the north is in the middle of
<b>Floyd</b> | a bop-til-you-drop rag week stunt with schools of tired students
<b>Floyd</b> | swimming in and out to the heavy four-four beat. An expensive
<b>Floyd</b> | restaurant lies to the south. Have you made a reservation? No? Too bad.
<b>Floyd</b> | It's very popular. An impressive archway leads east into the university
<b>Floyd</b> | itself. You can return to Opah tube station by going west.
<b>Floyd</b> | A statue of the university founder is in the middle of the quad.

<b>Floyd</b> | got away again. But now I suggest you take a vacation. You've earned
<b>Floyd</b> | it, old boy." You agreed with him, the last few months had been a real
<b>Floyd</b> | chore. Being an inter-dimensional espionage operative isn't a bad life
<b>Floyd</b> | apart from the pain of warping and the inconvenience of host-parasite
<b>Floyd</b> | relationships, but you need a spot of R and R every now and then, just
<b>Floyd</b> | to stay sane. So you went for the big one - warping into a goldfish for
<b>Floyd</b> | a whole month! The peace. The tranquility. And you're still on the
<b>Floyd</b> | payroll.

<b>Floyd</b> | must be in trouble. And you thought you were on vacation...

<b>Floyd</b> | Goldfish Bowl
<b>Floyd</b> | Swimming upside down is good fun, but difficult, even for someone as

<b>Floyd</b> | the gravel above your head. And the ant eggs, wow! Upside down they
<b>Floyd</b> | look, so, so much like, well, like exactly the same as if you were the
<b>Floyd</b> | right way up actually. Anyway, there's no need to get carried away. Sir
<b>Floyd</b> | Playfair has a message for you in the castle if you're not mistaken and
<b>Floyd</b> | he hates agents who are late.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean

<b>Floyd</b> | The Hook, Line and Sinker is a good old-fashioned boozer, with a clean

<b>Floyd</b> | from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
<b>Floyd</b> | brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
<b>Floyd</b> | customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
<b>Floyd</b> | "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
<b>Floyd</b> | or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east. An interesting

<b>Floyd</b> | She takes you on a guided tour of the entire plant, filling your head
<b>Floyd</b> | with facts and figures about throughput, power consumption and blades.
<b>Floyd</b> | One thing that stuck in your mind was the interesting, but
<b>Floyd</b> | little-known, fact that Battersea is only the secondary power station
<b>Floyd</b> | for Hydropolis and is only used during peak demand and to power the
<b>Floyd</b> | underground system. After about half an hour, she returns you to the
<b>Floyd</b> | power station.
<b>Floyd</b> | Power Station
<b>Floyd</b> | The power station dwarfs almost anything you have ever seen. Guided

<b>Floyd</b> | from the second hand shop, is serving behind the bar. Or is it his twin
<b>Floyd</b> | brother? He sells masks, filled with gas from behind the bar, for the
<b>Floyd</b> | customers to sniff. Hence, the masks are known to the locals as
<b>Floyd</b> | "snifters" and the state of drunkeness as being "sniffed to the gills"
<b>Floyd</b> | or "completely finless". Exits lead north and east. An interesting

<b>Floyd</b> | When there was a lot of water around, students came up here to watch

<b>Floyd</b> | Store notes: The Stream Regulator has been stolen. This is serious. The
<b>Floyd</b> | Project will fail if we don't replace it. At present, we haven't
<b>Floyd</b> | located any replacement components. Anyone who can find them will be a
<b>Floyd</b> | hero. Here's a list of what's needed:
<b>Floyd</b> | Filter.
<b>Floyd</b> | Photon bridge - Dr. Salmon worked on this, he may know its whereabouts.
<b>Floyd</b> | Focus wheel - stolen days ago.
<b>Floyd</b> | Tuned Crystal - There's an untuned one in the museum but they won't let

<b>Floyd</b> | apart from the pain of warping and the inconvenience of host-parasite

<b>Floyd</b> | You did it! You saved Hydropolis! It's time for celebration, time to

<b>Floyd</b> | Roaches of this dimension. You return to Mission HQ, to a hero's

<b>Floyd</b> | missions. As a reward, we at the Department, are allowing you three
<b>Floyd</b> | month's vacation with a goldfish of your choice." He winks. "And we
<b>Floyd</b> | guarantee no interruptions this time." You are warped off to a
<b>Floyd</b> | spacious, warm aquarium with all the pondweed, ant eggs and gravel you
<b>Floyd</b> | could want. And of course, the most beautiful creature in all the
<b>Floyd</b> | dimensions to spend time with. After three months of this kind of
