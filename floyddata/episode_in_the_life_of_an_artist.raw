						The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each
						week at a pre-arranged time, a group of
						people meet online to cooperatively play
						a game of interactive fiction.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Episode in the Life of an Artist</em> written by Peter Eastman.
						It won Best Individual PC in the 2003 XYZZY Awards and took 11th place in the 9th Annual Interactive Fiction Competition (2003). 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting
						
						
							
								
								<a class="decorate" href='http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=gs12wgk1x3nl6ak4'>IFDB</a>.
							
						
					</span><br>
					<br>
					
						
					
					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing this game, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played this game, and think you might like to at some
						point, I do not recommend reading any further. Instead,
						you might want to return to the <a class="decorate" href=

<b>Floyd</b> | It takes a few wrong turns, but eventually I find my way back upstairs
<b>Floyd</b> | again.  The whole factory seems to be deserted.  Not a sign of anyone.
<b>Floyd</b> | The parking lot is completely empty.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As I stand waiting at the bus stop, I have the strangest feeling.
<b>Floyd</b> | It's like waking up from a trance, or leaving the auditorium at the
<b>Floyd</b> | end of a concert.  I know I've been somewhere strange, witnessed
<b>Floyd</b> | amazing things, but I'm not certain exactly what they were.  "States
<b>Floyd</b> | of dreamy melancholy, fits of aimless joy."  Was I the audience or the
<b>Floyd</b> | performer?  Did it really happen, or was it just a fantasy?  A witch's
<b>Floyd</b> | spell?  Am I the artist?  And if not, then who is?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I think I'll stop off at the mall on my way home.  I need an ice cream

<b>Floyd</b> | Dear Mom,
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks a lot for the cookies you sent.  They were really great.  I
<b>Floyd</b> | still say you make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My new job is going really well.  I never would have guessed that
<b>Floyd</b> | screwing caps onto toothpaste tubes could be so interesting.  My boss,
<b>Floyd</b> | Mr. Bucket, says I have a natural talent for it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I was really lucky to find a job so quickly.  A lot of the guys from
<b>Floyd</b> | Frobworks are still looking.  No one's sure what the new owners are
<b>Floyd</b> | planning to do with the building yet, but there's a rumor that they
<b>Floyd</b> | want to start a computer game company. Pretty weird, huh?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Anyway, thanks a lot.  I'll write again soon.  I love you a lot.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your son,
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Peter
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | P.S. Next time, could you send chocolate chip instead?

<b>Floyd</b> | It's time for breakfast!  I sit down to a delicious meal of fried eggs
<b>Floyd</b> | and start...  ummm...  excuse me.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm sorry, I just can't do this.  I can't stand eggs.  Even the smell
<b>Floyd</b> | of them makes me sick.  Couldn't we please change them to something
<b>Floyd</b> | else, like toast or cereal?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | OK, wait a minute.  I have an idea.  We'll keep the eggs, but as soon
<b>Floyd</b> | as they ask me to eat them, I'll realize the bus is coming.  So I
<b>Floyd</b> | won't have time to eat them, and I can just grab a pop-tart or
<b>Floyd</b> | something instead.  That way we can keep your whole "cooking the eggs"
<b>Floyd</b> | thing you were so proud of, but I won't have to eat them.  Would that
<b>Floyd</b> | be ok?

<b>Floyd</b> | Dear Mom,
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I have some very important news to tell you.  I have decided to get a
<b>Floyd</b> | job with a company that writes computer games.  I know this will come
<b>Floyd</b> | as a disappointment to you, since you've always wanted me to work in a
<b>Floyd</b> | factory like you and dad.  I know what you will say about family
<b>Floyd</b> | traditions and your great uncle Herbert and all that, but this is MY
<b>Floyd</b> | life, damn it.  I'm sick of wasting my life putting stupid pieces of
<b>Floyd</b> | plastic together day after day after day.  It's time I did something
<b>Floyd</b> | that I care about, for a change.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And while I'm at it, what's up with the cookies?  How many times have
<b>Floyd</b> | I told you that I can't stand oatmeal raisin cookies?  Why do you
<b>Floyd</b> | insist on doing this to me?  Are you trying to prove something, or can
<b>Floyd</b> | you simply not believe I could really feel differently from you about
<b>Floyd</b> | anything in the world?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Dear Mom,
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thank you for the cookies you sent.  I guess you forgot that I don't
<b>Floyd</b> | eat oatmeal raisin cookies, but I really appreciate the thought.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I have some wonderful news for you.  I've decided to get a job with a
<b>Floyd</b> | company that writes computer games.  I know it's a bit different from
<b>Floyd</b> | what you've always imagined for me.  But this is a great opportunity,
<b>Floyd</b> | and I think I could be really good at it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I hope you won't be too disappointed by this.  I just don't want to
<b>Floyd</b> | keep wasting my life working at an assembly line.  Not that there's
<b>Floyd</b> | anything wrong with working on an assembly line.  I know you and dad
<b>Floyd</b> | have done it all your lives, and you really like it.  It's just that I
<b>Floyd</b> | don't want to keep wasting my life
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (sigh)
