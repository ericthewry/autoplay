					<span class="fontish smaller">Like ClubFloyd, the idea behind NightFloyd is that a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.<br><br>Unlike ClubFloyd, NightFloyd often takes on significantly larger works of interactive fiction, knowing going in that each one will take multiple sessions (but not always, as you'll see in this transcript). NightFloyd is also a bit more informal than ClubFloyd in that it's only announced on the ifMUD #clubfloyd bulletin board, and the time shifts around to meet player's schedules far more than ClubFloyd does. NightFloyd is organized by genericgeekgirl, aka Adri.<br>

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An old resolution: <span class="floydstyle em">no dealings with the Three Rebeccas.</span> But
<b>Floyd</b> | clade-mates must be civil, and civility made you careless. More
<b>Floyd</b> | importantly, Jave was going to be there: Jave, who you haven't managed
<b>Floyd</b> | to see in close on a year, as though the ways were twisting against
<b>Floyd</b> | you. And they don't have any <span class="floydstyle em">good</span> reasons to want to fuck you
<b>Floyd</b> | over, so you should really give them the benefit of the doubt, right?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But as you cross the threshold of the tangle, every sense screams
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">trap</span>. Of fucking course.

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle header">Invisible Parties</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | An Interdimensional Romance by Sam Kabo Ashwell
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 3 / Serial number 140807 / Inform 7 build 6L02 (I6/v6.33 lib
<b>Floyd</b> | 6/12N)
<b>Floyd</b> | Credits, help, further information: see ABOUT.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">None Know The Hour</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | Feels like the apartments of a well-off academic couple who entertain
<b>Floyd</b> | a lot. Lots of one-of-a-kind furniture in nice old wood, very full
<b>Floyd</b> | bookcases, art conspicuously esoteric and ethnic. Would feel kind of
<b>Floyd</b> | crowded if it wasn't so unnaturally tidy. More, similar rooms
<b>Floyd</b> | sprawling out through odd-angled spaces.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It was themed as a maybe-the-apocalypse party - a small joke on the
<b>Floyd</b> | difficulty of scheduling social events in a multiverse. There's a
<b>Floyd</b> | mushroom-cloud cake (already partially eaten), a planet-shaped
<b>Floyd</b> | piñata,
<b>Floyd</b> | and a glittery banner declaring HAPPY END OF DAYS. A few of the guests
<b>Floyd</b> | are costumed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Becky Baumgartner is seated - enthroned, really, like a heavy-handed
<b>Floyd</b> | neoclassical allegory - with a snow leopard draped at her feet. She
<b>Floyd</b> | cocks her chin up at your approach.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Orient yourself. Picture the woven ways as ground underfoot, and
<b>Floyd</b> | they'll become walkable. The tangle extends to the north, south, east
<b>Floyd</b> | and west. <span class="floydstyle em">[You can turn off exit notifications with EXITS OFF, or</span>

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">[Invisible Parties was made for ShuffleComp in April/May 2014, an</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">event that randomly assigned songs to authors to inspire games. It was</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">originally published under the pseudonym Psychopup. The work was very</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">loosely inspired by </span>Symphony 10: Could This Really Be The End<span class="floydstyle em"></span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">by Emily Wells, from the album </span>The Symphonies: Dreams Memories &
<b>Floyd</b> | Parties<span class="floydstyle em">; the song was suggested by Jennifer Earl. (Actually, this</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">was sort of a cop-out, because I was already familiar with the song,</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">owned the album, and had seen the artist play live.)</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Thanks are due to Matt Weiner and Doug Orleans for first-round</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">testing, to Neil Butters, Jacqueline Lott, Emily Short and Caleb</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Wilson for second-round testing, and to Jason Dyer, Dan Shiovitz and</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Carl Muckenhoupt for brainstorming post-comp improvements.</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Finally,  thanks to Bedlam Coffee, Drip City Coffee Company,</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Fremont Coffee Company, the Red Door, the Cyclops Café & Lounge, and</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Anna Armstrong; because I would never get a writing project finished</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">if I did it all at home.</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Complaints, bug reports, comments to magadog@gmail.com . HELP may</span>

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With the warrior gift, you win fights. People often describe it as
<b>Floyd</b> | innate skill, and that's partly it, but it's something more than that;
<b>Floyd</b> | it also, somehow, shields you from the kinds of bad luck that get even
<b>Floyd</b> | the strong and experienced killed. It is not something to be relied
<b>Floyd</b> | upon, given that it makes you neither bulletproof nor inexhaustible,
<b>Floyd</b> | but it's one hell of an edge.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For some, the talent manifests in sublime grace, a whirl of dancer's
<b>Floyd</b> | rhythms and brush-stroke arcs. It does not work that way for you.
<b>Floyd</b> | You're more about short stabbing motions, nasty little twists and
<b>Floyd</b> | locks, low defensive stances, staying in cover, controlled fire. Looks

<b>Floyd</b> | Worlds change wayfarers to a certain extent, and you're used to that.
<b>Floyd</b> | But a tangle is a messy superposition of many worlds, so it's liable

<b>Floyd</b> | A politely-deployed tangle will often have a sort of foyer, a

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One of the most common gifts, if only because those without it tend to
<b>Floyd</b> | die off fast. A forager can find food and water if there's any to be
<b>Floyd</b> | found. You know, somehow, which berries are best left uneaten, which
<b>Floyd</b> | meat is full of hookworm, which water is a cholera vector.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The forager gift is often given as the reason why so many of the Walk
<b>Floyd</b> | are ravening foodies. You're doubtful of the correlation, yourself:
<b>Floyd</b> | travel's reason enough. But a professional-quality meal <span class="floydstyle em">does</span>

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's called <span class="floydstyle em">trickster</span> by some, and the stories that feature
<b>Floyd</b> | it usually depict someone with a pathological need to start shit, who
<b>Floyd</b> | glories in shit-starting for its own sake, even at vast personal cost.
<b>Floyd</b> | Yeah, there are people like that all over, and the ones who have the
<b>Floyd</b> | gift are fucking <span class="floydstyle em">awful</span>. But you're not, by inclination,
<b>Floyd</b> | someone who <span class="floydstyle em">lives</span> to make trouble. Not since you were younger
<b>Floyd</b> | and more confused, anyway. Nor do you create trouble by accident, at
<b>Floyd</b> | least not any more than the average person. What the gift
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">does</span> is to make the trouble you start <span class="floydstyle em">highly</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">effective</span>; if any potential exists for a riot or a fist-fight or
<b>Floyd</b> | a shouting-match, you can pretty much ensure it'll be an <span class="floydstyle em">epic</span>

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle input">&gt; X CRITIC</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Some gifts are of, well, fairly marginal utility. You met a guy once
<b>Floyd</b> | whose only talent, other than wayfinding itself, was juggling. He
<b>Floyd</b> | could juggle pretty much anything he could lift one-handed, mind you,
<b>Floyd</b> | and had thought of several unexpected applications, but it didn't go
<b>Floyd</b> | all that far.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Textual criticism is a good bit more useful, because - like most gifts
<b>Floyd</b> | - it's truly cross-cultural, which means that you can read, say, a
<b>Floyd</b> | pamplet of pornographic 18th-century French political satire, or an
<b>Floyd</b> | oral history of land rights among indigenous Tasmanians, or a zine
<b>Floyd</b> | circulated among otaku in 1980s NorCal high schools, and you will
<b>Floyd</b> | actually <span class="floydstyle em">grasp</span> all the layers of meaning.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Apart from making grad school embarrassingly easy, it's very useful
<b>Floyd</b> | for grappling with the otherwise-incomprehensible peoples that
<b>Floyd</b> | populate odd corners of the ways and worlds - as long as they're
<b>Floyd</b> | literate, or willing to tell you stories.

<b>Floyd</b> | The tangle extends to the inside to Sun-sleeps-in-the-rock.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A memory:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Two-thirds of the way along Mirror Branch, the only time that an easy
<b>Floyd</b> | job got a little twitchy. Along the river there was, unexpectedly, a
<b>Floyd</b> | stockade, set up by a Romani band, out of Upside via Kosovo. They were
<b>Floyd</b> | well-armed, and had one or two single-gifted among them; it was not
<b>Floyd</b> | clear whether they were set up as bandits, or toll-collectors, or were
<b>Floyd</b> | simply protecting their settlement. They bristled; accustomed to
<b>Floyd</b> | persecution, they assumed trade along this river would be followed by
<b>Floyd</b> | Mission, and if they were wrong it was only through happy accident.
<b>Floyd</b> | You still don't really have any idea about how their humour
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">worked</span> - you had the vague sense that dark humour was part of
<b>Floyd</b> | everything, something in the vein of Soviet political jokes, and that
<b>Floyd</b> | there was a subtle distinction between the kinds of joke told by women
<b>Floyd</b> | and men, but really all that you <span class="floydstyle em">knew</span> was that there was a
<b>Floyd</b> | vast, vast amount of vital meaning that was shooting back and forth
<b>Floyd</b> | over your head.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And Jave just sort of waded into all this - look, the first time you
<b>Floyd</b> | really remember her, remember her as a distinct person rather than a
<b>Floyd</b> | template Mission-vet, is when she burst out in full-bellied laughs at
<b>Floyd</b> | an aside from the headman.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | They didn't suddenly become her bosom friends. The scene did not end
<b>Floyd</b> | with a guitar sing-along over potent drinks, worse luck. They knew
<b>Floyd</b> | that something was going on with her, and you're not completely sure
<b>Floyd</b> | it changed the outcome. But they had started thinking of her (and only
<b>Floyd</b> | her) as a person rather than a problem. She waved when you left, and
<b>Floyd</b> | some of them waved back.

<b>Floyd</b> | A high-ceilinged ballroom, decorated in full-on shameless rococo with
<b>Floyd</b> | fussy strapwork and gold-enameled nymphs and all the rest of it. A

<b>Floyd</b> | about, but instead you're stuck down here getting handed off from one
<b>Floyd</b> | twirling ninny to the next.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There's something a little off about one of the nymphs.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The tangle extends to the north to The Raftered Hall, south to

<b>Floyd</b> | A sky perfectly clear, moonless, cream-thick with stars. Air agreeably
<b>Floyd</b> | cool, suggesting a warm day to come. Below, water so clear and shallow

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This is not a way you have any feel for at all - walking is in your

<b>Floyd</b> | unlike the Great Open Sea, you love this place as a strangeway, a road

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And each will lead to another staircase, and another, a door, a

<b>Floyd</b> | Slickrock hillside, orange-red, a hot sun low in a cloudless sky, a
<b>Floyd</b> | hard dry heat. Far downhill, the rock gives way to thornveldt, the
<b>Floyd</b> | plain punctuated by distant outcrops.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Beneath a lone, broad-spreading shade-tree, people kick back on
<b>Floyd</b> | boulders and blankets and camp-chairs. There are meaty things sizzling
<b>Floyd</b> | over a fire, a couple of coolers.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And outwards, across the sun-baked rock, you can sense the Barren Way
<b>Floyd</b> | beckoning.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The tangle extends to the north, east to The Pleasant Month of May,
<b>Floyd</b> | west to No Place To Rest Your Head and Outside to Barren Way.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You stand up in what you hope is a dramatic fashion, and toss back

<b>Floyd</b> | Very casually, as if there is nothing strange about the situation at

<b>Floyd</b> | Most obviously it's concerned with escapism, exile, and with the Wood.
<b>Floyd</b> | The wood touches every part of Ombrosa, yet it is not Ombrosa. Cosimo
<b>Floyd</b> | is a sort of fairy, an inhabitant of a land adjacent but fundamentally
<b>Floyd</b> | separate; thus able to retain a certain attitude of youth. The bargain
<b>Floyd</b> | he makes is an end in itself, not a temporary sojourn in the
<b>Floyd</b> | wilderness; unlike Mowgli or Crusoe, he is not destined, nor is he
<b>Floyd</b> | willing, to return to an ordained place in civilised society - about
<b>Floyd</b> | which Calvino, unlike Defoe or Kipling, is generally pessimistic, yet
<b>Floyd</b> | Cosimo's exile is in some limited senses a triumph, not a reduction.
<b>Floyd</b> | It's a book tied to the age of profound disappointment that follows an
<b>Floyd</b> | age of idealism, particularly intellectual idealism.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You could expand at length upon this to unpack the significance to
<b>Floyd</b> | post-WW2 Italy, to mid-C20th socialism, to the relationship between
<b>Floyd</b> | sainted hermit and ivory-tower intellectual, to clade

<b>Floyd</b> | You're on a village green: in England, or something very close to it.
<b>Floyd</b> | It's a flawless day in late spring, a blue sky dappled with lazy white
<b>Floyd</b> | clouds, air clean, crisp and just on the pleasant side of cool. Fresh
<b>Floyd</b> | green all over the trees, including the big dancing-lime spreading its
<b>Floyd</b> | shade over the green's heart. And evidently someone decided that the
<b>Floyd</b> | only thing that could possibly improve this was an accordion. You're
<b>Floyd</b> | amidst a rustic and jubilant crowd, dancing with more enthusiasm than
<b>Floyd</b> | choreography.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And there, at the edges of the green, the mouth of a hollow way. A way
<b>Floyd</b> | out.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You recognise one of the scraps of cloth tied around the tree's lower

<b>Floyd</b> | popping open every bottle in sequence, pouring just a few drops:
<b>Floyd</b> | sniff, sip, rinse and spit. (If anyone objects to your indecorous use
<b>Floyd</b> | of a spare bus tray as a spitoon, they can go fuck themselves.) The
<b>Floyd</b> | first three taste of... nothing you've had before, definitely acquired
<b>Floyd</b> | tastes. The fourth is a sickly fake-hazelnut thing. You wrinkle your
<b>Floyd</b> | nose and spit with gusto.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Before you've moved more than three feet down the rows, your tastebuds

<b>Floyd</b> | rain, and had turned from a clear sheet of water a stone's throw broad
<b>Floyd</b> | to a turbid chocolate torrent, full of broken-off trees. It was still
<b>Floyd</b> | raining. A couple of grunts had taken noncritical wounds in a
<b>Floyd</b> | skirmish, but more to the point, the antifungals supplied by command
<b>Floyd</b> | were about as effective as talcum powder, so you were all itching

<b>Floyd</b> | until the water went down, cheek-by-jowl with a bunch of exhausted,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Jave was just about the only reason why the group didn't disintegrate

<b>Floyd</b> | didn't lose her temper when a brawl broke out among the grunts, and
