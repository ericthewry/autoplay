The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>A Change in the Weather</i>, written by Andrew&nbsp;Plotkin.  <i>A Change in the Weather</i> was originally released as part of the IF Competition, where it took first place. You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/235"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.</br>

So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | Edge Of Meadow
<b>Floyd</b> | The grasses are fragrant under the sunshine of a late, late summer

<b>Floyd</b> | Edge Of Meadow
<b>Floyd</b> | The grasses are fragrant under the sunshine of a late, late summer

<b>Floyd</b> | scrubby hillside stretches upward.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The shouts of the volleyball players and the boom-box thump are

<b>Floyd</b> | Rocky Outlook
<b>Floyd</b> | A wide angular tongue juts out from the hillside. The park stretches
<b>Floyd</b> | off to the north and west, a vast expanse of bright meadowland, patched
<b>Floyd</b> | with dark woods and stitched with streams that glitter in the sunlight.
<b>Floyd</b> | In the distance, a lake reflects white fire from the setting sun.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | A trail leads southwest down the hill, towards the bridge. From where

<b>Floyd</b> | You are high on the hill; it rolls downward and off to the west. Beyond

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A boulder is lying at the base of the hilltop, prised up out of the

<b>Floyd</b> | Edge Of Meadow
<b>Floyd</b> | The grasses are fragrant under the sunshine of a late, late summer

<b>Floyd</b> | The shouts of the volleyball players and the boom-box thump are

<b>Floyd</b> | Rocky Outlook
<b>Floyd</b> | A wide angular tongue juts out from the hillside. The park stretches

<b>Floyd</b> | off to the north and west, a vast expanse of bright meadowland, patched
<b>Floyd</b> | with dark woods and stitched with streams that glitter in the sunlight.
<b>Floyd</b> | In the distance, a lake reflects white fire from the setting sun.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A trail leads southwest down the hill, towards the bridge. From where
<b>Floyd</b> | you stand, it turns southeast and continues upward, deeply cut into the

<b>Floyd</b> | hillside. A narrower trail leads more steeply up to the east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Someone has dug a trench here, from the path out over the bank.
<b>Floyd</b> | Abandoned in the mud near it is a spade. You figure someone was using
<b>Floyd</b> | the spade to dig the trench, and you can also figure why he stopped;
<b>Floyd</b> | the shaft is broken off about two feet up from the blade. The handle

<b>Floyd</b> | end is nowhere in sight.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The sun is lazily approaching the horizon.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The picnic is going full blast, which is exactly why you've wandered

<b>Floyd</b> | away from it. It's not that you don't like your new companions; it's
<b>Floyd</b> | just that after weeks of spending each day around them, a noisy weekend
<b>Floyd</b> | cook-out isn't the way to relax. Some exploration -- on your own -- is
<b>Floyd</b> | an appealing thought.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | None of them noticed you drifting away, anyhow.

<b>Floyd</b> | Edge Of Meadow
<b>Floyd</b> | The grasses are fragrant under the sunshine of a late, late summer
<b>Floyd</b> | afternoon. A stream chatters by at your feet, and a weathered old
<b>Floyd</b> | wooden bridge stretches across it to the east. Beyond the stream, a

<b>Floyd</b> | scrubby hillside stretches upward.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The shouts of the volleyball players and the boom-box thump are
<b>Floyd</b> | pleasantly far off to the west.

<b>Floyd</b> | A slope descends to the noisy stream to the west. The old wooden bridge

<b>Floyd</b> | two usable trails lead up around it, to the south and the northeast.

<b>Floyd</b> | Wildflowers
<b>Floyd</b> | Elsewhere in the park, flowers lie in hollows and peek out from under

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Beyond a slight rise to the west, the ground drops precipitously to the

<b>Floyd</b> | Rocky Outlook
<b>Floyd</b> | A wide angular tongue juts out from the hillside. The park stretches
<b>Floyd</b> | off to the north and west, a vast expanse of bright meadowland, patched
<b>Floyd</b> | with dark woods and stitched with streams that glitter in the sunlight.

<b>Floyd</b> | In the distance, a lake reflects white fire from the setting sun.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A trail leads southwest down the hill, towards the bridge. From where
<b>Floyd</b> | you stand, it turns southeast and continues upward, deeply cut into the
<b>Floyd</b> | hillside. A narrower trail leads more steeply up to the east.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Someone has dug a trench here, from the path out over the bank.
<b>Floyd</b> | Abandoned in the mud near it is a spade. You figure someone was using
<b>Floyd</b> | the spade to dig the trench, and you can also figure why he stopped;
<b>Floyd</b> | the shaft is broken off about two feet up from the blade. The handle
<b>Floyd</b> | end is nowhere in sight.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Edge Of Meadow
<b>Floyd</b> | The grasses are fragrant under the sunshine of a late, late summer
<b>Floyd</b> | afternoon. A stream chatters by at your feet, and a weathered old
<b>Floyd</b> | wooden bridge stretches across it to the east. Beyond the stream, a
<b>Floyd</b> | scrubby hillside stretches upward.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The shouts of the volleyball players and the boom-box thump are
<b>Floyd</b> | pleasantly far off to the west.

<b>Floyd</b> | Stream Bank

<b>Floyd</b> | A slope descends to the noisy stream to the west. The old wooden bridge
<b>Floyd</b> | which spans it leans comfortably against the bank at your feet. To the
<b>Floyd</b> | east rises the flank of the hill, shining in the afternoon sunlight;
<b>Floyd</b> | two usable trails lead up around it, to the south and the northeast.

<b>Floyd</b> | Wildflowers

<b>Floyd</b> | Elsewhere in the park, flowers lie in hollows and peek out from under
<b>Floyd</b> | the brush. Here you have found a profusion of them. Sprays of white and
<b>Floyd</b> | blue lie everywhere; the vines ripple yellow.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Beyond a slight rise to the west, the ground drops precipitously to the
<b>Floyd</b> | stream. A trail leads northward towards the bridge; another heads

<b>Floyd</b> | steeply up to the east, and a third curves around the hill to the
<b>Floyd</b> | southeast.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A glint in a nearby bush looks more metallic than floral.

<b>Floyd</b> | Rocky Outlook
<b>Floyd</b> | A wide angular tongue juts out from the hillside. The park stretches

<b>Floyd</b> | off to the north and west, a vast expanse of bright meadowland, patched
<b>Floyd</b> | with dark woods and stitched with streams that glitter in the sunlight.
<b>Floyd</b> | In the distance, a lake reflects orange fire from the setting sun.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A trail leads southwest down the hill, towards the bridge. From where
<b>Floyd</b> | you stand, it turns southeast and continues upward, deeply cut into the

<b>Floyd</b> | hillside. A narrower trail leads more steeply up to the east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Someone has dug a trench here, from the path out over the bank.
<b>Floyd</b> | Abandoned in the mud near it is a spade. You figure someone was using
<b>Floyd</b> | the spade to dig the trench, and you can also figure why he stopped;
<b>Floyd</b> | the shaft is broken off about two feet up from the blade. The handle

<b>Floyd</b> | end is nowhere in sight.

<b>Floyd</b> | Steep Face
<b>Floyd</b> | You're standing on a ledge, on a rather steep, overgrown hillface.
<b>Floyd</b> | Greenery hides the stream below and the hilltop above, but the meadows

<b>Floyd</b> | and sky beyond sweep away endlessly to the west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Trails angle down to the northwest and southwest. Another crosses the
<b>Floyd</b> | hill to the south, but a chunk is washed out, too wide to jump across.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A bush is growing out of a crack in the hillside, to the south. It's

<b>Floyd</b> | right in the gap in the southern path. You could probably use it to get
<b>Floyd</b> | across. (One of those little coincidences that makes your life a little
<b>Floyd</b> | nicer.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Among the hill's brush and scraggly trees, the tree that stands here
<b>Floyd</b> | stands alone. You might be able to get your arms around it, and you

<b>Floyd</b> | might not; it must reach nearly as high as the hilltop itself.

<b>Floyd</b> | You're standing on a ledge, on a rather steep, overgrown hillface. Mist
<b>Floyd</b> | hides the stream below and the hilltop above, but the meadows and
<b>Floyd</b> | clouds beyond sweep away into the west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Trails angle down to the northwest and southwest. Another crosses the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The bush seems to have been utterly demolished by the falling boulder.
<b>Floyd</b> | Nothing is left in the crack but a couple of splinters.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Among the hill's brush and scraggly trees, the tree that stands here
<b>Floyd</b> | stands alone. You might be able to get your arms around it, and you

<b>Floyd</b> | might not; it must reach nearly as high as the hilltop itself.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Runoff water is trickling down the hill, concentrated here by some
<b>Floyd</b> | twist of geography. It puddles on the ledge, then begins pouring down
<b>Floyd</b> | the path to the northwest.

<b>Floyd</b> | The fox appears under a nearby bush.
