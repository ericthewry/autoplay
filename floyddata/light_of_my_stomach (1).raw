The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Speed IF Jacket 4</i>, written by Various Authors.  Speed IF Jacket 4 was organized by Sam Ashwell, and the games were released the same day as this ClubFloyd session.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Speed-IF#2011'><u>the ifWiki</u></A> (which doesn't have a page for this Speed as of the time of posting the transcript because the games are <I>just that new</I>, but hopefully there will be a page by the time you click on that link!).</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b><I>ANOTHER</I> WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> A lot (most!) of the transcripts contained on this site are, shall we say, family-friendly.

<b>Floyd</b> | You smile an easy, confident smile. "Professor Zzar! I might have

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yes, Captain Galactic, it is I." For a cornered villain, destined for

<b>Floyd</b> | seems awfully smug. What's his game this time?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a deep thrumming from the plastic orb in the Professor's
<b>Floyd</b> | hand, and a hypnotic, throbbing light. Evil technology! Your ray slips

<b>Floyd</b> | "You're entering a Level IX Subconscious Psychic Comatose Preservation

<b>Floyd</b> | this dream-chamber is none other than Science Station Alpha, on the
<b>Floyd</b> | surface of a distant moon of the Visceron System. Here is where you
<b>Floyd</b> | and the Professor first crossed rays, and where his studies of
<b>Floyd</b> | sleep-states led him to develop the "perfect" preservative level of
<b>Floyd</b> | slumber: the Level IX Subconscious Psychic Comatose Preservation
<b>Floyd</b> | State.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Professor Zzar believes that this state is inescapable ... and he's
<b>Floyd</b> | nearly right ... but here is also where the only known exception was
<b>Floyd</b> | proven, and recorded in the highly secret Omega Document! Now, if only
<b>Floyd</b> | you can locate it ...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see Zippy, George, Abelard, Ickstein, Chunky, and the Omega
<b>Floyd</b> | Document here.

<b>Floyd</b> | Outside the tank, the great door opens in a fanfare of rotating yellow

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your eyes rest on the cover of Captain Galactic and the Slave Wenches

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Gah. You messed up the sheets again. Time to hide them in the hamper

<b>Floyd</b> | through your lizard brain, air, food, rest, smoochies, video games.
<b>Floyd</b> | After who knows how long you open your eyes. You're in some kind of
<b>Floyd</b> | interrogation room, small, cramped. The stone carvings on the
<b>Floyd</b> | moss-covered walls make this look like a lazily designed secret room
<b>Floyd</b> | from a videogame. With you in the room is a gorilla in a suit, who
<b>Floyd</b> | looks a bit like Ron Perlman. Only this gorilla has rocket launchers
<b>Floyd</b> | for arms. You close your eyes. "Oh no" you think to yourself, "not
<b>Floyd</b> | again."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And then you remember. The secret mission, from the new boss, who does
<b>Floyd</b> | look something like Michael Gambon: "Somewhere in the Brazilian
<b>Floyd</b> | jungle, there is a new mastermind at work. We know very little, only
<b>Floyd</b> | that he killed our best agent, Bonathan Jlask. And that he's hidden in
<b>Floyd</b> | some secret temple. Well, we've heard you know how to find such
<b>Floyd</b> | places. And how to get into them." You told him you're retired. "No"
<b>Floyd</b> | he said, firmly. "People like you never are." You were about to
<b>Floyd</b> | respond, but his secretary, the spitting image of Kirsten Dunst,
<b>Floyd</b> | already handed you the tickets.
<b>Floyd</b> | Flash forward. The gorilla is looking at you. "What were you doing
<b>Floyd</b> | here?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 1) "What do you mean? I am a botanist. I was looking for a special
<b>Floyd</b> | plant."

<b>Floyd</b> | eaten by a grue so I switched on my lamp. Only it didn't have any
<b>Floyd</b> | batteries. And my box full of batteries was guarded by a snake. I
<b>Floyd</b> | found a toy mouse to distract it, so I got my batteries. They were the
<b>Floyd</b> | wrong size. But with them, I could switch on the venilator for
<b>Floyd</b> | Professor Bunglay, who in turn gave me his electric shaver, which did

<b>Floyd</b> | through your lizard brain, air, food, rest, smoochies, video games.
<b>Floyd</b> | After who knows how long you open your eyes. You're in some kind of
<b>Floyd</b> | interrogation room, small, cramped. The stone carvings on the
<b>Floyd</b> | moss-covered walls make this look like a lazily designed secret room
<b>Floyd</b> | from a videogame. With you in the room is a gorilla in a suit, who
<b>Floyd</b> | looks a bit like Ron Perlman. Only this gorilla has rocket launchers
<b>Floyd</b> | for arms. You close your eyes. "Oh no" you think to yourself, "not
<b>Floyd</b> | again."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And then you remember. The secret mission, from the new boss, who does
<b>Floyd</b> | look something like Michael Gambon: "Somewhere in the Brazilian
<b>Floyd</b> | jungle, there is a new mastermind at work. We know very little, only
<b>Floyd</b> | that he killed our best agent, Bonathan Jlask. And that he's hidden in
<b>Floyd</b> | some secret temple. Well, we've heard you know how to find such
<b>Floyd</b> | places. And how to get into them." You told him you're retired. "No"
<b>Floyd</b> | he said, firmly. "People like you never are." You were about to
<b>Floyd</b> | respond, but his secretary, the spitting image of Kirsten Dunst,
<b>Floyd</b> | already handed you the tickets.
<b>Floyd</b> | Flash forward. The gorilla is looking at you. "What were you doing
<b>Floyd</b> | here?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 1) "What do you mean? I am a botanist. I was looking for a special
<b>Floyd</b> | plant."
<b>Floyd</b> | 2) "I am a secret agent for the world government!"

<b>Floyd</b> | native to western South America. The plant plays a significant role in
<b>Floyd</b> | traditional Andean culture. Coca is best known throughout the world
<b>Floyd</b> | because of its alkaloids, which include cocaine, a powerful stimulant.
<b>Floyd</b> | The plant resembles a blackthorn bush, and grows to a height of 2-3 m
<b>Floyd</b> | (7-10 ft). The branches are straight, and the leaves, which have a
<b>Floyd</b> | green tint, are thin, opaque, oval, and taper at the extremities. A
<b>Floyd</b> | marked characteristic of the leaf is an areolated portion bounded by
<b>Floyd</b> | two longitudinal curved lines, one line on each side of the midrib,
<b>Floyd</b> | and more conspicuous on the under face of the leaf.
<b>Floyd</b> | The flowers are small, and disposed in little clusters on short
<b>Floyd</b> | stalks; the corolla is composed of five yellowish-white petals, the
<b>Floyd</b> | anthers are heart-shaped, and the pistil consists of three carpels
<b>Floyd</b> | united to form a three-chambered ovary. The flowers mature into red
<b>Floyd</b> | berries.
<b>Floyd</b> | The leaves are sometimes eaten by the larvae of the moth Eloria
<b>Floyd</b> | noyesi.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Species and classification
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There are twelve main species and varieties. Two subspecies,
<b>Floyd</b> | Erythroxylum coca var. coca and Erythroxylum coca var. ipadu, are
<b>Floyd</b> | almost indistinguishable phenotypically; a related high
<b>Floyd</b> | cocaine-bearing species has two subspecies, Erythroxylum
<b>Floyd</b> | novogranatense var. novogranatense and Erythroxylum novogranatense
<b>Floyd</b> | var. truxillense that are phenotypically similar, but morphologically
<b>Floyd</b> | distinguishable. Under the older Cronquist system of classifying
<b>Floyd</b> | flowering plants, this was placed in an order Linales; more modern
<b>Floyd</b> | systems place it in the order Malpighiales.
<b>Floyd</b> | Cultivation
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Coca tree in Colombia
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Coca is traditionally cultivated in the lower altitudes of the eastern
<b>Floyd</b> | slopes of the Andes (the Yungas), or the highlands depending on the
<b>Floyd</b> | species grown. Since ancient times, its leaves have been an important
<b>Floyd</b> | trade commodity between the lowlands where it is grown and the higher
<b>Floyd</b> | altitudes where it is widely consumed by the Andean peoples of Peru,
<b>Floyd</b> | Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia and northwestern Argentina.

<b>Floyd</b> | Release 1 / Serial number 110415 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib
<b>Floyd</b> | 6/12N)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Waterfront
<b>Floyd</b> | In terms of mere geography, Ruritania is landlocked. Liminally it's a
<b>Floyd</b> | lot more complicated. On slow days, this is the bank of the Svonat, a
<b>Floyd</b> | minor river that for maybe sixty kilometres traces the Slovakian
<b>Floyd</b> | border, only distinguished by rather sparse settlement for such a
<b>Floyd</b> | fertile valley.Today it's the verge of a mangrove swamp, water the
<b>Floyd</b> | colour of strong tea lapping gently against a barnacle-encrusted
<b>Floyd</b> | jetty, and far off through the trees the suggestion of blazing light
<b>Floyd</b> | on a foreign sea. (You haven't seen this one before.) A crab darts
<b>Floyd</b> | across a salt-crusted log; the air is warm, with a strong taste of
<b>Floyd</b> | salt, anchovies and rotting mud.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Margin Cafe looks no more weatherbeaten than usual, and the
<b>Floyd</b> | prospect of cooler air is enticing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A mudlark is perusing low-hanging branches for lootable fruits.

<b>Floyd</b> |  "It's urban fantasy without the "urban"." -- Carolyn VanEseltine

<b>Floyd</b> |  "More of an extended joke than a game. Not a particularly funny joke
<b>Floyd</b> | either."  -- Tanga
<b>Floyd</b> |  "The game's triumph was not just making me care about the love
<b>Floyd</b> | interest, but also making me understand why I had to let them go."  --
<b>Floyd</b> | C.E.J. Pacian
<b>Floyd</b> |  "I've read more comprehensible prose out of a James Joyce book dunked

<b>Floyd</b> |  "One item in particular has a really impressive number of different

<b>Floyd</b> | format for Speed-IF Jacket: authors submit a number of short phrases
<b>Floyd</b> | or sentences (like review excerpts from a book jacket), and then the
<b>Floyd</b> | blurbs are used as prompts to inspire a game.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The prompts I received made me blink and laugh.  Plainly, a lot of
<b>Floyd</b> | creativity went into this!  Despite my best intentions, I couldn't fit
<b>Floyd</b> | a bunch of these in, so here's my sorted list of quotes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Included:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Much time is wasted in irrelevant flirting between parser and PC.
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;GET ROOM, guys." -- Sam Kabo Ashwell
<b>Floyd</b> | "Not, surprisingly, an unreliable narrator game."  -- Colin Sandel
<b>Floyd</b> | "The writer is a strange, strange, strange individual."  -- Tanga
<b>Floyd</b> | "I'll never look at frozen peas the same way again."  -- C.E.J. Pacian
<b>Floyd</b> | "It's painfully obvious that the entire game was written solely to set
<b>Floyd</b> | up one rather weak pun." -- David Fletcher
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Kinda included:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "At first I thought this was just another boring empty-apartment game.
<b>Floyd</b> | Then came the piranhas." -- Sarah Morayati (implementation: piranhas
<b>Floyd</b> | yes, boring empty-apartment game only kinda)
<b>Floyd</b> | "Brilliant! This is the first four-move game I've actually enjoyed."
<b>Floyd</b> | -- Royce Odle (implementation: although the game ends most frequently
<b>Floyd</b> | at four moves, it can still be stretched to five or six with care)
<b>Floyd</b> | "With a naked eye or microscope you will be able to identify 180
<b>Floyd</b> | hardwoods, softwoods amd tropical woods." -- Roger Carbol
<b>Floyd</b> | (implementation: only 60, all hardwoods, no microscope)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Not included:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The wryly savage condemnation of the 17th-century Neapolitan court is
<b>Floyd</b> | a knee-slapper, despite being couched so shyly in metaphor." -- S.
<b>Floyd</b> | John Ross
<b>Floyd</b> | "Writing a keyword-based game using no verbs, not even in the
<b>Floyd</b> | descriptions, must've been nothing short of impossible." -- Marius
<b>Floyd</b> | M?ller
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I strongly recommend checking the walkthrough (command: WALKTHROUGH)
<b>Floyd</b> | because the intended form of this game is lacking about two weeks of
<b>Floyd</b> | implementation on the execution, and very little is adequately clued
<b>Floyd</b> | (plus there's a whole lot unimplemented).  With that said, feel free

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | This little toy/game was written for the "SpeedIF Jacket 4" Event, and
<b>Floyd</b> | is (sadly) my first solo release as an author. Much as the 2004 Will
<b>Floyd</b> | Smith movie "I, Robot" was based on the Asimov short story collection
<b>Floyd</b> | of the same name, Spectrum was based on the following blurbs:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "A vivid exercise in character-development, undermined by the fact
<b>Floyd</b> | that nobody, author and player included, has a clue what's going on."
<b>Floyd</b> | -- Sam Kabo Ashwell
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Countries with strong censorship laws would never allow this game to
<b>Floyd</b> | exist - and they are poorer for it." -- S. John Ross
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I've never seen a "one-room game" that contained so many discrete
<b>Floyd</b> | areas before." -- Carolyn VanEseltine
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "What... The... Fuck?" -- Tanga
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "An intelligent and lucid thriller that marries the gusto of an
<b>Floyd</b> | international murder mystery with a collection of fascinating
<b>Floyd</b> | esoteria." -- Roger Carbol
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "An excellent argument against giving personal computers to
<b>Floyd</b> | nine-year-olds." -- Sarah Morayati
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The layout of Spectrum's mindscape was inspired by this chart, which I
<b>Floyd</b> | found on the ilovecharts tumblr:
<b>Floyd</b> | [<A HREF="http://ilovecharts.tumblr.com/post/4528475185/via-wontloversrevoltnow">LINK</A>]
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | That's it! This was harrowing but fun. Many thanks to my domestic and
<b>Floyd</b> | writing partner, Carolyn VanEseltine, for helping me out with the
<b>Floyd</b> | chunks of code I didn't know but also for letting me figure the rest
