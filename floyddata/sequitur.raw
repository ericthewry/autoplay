					<p class="leftalign">
					<span class="fontish smaller">Like ClubFloyd, the idea behind NightFloyd is that a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.<br><br>Unlike ClubFloyd, NightFloyd often takes on significantly larger works of interactive fiction, knowing going in that each one will take multiple sessions (but not always, as you'll see in this transcript). NightFloyd is also a bit more informal than ClubFloyd in that it's only announced on the ifMUD #clubfloyd bulletin board, and the time shifts around to meet player's schedules far more than ClubFloyd does. NightFloyd is organized by genericgeekgirl, aka Adri.<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Sequitur</em> written by Tin Foil Jenny.
						It was released as part of ShuffleComp 2014, and was one of the ten Commended games.
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting

					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing this game, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played this game, and think you might like to at some

<b>Floyd</b> | Detective Cochone is being tortured by a dancing bear. The small toy
<b>Floyd</b> | bobs on the desk, its cymbals crashing out an eardrum-tearing beat
<b>Floyd</b> | that shouldn't be possible for such tiny plates of gold-colored tin.
<b>Floyd</b> | Cochone's head pounds in sympathy. Even the walls of Jenny's office
<b>Floyd</b> | seem to shake. With a sour expression, Cochone turns away from the
<b>Floyd</b> | cacophony.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Okay, so you don't like Happy Jack," Jenny says as the bear stops
<b>Floyd</b> | clapping. Seated in her wheelchair in front of the only other desk in
<b>Floyd</b> | the office, Jenny frowns in mock disappointment. "Somebody has a bad

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The morning has been a bit rough," Cochone says. "I think I'm coming

<b>Floyd</b> | "Just do me  a favor and keep the volume down."

<b>Floyd</b> | Jacques Dutronc. And to help lighten the mood , we'll add 'Hot Dog.'
<b>Floyd</b> | She taps some keys on the laptop, and "Venus and Serena" begins to

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "So, can you tell me a little bit about the case you're working on?"
<b>Floyd</b> | Jenny says.  "It's that house in the bayou?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Right." Cochone sighs. "At about 7:00 Thursday night a guy, Mr.
<b>Floyd</b> | Mayer, was walking his weiner dog on the outskirts of the Belle
<b>Floyd</b> | Bayou."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Was his name Oscar? The dog. It was a daschund, right?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Right. He finds a young woman. Twentysomething. She is barely
<b>Floyd</b> | conscious. She points into the trees. Passes out. Mayer sees some
<b>Floyd</b> | smoke. He calls emergency. They search the area. Turns out there's a
<b>Floyd</b> | house there with a fire in the basement and two burned bodies. Two
<b>Floyd</b> | more people are found dead. Shot. All young, your age. There is also a
<b>Floyd</b> | lot of recording equipment, and some cell phones. We spend all day in
<b>Floyd</b> | and around the house gathering it all up for your little pet project.
<b>Floyd</b> | And today I'm hoping it will talk because right now the woman is in a
<b>Floyd</b> | coma, and we don't even know who any of them are."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Jenny's smile finally fades. "Well, I'm sure we'll figure it out."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It doesn't look good for the woman. Five-to-one says she won't make

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Jenny's eyes widen. "I, I don't like taking chances." She frowns.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Especially when it involves someone's life."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Cochone shrugs. "She lives or dies either way."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Arms crossed, Jenny glances at the computer. "Maybe you should get

<b>Floyd</b> | Stephen Cochone scrambled out of bed this morning, rushing to the
<b>Floyd</b> | toilet to vomit. That was actually a good thing; he slept through the
<b>Floyd</b> | alarm, but he still had time for a quick shower and a splash of
<b>Floyd</b> | cologne. He was going to work with a young woman today, after all.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If it wasn't for Jenny, he would have probably called in sick. His
<b>Floyd</b> | queasy stomach has settled, but his head pounds, and he has difficulty
<b>Floyd</b> | focusing his itchy eyes. This type of wake-up call was supposed to
<b>Floyd</b> | have ended when he had graduated from college and swore off the booze.
<b>Floyd</b> | That was the year his father, a vice cop, drove head-on into a truck,
<b>Floyd</b> | killing himself and his wife, Stephen's mother. They had just stumbled
<b>Floyd</b> | away from their wedding anniversary celebration at the bar where,
<b>Floyd</b> | twenty years previous, Stephen's father had stuffed dollar bills in
<b>Floyd</b> | his future wife's g-string. Perhaps alcohol abstinence has prevented
<b>Floyd</b> | some of the physical decline associated with age and detective work in
<b>Floyd</b> | a large city; Stephen looks generally the same as he did during his
<b>Floyd</b> | college years, with a few creases around the eyes and gray hairs that
<b>Floyd</b> | appeared during and after the divorce, when his ex decided to take his
<b>Floyd</b> | daughters to New York with her.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Cochone's legs begin to ache, and he shifts in his seat to releive the

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "What?" Cochone says, turning away from the computer screen.

<b>Floyd</b> | "I didn't sign up for breaking and entering," a man with a face so

<b>Floyd</b> | The video stutters, blacks out.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The footage starts again. An enclosed counter fronted by clear glass
<b>Floyd</b> | sits in the feeble light cast by the window beside it. A pipe snakes
<b>Floyd</b> | from the top of the fumehood and attaches to the wall.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Wow," a man says. The camera swings around and catches Veggie
<b>Floyd</b> | standing over another counter, its length swallowed in the gloom of
<b>Floyd</b> | the basement. Veggie's flashlight beam glides along its black surface,
<b>Floyd</b> | picking out bottles, a digital weigh scale, flasks, and a sink. It
<b>Floyd</b> | comes to rest on a humming refrigerator.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "What's that smell?" Veggie says.  "Sulfur?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Maybe this was a mistake, Salt." A woman's voice, the camera
<b>Floyd</b> | operator. "Argo?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The camera finds Argo pointing his flashlight over boxes in a corner.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The video goes black and when the footage starts again, Argo is
<b>Floyd</b> | starting up some stairs with Salt behind him. A tall figure emerges
<b>Floyd</b> | from behind them. Its eyes are large and bulging. It throws a cloud of
<b>Floyd</b> | glittering powder into their faces. Both men collapse gasping and
<b>Floyd</b> | coughing onto the floor. The camera dips as its operator begins to
<b>Floyd</b> | sway.  She hacks and sputters.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Argo twitches, trapped by seizure. The figure, whose face is covered
<b>Floyd</b> | by a gas mask, bends down and places a bag over Salt's head.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The camera turns to the stairs. The video fades and goes black.

<b>Floyd</b> | Her bracelet, which is on the arm holding the phone, has slid down

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Jenny is stuck in a wheelchair that is a bit too small for her lanky
<b>Floyd</b> | body. Cochone has pieced together parts of her story from other cops.
<b>Floyd</b> | She hasn't always needed the wheels and cane. She had walked the beat
<b>Floyd</b> | when she joined the force, but her career path had veered off course
<b>Floyd</b> | after her drunken boyfriend found her in his house with another guy.
<b>Floyd</b> | His response was bone shattering. Jenny was smart enough to leave Mr.

<b>Floyd</b> | A closeup of Neo. Her face scrunches, and the camera shakes. "C'mon
<b>Floyd</b> | you stupid thing. Work." Floorboards moan. Neo looks up. The phone is
<b>Floyd</b> | cast aside, but its eye peeks from a crook in the floral-patterned
<b>Floyd</b> | sofa. It captures Xeno gasping and coughing in the hall.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Neo rushes to Xeno and helps her into the sunlit room. "Xeno? What's
<b>Floyd</b> | wrong?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Xeno sputters, bends over.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Neo turns to face the window and disappears from view. "Xeno? There's
<b>Floyd</b> | some men coming." She reappears  at Xeno's side.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The view stutters, scrambles, goes black.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Audio only. Xeno sucks air. A thud.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The camera flicks on. A woman — fortyish and tall — is standing
<b>Floyd</b> | over
<b>Floyd</b> | Xeno and Neo, who huddle together on the floor, oblivious. The woman
<b>Floyd</b> | hauls Neo to her feet and pulls her toward the camera. Neo twists, but
<b>Floyd</b> | she can't free her arms. "Who? Let me." Neo continues to struggle. The
<b>Floyd</b> | woman shifts her stance, flashing a yellow flower tattoo on her arm.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Xeno, having regained some control over her breathing, gets to her
<b>Floyd</b> | feet. She looks left, darts away to her right.

<b>Floyd</b> | Crackle. Black.

<b>Floyd</b> | The video starts with a closeup of Neo. She stares into the camera,
<b>Floyd</b> | her eyes a shade of blue lighter than that of her hair. She pulls the
<b>Floyd</b> | camera away from her face. "Seems to work okay out here."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The camera turns to Nickell, who is sitting propped up against a
<b>Floyd</b> | cypress and snarfing down a submarine sandwich. Behind him, the
<b>Floyd</b> | sluggish Mississippi River caresses the posts of several dilapitated
<b>Floyd</b> | docks.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I hope —" Nickell says, but Neo interrupts him.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Sshh!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A furry head peers out at the camera from a bush to the left of
<b>Floyd</b> | Nickell. The camera pans over to the animal, its fluffy tail twitching
<b>Floyd</b> | against its twiggy camouflage.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Quiet," Neo says. "I've got a great idea."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nickell says something that sounds like "Two in ten minutes. That's
<b>Floyd</b> | good."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Shut up and be quiet. This will be a cool shot if it works."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The camera jiggles across some trees and away from the animal. Neo's
<b>Floyd</b> | hand places a strawberry on the grass, then the camera descends to
<b>Floyd</b> | ground level and focuses on the fruit center screen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Minutes pass with the occasional twitter and call from some birds.
<b>Floyd</b> | Then, a squirrel enters the frame. It scurries awkwardly over to the
<b>Floyd</b> | strawberry, nose twitching. Its black fur is speckled with gold dust.
<b>Floyd</b> | The squirrel snatches up the bait and scampers off, dragging one
<b>Floyd</b> | hindleg through the grass.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It worked!" Neo shrieks. The camera is pulled from the ground.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Gotcha my pretty. Salt will love this."

<b>Floyd</b> | follows her as she walks passed a van, footfalls crunching gravel.
<b>Floyd</b> | Birds respond with their own loud calls. The camera joins the two then
<b>Floyd</b> | scans some ash trees as if searching for them. It circles back round

<b>Floyd</b> | The footage jiggles as the camera follows the pair, its operator
<b>Floyd</b> | breathing hard.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The shaky camera settles on a large clearing crowded by trees and

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Zoom in. A hindleg of one of the squirrels hangs limply over the side

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Are you getting this, Xeno?" Neo says.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The squirrels leap from the bowl and scamper up a nearby tree, their

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Neo rushes over to the large fountain centered in the yard. "Whoa!"
<b>Floyd</b> | She steps back and stares at three sculpted figures. "Is that his ...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nickell saunters up next to her. "Yep. And those are hers, and those

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The camera tightens in on the three naked figures: a man standing in

<b>Floyd</b> | another girl standing on the other, their hands caressing his body.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "They look a bit young, don't you think?" Neo says. "Kind of gross.
<b>Floyd</b> | It's not like an innocent little boy peeing, that's for sure."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nickell continues to study the girls. He turns away and looks at the

<b>Floyd</b> | "I didn't sign up for breaking and entering," Argo says. He rams a
<b>Floyd</b> | tripod leg between wood boards and the side of the house at his feet.
<b>Floyd</b> | He pulls the tool, and two boards separate from the clapboard with a

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A murder of blackbirds caw and fly off.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I told you, nobody owns this place," Salt says, sliding a knife into

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Argo and Salt free the remaining boards.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The video stutters, blacks out.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The footage starts again. An enclosed counter fronted by clear glass
<b>Floyd</b> | sits in the feeble light cast by the window beside it. A pipe snakes
<b>Floyd</b> | from the top of the fumehood and attaches to the wall.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Wow," a man says. The camera swings around and catches Salt standing
<b>Floyd</b> | over another counter, its length swallowed in the gloom of the
<b>Floyd</b> | basement. Salt's flashlight beam glides along its black surface,
<b>Floyd</b> | picking out bottles, a digital weigh scale, flasks, and a sink. It
<b>Floyd</b> | comes to rest on a humming refrigerator.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "What's that smell?" Salt says.  "Sulfur?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Maybe this was a mistake, Salt." A woman's voice, the camera
<b>Floyd</b> | operator. "Argo?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The camera finds Argo pointing his flashlight over boxes in a corner.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The video goes black and when the footage starts again, Argo is
<b>Floyd</b> | starting up some stairs with Salt behind him. The figure wearing the
<b>Floyd</b> | gas mask emerges from behind them. It throws a cloud of glittering
<b>Floyd</b> | powder into their faces. Both men collapse gasping and coughing onto
<b>Floyd</b> | the floor. The camera dips as its operator begins to sway.  She hacks
<b>Floyd</b> | and sputters.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Argo twitches, trapped by seizure. The figuredraped in darkness bends
<b>Floyd</b> | down and places a bag over Salt's head.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The camera turns to the stairs. The video fades and goes black.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The songs I had to choose from for the 2014 ShuffleComp:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Courtney Barnett "Avant Gardener"
<b>Floyd</b> | Yosi Horikawa "Wandering"
<b>Floyd</b> | Jacques Dutronc "Il Est Cinq Heures Paris S'eveille"
<b>Floyd</b> | The Animals "House of the Rising Sun"
<b>Floyd</b> | Super Furry Animals "Venus and Serena"
<b>Floyd</b> | Chris Powell "Hot Dog"
<b>Floyd</b> | The Golden Filter "Solid Gold"
<b>Floyd</b> | Red Fang "Wires"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Several months before ShuffleComp came along in April 2014, I was
<b>Floyd</b> | wondering how a work of interactive fiction could be based on the
<b>Floyd</b> | found footage genre of filmmaking. I wasn't planning on entering the
<b>Floyd</b> | competition, because I was afraid I couldn't develop and implement a
<b>Floyd</b> | game within the time alotted. But, a few days before the playlists
<b>Floyd</b> | were to be submitted, I thought about how a game could be constructed
<b>Floyd</b> | like a CD, with individual tracks making up a whole album. The
<b>Floyd</b> | interface could be much like a CD player. Then I realized this fit
<b>Floyd</b> | well with my found footage idea, and <span class="floydstyle em">sequitur</span> followed from
<b>Floyd</b> | there.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Of the songs on the playlist I received, "House of the Rising Sun" and
<b>Floyd</b> | "Solid Gold" had the greatest influence on <span class="floydstyle em">sequitur.</span> The
<b>Floyd</b> | Asian brothel and Cochone's gambling were inspired by The Animals'
<b>Floyd</b> | song, as was the prison (which some music critics think is the real
<b>Floyd</b> | "House of the Rising Sun"). The band name, The Animals, also inspired
<b>Floyd</b> | the naming of the main characters, and Jenny's dogs are named after
<b>Floyd</b> | members of the band. Because of "Solid Gold," i added the
<b>Floyd</b> | chemical/alchemical aspect of the story. References are made
<b>Floyd</b> | throughout the game to elements — the names of the band members are
<b>Floyd</b> | abbreviated names for the noble gases argon, neon, and xenon, for
<b>Floyd</b> | example. "Hot Dog" and, to a lesser extent, "Il Est Cinq Heures Paris
<b>Floyd</b> | S'eveille" also influenced <span class="floydstyle em">sequitur</span>. Most obviously,
<b>Floyd</b> | Cochone's favorite food, the name of the band, and the vegetarian
<b>Floyd</b> | references were inspired by the former, and the Fench element was
<b>Floyd</b> | included because of the latter. This is just a sample of how these
<b>Floyd</b> | songs shaped the game; you'll likely find other similarities.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I chose these songs based on listening to them, not on their videos.
<b>Floyd</b> | Only after <span class="floydstyle em">sequitur</span> was being developed did I go through the
<b>Floyd</b> | videos. As it turns out, those for "Wandering" and "Wires" share some
<b>Floyd</b> | themes with the game, but these similarities are coincidental. I
<b>Floyd</b> | enjoyed all of the songs on my playlist — six of the eight were new
<b>Floyd</b> | to
<b>Floyd</b> | me. Listen to all of them then turn on the radio. After all, the word
<b>Floyd</b> | "music" is derived from the Greek "muse."

<b>Floyd</b> | The members of <span class="floydstyle em">Chien Chaud, Chat Froid</span> and the video

<b>Floyd</b> | their latest album ("Kitchen"). The gang then splits up; Neo, Nickell,
<b>Floyd</b> | and Xeno explore outside ("Backyard" and "Dead Zone") while Argo and
<b>Floyd</b> | Salt scout the rooms for somewhere to set up their equipment
<b>Floyd</b> | ("Diary"). Neo and Xeno find Kiku ("Chrysanthemum") while Nickell
<b>Floyd</b> | places a camera outside to record the backyard ("Time Lapse"). Argo,
<b>Floyd</b> | Neo, and Xeno pass Nickell, who is entering the house, on their way to
<b>Floyd</b> | see Salt in the kitchen ("Locked Door"). Salt investigates the ring
<b>Floyd</b> | (which Neo found while urinating in the trees) and the diary contents
<b>Floyd</b> | ("Google"). Neo and Nickell decide to eat outside, where the latter
<b>Floyd</b> | sets up his audio recorder ("Sound Test"), and Neo discovers the
<b>Floyd</b> | injured squirrel has been exposed to the gold powder ("Squirrel
<b>Floyd</b> | Trap"). Despite exposure, the squirrel seems healthy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Salt convinces Argo and Xeno to break into the basement through the
<b>Floyd</b> | boarded-up windows, and they are attacked by Kiku's daughter
<b>Floyd</b> | ("Basement"). The startled blackbirds are caught by the audio
<b>Floyd</b> | recorder, which also picks up the arrival of the terrorists, Nickell
<b>Floyd</b> | retrieving the oar, and Kiku's daughter leaving in the boat with one
<b>Floyd</b> | of the terrorists ("Diary"). Neo has already returned to the house and
<b>Floyd</b> | tries to help Xeno, but the terrorists arrive ("Fight"). Xeno escapes,
<b>Floyd</b> | but Neo and Nickell are killed. Xeno runs up to Kiku's room where Kiku
<b>Floyd</b> | helps her escape out the window ("Escape"). The terrorists and Kiku's
<b>Floyd</b> | daughter decide to burn the laboratory before leaving ("Torching").
