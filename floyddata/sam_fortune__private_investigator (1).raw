The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Sam Fortune - Private Investigator</i>, written by Steve Blanding.  <I>Sam Fortune - Private Investigator</I> is a mystery game presented as a radio play sponsored by Muskrat Cigarettes. It was released in May 2009 and you can visit its homepage <A HREF="http://housefullofgames.com/SamFortune/"><u>here</u></A>.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Sam_Fortune_-_Private_Investigator'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sam Fortune - Private Investigator
<b>Floyd</b> | A transcribed drama filled with suspense and adventure by Steve
<b>Floyd</b> | Blanding
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 1 / Serial number 090510 / Inform 7 build 5U92 (I6/v6.31 lib
<b>Floyd</b> | 6/12N)
<b>Floyd</b> | (You may type "HELP" at any time for hints, credits or just general
<b>Floyd</b> | information about this game.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Tonight's drama: The Case of the Missing Playboy!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sponsored by Muskrat Cigarettes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Folks, do you know that four out of five doctors recommend Muskrat
<b>Floyd</b> | Cigarettes for their patients who smoke? It's true! That's because
<b>Floyd</b> | Muskrat Cigarettes have been clinically proven to taste better, smoke
<b>Floyd</b> | smoother, and improve respiratory health! So the next time you crave a
<b>Floyd</b> | good smoke, choose Muskrat Cigarettes! You'll be glad you did.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And now for Act I of tonight's drama....
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It was an afternoon much like any other afternoon. I was alone in my
<b>Floyd</b> | office. It seems I was always alone.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Business had been slow. I was reduced to practicing my witty banter
<b>Floyd</b> | with my friends Jack and Daniel. Unfortunately for me, they weren't
<b>Floyd</b> | very much for conversation. We'd been conversing just long enough that
<b>Floyd</b> | I was beginning to feel that my banter really WAS witty. But not so
<b>Floyd</b> | much that I was beginning to think they'd talk back.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sam's Office
<b>Floyd</b> | You are Sam Fortune, a private investigator who, at the moment, has
<b>Floyd</b> | very little to investigate. Your office is on the fifth floor of a
<b>Floyd</b> | crummy old office building in the lower east side.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a single dingy window in the west wall, directly opposite the
<b>Floyd</b> | only door.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The sun streaming throught the Venetian blinds traces bars across the
<b>Floyd</b> | desk that sits in the middle of the room.  Bars like the bars of a
<b>Floyd</b> | prison cell.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the wooden desk are a bottle of whiskey and a telephone.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A battered old filing cabinet stands in the corner.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An old desk chair sits behind the desk.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A plain guest chair is strategically placed in front of the desk.

<b>Floyd</b> | Top Cat Club
<b>Floyd</b> | You have to admit that this place is pretty swank. Like the lobby, it's

<b>Floyd</b> | is filled with tables, which in turn are filled with the

<b>Floyd</b> | it looks like a penguin convention, and enough feathers to defrock a
<b>Floyd</b> | flock of ostriches.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The central focus of the club is the dance floor, just south of the
<b>Floyd</b> | stage, which fills the entire north wall of the room. There is a small
<b>Floyd</b> | backstage door in the north wall, just to the side of the stage. A guy
<b>Floyd</b> | about the size of Mt. Rushmore guards the door.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The bar is to the east. The lobby is south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see the backstage door, the stage, some customers, some tables,
<b>Floyd</b> | some dancers and a guard here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Someone at one of the far tables sings Happy Birthday.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You hear the sound of someone opening the backstage door.

<b>Floyd</b> | The band stops playing and the bandleader steps up to the microphone.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Ladies and gentlemen. Once again, the Top Cat Club is proud to present

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The crowd erupts into applause, the lights go down, a spotlight

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Are you looking for the finest experience in smoking pleasure? Then you
<b>Floyd</b> | really owe it to yourself to try Muskrat Cigarettes. You see, four out
<b>Floyd</b> | of five doctors recommend Muskrat Cigarettes. That's because Muskrat
<b>Floyd</b> | Cigarettes are smoother, better tasting, and better for you! Indeed,
<b>Floyd</b> | recent studies suggest that smoking just one pack of Muskrat Cigarettes
<b>Floyd</b> | a day can improve respiratory vitality and provide you with more pep!
<b>Floyd</b> | So the next time you crave a fine smoke, reach for Muskrat Cigarettes.
<b>Floyd</b> | You'll be glad you did because remember:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nothing smokes like a Muskrat!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And now: we bring you Act II of tonight's thrilling adventure of Sam

<b>Floyd</b> | My encounter with Mickey Boy and Weasel Face Flynn made it pretty clear
<b>Floyd</b> | that Tony Gabriele was up to something.  I still wasn't sure what it
<b>Floyd</b> | was but by now I was pretty sure that Irene had nothing to do with it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Once again, I ducked down the stairs and headed out into the dark,
<b>Floyd</b> | lonely streets. It was well past midnight now and the streets were
<b>Floyd</b> | mostly deserted. I didn't dare risk grabbing a cab; instead I walked
<b>Floyd</b> | the few blocks to the train station to keep my appointment with Irene.
<b>Floyd</b> | Along the way I had to duck into a couple of alleys to avoid the
<b>Floyd</b> | occasional copper. The last thing I needed was for some flatfoot beat
<b>Floyd</b> | cop to earn a promotion on my account tonight.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It wasn't long before I found myself in front of the station. Now all I
<b>Floyd</b> | had to do was slip inside, get to the center platform and keep my
<b>Floyd</b> | rendezvous with Irene.

<b>Floyd</b> | I stepped out of the shadows and said, "Officers, I'm glad to see you.
<b>Floyd</b> | I think you'll want to take a look at what's in those crates over
<b>Floyd</b> | there. I think you'll discover that Mr. Gabriele and his stooges here
<b>Floyd</b> | have just received a large supply of narcotics. The other night Bob

<b>Floyd</b> | Stairs to the Lower Level
<b>Floyd</b> | You're standing at the top of the flight of stairs leading down to the
<b>Floyd</b> | platforms.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To the south, you can see the whole of the waiting area. You're well
<b>Floyd</b> | concealed so there is no fear of being spotted by the policeman who is
<b>Floyd</b> | patrolling there. Down and to the north, you can just make out part of
<b>Floyd</b> | the lower level of the train station.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The policeman is crossing the center of the waiting area, heading
<b>Floyd</b> | north.

<b>Floyd</b> | [Your score has just gone up by one point.]
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lower Level of the Train Station
<b>Floyd</b> | The lower level of the train station is a large space which opens on to
<b>Floyd</b> | three platforms.  Directly in front of you, to the north, is the
<b>Floyd</b> | central platform, to the north east is the east platform, and to the
<b>Floyd</b> | north west is the west platform.  Naturally, there are train tracks
<b>Floyd</b> | running between the platforms.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There are numerous pillars supporting the high arched ceiling.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The stairs that lead back to the waiting area are behind you, to the
<b>Floyd</b> | south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can barely make out a figure on the central platform which you hope
<b>Floyd</b> | must be Irene.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Between you and the central platform stands a policeman. You can only
<b>Floyd</b> | assume that he's looking for you.
