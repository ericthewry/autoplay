The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>The Blind House</i>, written by Amanda Allen as "Maude Overton".  <I>The Blind House</I> was originally released as part of the 2010 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took fourth place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/The_Blind_House'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | On the other hand, it seems pointless to question her motives when I'm

<b>Floyd</b> | Marissa's bedroom is initially confusing to the eye; the walls are
<b>Floyd</b> | almost entirely covered in an eccentric display of unframed paintings
<b>Floyd</b> | and tiny mirrors in mismatched frames. Lace curtains drape over a
<b>Floyd</b> | window in the north wall, letting dappled light filter onto a
<b>Floyd</b> | white-framed bed. In the dimly-lit south side of the room is a bedside
<b>Floyd</b> | table, covered in a pale floral cloth and a reading lamp. A white
<b>Floyd</b> | wardrobe, far less intimidating than the one in the spare room, is
<b>Floyd</b> | here too. The door is to the west.

<b>Floyd</b> | Marissa is here. She weeps steadily into one hand.

<b>Floyd</b> | Anything I have done is only to protect you. I'm here, now. You don't

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I lean forward and embrace her gently. Her little frame, at first so
