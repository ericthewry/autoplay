The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Adventurers Consumer Guide</i>, written by Øyvind Thorsby.  <I>Adventurers Consumer Guide</I> was originally released in 2007.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Adventurer%27s_Consumer_Guide'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Adventurer's Consumer Guide
<b>Floyd</b> | You are a product tester for the Adventurer's Consumer Guide, a
<b>Floyd</b> | magazine that reviews all sorts of equipment an adventurer might need
<b>Floyd</b> | for his adventures. Your magazine is highly respected because of the
<b>Floyd</b> | thorough tests you put the equipment through. The tests aren't just
<b>Floyd</b> | done at the magazine's offices. No, the product testers go on actual
<b>Floyd</b> | adventures to test the equipment out in the field. Sometimes you kill
<b>Floyd</b> | an evil overlord; sometimes you rescue a fair maiden. Most of the time,
<b>Floyd</b> | like today, you just go out looking for a treasure in Treasure Cave
<b>Floyd</b> | Mountain, a perfect place for adventures as it contains plenty of
<b>Floyd</b> | caves, treasures, monsters and traps.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you are putting on the soon-to-be-tested magical coat, magical ring
<b>Floyd</b> | and magical helmet, your editor says, "On this mission you'll be having
<b>Floyd</b> | a helper with you."
<b>Floyd</b> | "Really?" you say. You usually work alone.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yeah, but it's part of a test. See, there's this new agency that is
<b>Floyd</b> | renting out sidekicks. We are going to write a review about it. Oh,
<b>Floyd</b> | here he is now."
<b>Floyd</b> | Into your office walks a goblin: a green humanoid creature with pointy
<b>Floyd</b> | ears, about a meter tall. "Hi, you must be my new boss," he says to
<b>Floyd</b> | you.
<b>Floyd</b> | "I guess I am. What is it you're supposed to do, exactly?"
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, I'm very brave and helpful, plus I'm a ferocious killing
<b>Floyd</b> | machine. If you see any kind of monster, or anything at all, and you
<b>Floyd</b> | want it killed, just tell me, and it's toast."
<b>Floyd</b> | "Okay... well, I think we should get going."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You and your new companion are off to Treasure Cave Mountain. Your
<b>Floyd</b> | mission is to return with one really big treasure. Any really big
<b>Floyd</b> | treasure.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you are unfamiliar with interactive fiction, type HELP.
<b>Floyd</b> | If you care, type CREDITS.
<b>Floyd</b> | In this game you can't examine things. Instead use either "look" to see
<b>Floyd</b> | descriptions of the things in the room you are in, or "inventory" to
<b>Floyd</b> | see descriptions of what you are carrying. You also can't use "look
<b>Floyd</b> | inside", "look under", "look behind", "look &lt;direction&gt;" or "search".
<b>Floyd</b> | But you can use "read".
<b>Floyd</b> | To see your inventory without the long descriptions of all you are
<b>Floyd</b> | carrying, type: "inventory short". Or simply: "i s". Or simply: "is".
<b>Floyd</b> | No time passes when you use "look" or "inventory".
<b>Floyd</b> | You communicate by "talk to [whatever]", or by giving commands in this
<b>Floyd</b> | format: "goblin, give me the cow-o-meter".
<b>Floyd</b> | It is possible to put this game in an unwinnable state, but you should
<b>Floyd</b> | be able to figure out when this has happened.
<b>Floyd</b> | Should you wish to re-read the above information during the game, type
<b>Floyd</b> | ABOUT.

<b>Floyd</b> | On a mountain ledge
<b>Floyd</b> | A narrow mountain ledge leading west (where you came from) and east. To
<b>Floyd</b> | the north is a tall mountain wall and to the south a long drop.
<b>Floyd</b> | Very far to the east, near the end of the ledge, a huge monster is
<b>Floyd</b> | crouching. Its green skin is scaly, its body is bloated like a balloon,
<b>Floyd</b> | its four feet have long terrible claws, its wide mouth has thousands of
<b>Floyd</b> | sharp teeth and on top of its head is a cluster of about fifty bulging
<b>Floyd</b> | eyes as big as your head.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see the goblin sidekick here.

<b>Floyd</b> | commercial it will start to vibrate when you are close to danger.
<b>Floyd</b> | A mail-ordered short metal staff with a clear orb on the end. Its
<b>Floyd</b> | manufacturers say the staff will remove any creature that comes in
<b>Floyd</b> | contact with the orb. Inside the orb you can see a small unmoving
<b>Floyd</b> | cluster of turquoise tentacles.
<b>Floyd</b> | A Remmingheim Supreme crossbow, loaded with an arrow. The Supreme model
<b>Floyd</b> | is supposed to have a special feature. When you shoot it, the arrow
<b>Floyd</b> | will magically return, and the crossbow will be loaded again. The hard,
<b>Floyd</b> | razor-sharp arrow is protruding a good ten centimeters from the front
<b>Floyd</b> | of the crossbow.
<b>Floyd</b> | "The Ultimate Creature Manual" by Arthur Hippoman. According to the
<b>Floyd</b> | back it contains information about every single monster in the world,
<b>Floyd</b> | and how to defend yourself against them. It is suspiciously thin.
<b>Floyd</b> | A small cage. It is closed and locked with a code-lock (You know the
<b>Floyd</b> | code.). A gremlin, a small green humanoid creature with pointy ears, is
<b>Floyd</b> | trapped inside. He is wearing a tiny ring. He is smoking a tiny
<b>Floyd</b> | cigarette. His thin arms are sticking through the bars of the cage, and
<b>Floyd</b> | he is fiddling with the code-lock, trying one combination at a time.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You are wearing:
<b>Floyd</b> | A Hustlespleen & Poe Coat of Invisibility, though at the moment it
<b>Floyd</b> | looks like an ordinary, long, brown, coat. It is supposed to turn
<b>Floyd</b> | invisible (or turn visible again) whenever you say the magic word
<b>Floyd</b> | "tango".
<b>Floyd</b> | A Super Champion Helmet fastened with a strap under your chin. It is
<b>Floyd</b> | round and made of thin metal. It is supposed to magically turn you into
<b>Floyd</b> | a hero.
<b>Floyd</b> | On your finger is a Snuffelburg & Co. Type F Magical Ring. It is red
<b>Floyd</b> | and golden. It is supposed to protect you from any magical rays, by
<b>Floyd</b> | moving the effect of the ray away from you and onto the gremlin, which
<b>Floyd</b> | is wearing a smaller, magically connected, ring.
<b>Floyd</b> | A pair of red boxer shorts, decorated with tiny teddy-bears dressed as
<b>Floyd</b> | sailors. They are not something you are supposed to test; they are your
<b>Floyd</b> | own.

<b>Floyd</b> | On a mountain ledge
<b>Floyd</b> | The end of a narrow mountain ledge leading west. The tall mountain wall
<b>Floyd</b> | has three caves: to the northwest, north and northeast.
<b>Floyd</b> | A huge monster is crouching on the ledge. Its green skin is scaly, its
<b>Floyd</b> | body is bloated like a balloon, its four feet have long terrible claws,
<b>Floyd</b> | its wide mouth has thousands of sharp teeth and on top of its head is a
<b>Floyd</b> | cluster of about fifty bulging eyes as big as your head.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A mail-ordered short metal staff with a clear orb on the end lies here.
<b>Floyd</b> | Its manufacturers say the staff will remove any creature that comes in

<b>Floyd</b> | He is now tiny and unmoving.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A gigantic monster is here. It seem to consist entirely of a cluster of
<b>Floyd</b> | many entwined writhing turquoise tentacles. There are no legs or arms
<b>Floyd</b> | or head. Each tentacle is as thick as a person and none seem to be
<b>Floyd</b> | shorter than five meters.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A tentacle grabs the tongue of the green monster and begins to pull.
<b>Floyd</b> | But the tongue pulls back, and the tentacle is dragged into the mouth
<b>Floyd</b> | of the green monster. The green monster bites off the end of the

<b>Floyd</b> | into the cluster of tentacles. The green monster chews on the tip of

<b>Floyd</b> | A short lever with a handle sticks out from a wall. The handle has a
<b>Floyd</b> | thin, wide gap, large enough for the fingers of one hand to go through.
<b>Floyd</b> | A metallic pyramid, about half a meter high, sticks up from the cave
<b>Floyd</b> | floor. You once tested a hundred different teleporters, and you
<b>Floyd</b> | recognize the pyramid as one of the safest and least complicated
<b>Floyd</b> | models. To use it you just stand on it and shake the lever repeatedly.
<b>Floyd</b> | This particular teleporter seems badly designed though: the lever is
<b>Floyd</b> | far away from it, almost on the other side of the cave.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Up from the lever sticks the new magical sword from Adventurer's
<b>Floyd</b> | Emporium. According to the commercial it will start to vibrate when you
<b>Floyd</b> | are close to danger. It is shaking like crazy, but not enough to shake
<b>Floyd</b> | the lever.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The goblin comes running after you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The sword goes even crazier and starts thrashing like a headless
<b>Floyd</b> | chicken on drugs.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The sword makes the lever shake. There comes a low humming sound from
<b>Floyd</b> | the teleporter.

<b>Floyd</b> | Tremendous Cave
<b>Floyd</b> | An extremely bright light comes from this cave's only exit to the
<b>Floyd</b> | south.
<b>Floyd</b> | Some runes are written on the wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | A genie floats about a meter above the ground. He looks like a man made
<b>Floyd</b> | of ice. He is bald, but has a beard of icicles. He has no legs; his
<b>Floyd</b> | stomach rises from a small cloud of icy steam. He holds an ice sabre.
<b>Floyd</b> | A hippoman, half man, half hippo, stands knitting something yellow. He
<b>Floyd</b> | is fat, purple and has two very thick legs.
<b>Floyd</b> | A young angry-looking woman stands holding a large placard saying "Save
<b>Floyd</b> | the monsters!" She is clearly one of those monster rights activists
<b>Floyd</b> | that have been making your job so much harder lately.
<b>Floyd</b> | The gremlin has climbed quite high up on the wall. He is a small green
<b>Floyd</b> | humanoid creature with pointy ears. He is wearing a tiny ring and is
<b>Floyd</b> | smoking a tiny cigarette.
<b>Floyd</b> | A large metal chest stands up against a wall. It is closed.
<b>Floyd</b> | A large machine is at the back of the cave. Its mechanisms looks very
<b>Floyd</b> | complex. Actually it is very easy to use. You know this because on a
<b>Floyd</b> | previous product-testing mission you came across a machine just like it
<b>Floyd</b> | and spend four hours trying to figure out how it worked. The machine is
<b>Floyd</b> | for sharpening tools and weapons. Just put what you want sharpened into
<b>Floyd</b> | it and wait.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see a big tacky holy grail here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The goblin comes running after you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The woman notices you and smiles. "Hello there," she says.
<b>Floyd</b> | The genie nods at you.
<b>Floyd</b> | The hippoman says, "Welcome to my humble cave."
<b>Floyd</b> | "I know him," says the gremlin. "He had me trapped in a cage. He is one
<b>Floyd</b> | of them adventurers. He goes around killing monsters."
<b>Floyd</b> | "What?!" shouts the woman.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yeah," says the gremlin "And he once said he thought genies were a
<b>Floyd</b> | bunch of overrated powerless second-class ghosts."
<b>Floyd</b> | "Did he now?" says the genie.
<b>Floyd</b> | The gremlin turns to the hippoman and says, "He also told me hippomen
<b>Floyd</b> | stink and that you were a tub of lard!"
<b>Floyd</b> | The hippoman snorts angrily. He, the woman and the genie approach you.
<b>Floyd</b> | The hippoman punches you in the stomach saying "You disgusting human!"
<b>Floyd</b> | The woman hits you in the head with her placard shouting, "Go away, you
<b>Floyd</b> | monster molester!" The genie lifts you up by the neck with one icy
<b>Floyd</b> | hand, and throws you down on the floor. The three go away from you
<b>Floyd</b> | muttering angrily. The gremlin giggles as you get up.

<b>Floyd</b> | Bumper cave
<b>Floyd</b> | An extremely bright light comes from an exit to the west. There is

<b>Floyd</b> | A table made from human skulls stands near the northeast exit. On the

<b>Floyd</b> | A small round stage stands close to the table. It is apparently made

<b>Floyd</b> | A cat-headed man sits next to her on a throne draped in black leather,

<b>Floyd</b> | A genie floats about a meter above the ground. He looks like a man made

<b>Floyd</b> | stomach rises from a small cloud of icy steam. He holds an ice sabre.
<b>Floyd</b> | A hippoman, half man, half hippo, stands knitting something yellow. He
<b>Floyd</b> | is fat, purple and has two very thick legs. He is wearing your helmet.
<b>Floyd</b> | A young angry-looking woman stands holding a large placard saying "Save

<b>Floyd</b> | The gremlin has climbed quite high up on the wall. He is a small green

<b>Floyd</b> | A large metal chest stands up against a wall. It is closed.
<b>Floyd</b> | A large machine is at the back of the cave. Its mechanisms looks very

<b>Floyd</b> | There is a most horrible sound like two carriages filled with drum sets

<b>Floyd</b> | from a swamp. There is a terrible feeling of being thrown. And there is
<b>Floyd</b> | pain. Lots and lots of pain. You lie still, waiting for the pain to

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Wearily you open your eyes. Turquoise. That's all you can see. It takes

<b>Floyd</b> | It is turquoise sludge that covers your face. And your arm. And, you
<b>Floyd</b> | notice, the rest of your body. You are lying in a pool of the stuff.
<b>Floyd</b> | Looking around a bit you notice you have been thrown into another cave.
<b>Floyd</b> | You open your mouth and spit out some sludge. It is very silent. In
<b>Floyd</b> | fact you cannot hear a sound. Wait a moment. You twist your head to the
<b>Floyd</b> | side (pain, pain, pain) and sludge pours out of your ear. You can hear
<b>Floyd</b> | a dripping sound coming from the southeast.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Note to self," you think. "Do not transport a very large monster into
<b>Floyd</b> | a very small space, when simultaneously occupying that space."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You start trying to get up (PAIN, PAIN, PAIN). You stop trying to get
<b>Floyd</b> | up. You have noticed a piece of metal sticking out of your shoulder.
<b>Floyd</b> | You carefully pull it out. After a moment it dawns on you; this is a
<b>Floyd</b> | piece of the safe. Looking closer at your body you see quite a lot of
<b>Floyd</b> | other pieces of the safe sticking out from it. Enough to build a new
<b>Floyd</b> | small safe from, you estimate. Carefully you begin to pick out the
<b>Floyd</b> | pieces, one by one, and throw them away.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You get up. You clean off the worst of the sludge. You start longing

<b>Floyd</b> | A short lever with a handle sticks out from a wall. The handle has a
<b>Floyd</b> | thin, wide gap, large enough for the fingers of one hand to go through.
<b>Floyd</b> | A metallic pyramid, about half a meter high, sticks up from the cave
<b>Floyd</b> | floor. You once tested a hundred different teleporters, and you

<b>Floyd</b> | models. To use it you just stand on it and shake the lever repeatedly.
<b>Floyd</b> | This particular teleporter seems badly designed though: the lever is
<b>Floyd</b> | far away from it, almost on the other side of the cave.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can hear a low humming coming from the teleporter.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Up from the lever sticks the new magical sword from Adventurer's
<b>Floyd</b> | Emporium. According to the commercial it will start to vibrate when you
<b>Floyd</b> | are close to danger. It is shaking like crazy, but not enough to shake
<b>Floyd</b> | the lever.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see a cage here.

<b>Floyd</b> | A carrot with tiny wings flies around. Its arms and legs look like

<b>Floyd</b> | A large metal chest stands up against a wall. It is open and empty.
<b>Floyd</b> | A large machine is at the back of the cave. Its mechanisms looks very

<b>Floyd</b> | Gigantic cave
<b>Floyd</b> | An extremely bright light comes from an exit to the north. There is

<b>Floyd</b> | A red automat, hundred of meters tall, stands in the middle of the
<b>Floyd</b> | cave. Despite the insane magnitude of the machine, its money-slot and

<b>Floyd</b> | merchandise-slot is also close to the floor, but huge enough to hold a
<b>Floyd</b> | horse. You have come across these automats before. Several companies
<b>Floyd</b> | have recently begun placing them in dangerous places, for adventurers
<b>Floyd</b> | who need equipment. They are easy to use; just buy something. Something
<b>Floyd</b> | is written on the automat next to the buttons.
<b>Floyd</b> | A stone altar stands up against a wall. It is low, shadowy,
<b>Floyd</b> | bloodstained and has runes written on it. Next to it is a huge pile of
<b>Floyd</b> | fish bones.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the altar you can see:
<b>Floyd</b> | A sluggish fish. Its eyes are white and have no pupils. It is crawling

<b>Floyd</b> | An extremely bright light comes from an exit to the west. There is

<b>Floyd</b> | The gremlin has climbed quite high up on the wall. He is a small green

<b>Floyd</b> | A carrot with tiny wings flies around. Its arms and legs look like
<b>Floyd</b> | those of a human, only much smaller. It has no head or face. It is
<b>Floyd</b> | wearing a yellow woolen scarf. A steady shower of shimmering sparks
<b>Floyd</b> | falls from all over its body; each spark disappears before hitting the
<b>Floyd</b> | ground.
<b>Floyd</b> | A large metal chest stands up against a wall. It is open and empty.
<b>Floyd</b> | A large machine is at the back of the cave. Its mechanisms looks very

<b>Floyd</b> | buttons are normal-sized and placed at normal height. The
<b>Floyd</b> | merchandise-slot is also close to the floor, but huge enough to hold a
<b>Floyd</b> | horse. You have come across these automats before. Several companies
<b>Floyd</b> | have recently begun placing them in dangerous places, for adventurers
<b>Floyd</b> | who need equipment. They are easy to use; just buy something. Something
<b>Floyd</b> | is written on the automat next to the buttons.
<b>Floyd</b> | A huge pile of fish bones lies near a wall.

<b>Floyd</b> | A short lever with a handle sticks out from a wall. The handle has a
<b>Floyd</b> | thin, wide gap, large enough for the fingers of one hand to go through.
<b>Floyd</b> | A metallic pyramid, about half a meter high, sticks up from the cave
<b>Floyd</b> | floor. You once tested a hundred different teleporters, and you
<b>Floyd</b> | recognize the pyramid as one of the safest and least complicated
<b>Floyd</b> | models. To use it you just stand on it and shake the lever repeatedly.
<b>Floyd</b> | This particular teleporter seems badly designed though: the lever is
<b>Floyd</b> | far away from it, almost on the other side of the cave.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can hear a low humming coming from the teleporter.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Up from the lever sticks the new magical sword from Adventurer's
<b>Floyd</b> | Emporium. According to the commercial it will start to vibrate when you
<b>Floyd</b> | are close to danger. It is shaking like crazy, but not enough to shake
<b>Floyd</b> | the lever.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see a cage here.

<b>Floyd</b> | The goblin comes running after you.

<b>Floyd</b> | This cave has an exit southeast to the outside, or you could go further

<b>Floyd</b> | A somewhat larger than life-size statue of his holiness One-Hand Jack
<b>Floyd</b> | stands in the middle of the cave. Jack used to be an infamous pirate,
<b>Floyd</b> | but later formed Hoverism, a peaceful religion. The statue holds its
<b>Floyd</b> | left arm out and up, the hook at the end of it just low enough to be

<b>Floyd</b> | An old Hoverist is hovering about a meter above the floor. He is

<b>Floyd</b> | hung some Christmas ornaments on him.
<b>Floyd</b> | Several fragments from the safe are lying here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Though you cannot see it, you know that a Hustlespleen & Poe Coat of

<b>Floyd</b> | You are a product tester for the Adventurer's Consumer Guide, a
<b>Floyd</b> | magazine that reviews all sorts of equipment an adventurer might need
<b>Floyd</b> | for his adventures. Your magazine is highly respected because of the
<b>Floyd</b> | thorough tests you put the equipment through. The tests aren't just
<b>Floyd</b> | done at the magazine's offices. No, the product testers go on actual
<b>Floyd</b> | adventures to test the equipment out in the field. Sometimes you kill
<b>Floyd</b> | an evil overlord; sometimes you rescue a fair maiden. Most of the time,
<b>Floyd</b> | like today, you just go out looking for a treasure in Treasure Cave
<b>Floyd</b> | Mountain, a perfect place for adventures as it contains plenty of
<b>Floyd</b> | caves, treasures, monsters and traps.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you are putting on the soon-to-be-tested magical coat, magical ring
<b>Floyd</b> | and magical helmet, your editor says, "On this mission you'll be having
<b>Floyd</b> | a helper with you."
<b>Floyd</b> | "Really?" you say. You usually work alone.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yeah, but it's part of a test. See, there's this new agency that is
<b>Floyd</b> | renting out sidekicks. We are going to write a review about it. Oh,
<b>Floyd</b> | here he is now."
<b>Floyd</b> | Into your office walks a goblin: a green humanoid creature with pointy
<b>Floyd</b> | ears, about a meter tall. "Hi, you must be my new boss," he says to
<b>Floyd</b> | you.
<b>Floyd</b> | "I guess I am. What is it you're supposed to do, exactly?"
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, I'm very brave and helpful, plus I'm a ferocious killing
<b>Floyd</b> | machine. If you see any kind of monster, or anything at all, and you
<b>Floyd</b> | want it killed, just tell me, and it's toast."
<b>Floyd</b> | "Okay... well, I think we should get going."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You and your new companion are off to Treasure Cave Mountain. Your
<b>Floyd</b> | mission is to return with one really big treasure. Any really big
<b>Floyd</b> | treasure.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you are unfamiliar with interactive fiction, type HELP.
<b>Floyd</b> | If you care, type CREDITS.
<b>Floyd</b> | In this game you can't examine things. Instead use either "look" to see
<b>Floyd</b> | descriptions of the things in the room you are in, or "inventory" to
<b>Floyd</b> | see descriptions of what you are carrying. You also can't use "look
<b>Floyd</b> | inside", "look under", "look behind", "look &lt;direction&gt;" or "search".
<b>Floyd</b> | But you can use "read".
<b>Floyd</b> | To see your inventory without the long descriptions of all you are
<b>Floyd</b> | carrying, type: "inventory short". Or simply: "i s". Or simply: "is".
<b>Floyd</b> | No time passes when you use "look" or "inventory".
<b>Floyd</b> | You communicate by "talk to [whatever]", or by giving commands in this
<b>Floyd</b> | format: "goblin, give me the cow-o-meter".
<b>Floyd</b> | It is possible to put this game in an unwinnable state, but you should
<b>Floyd</b> | be able to figure out when this has happened.
