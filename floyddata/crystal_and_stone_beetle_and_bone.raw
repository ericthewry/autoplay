						<em>Crystal and Stone, Beetle and Bone</em> written by Jenny Brennan.
						<I>Crystal and Stone Beetle and Bone</I> was released in 2007.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Our story begins here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The harvest time is upon the people. Their hard work goes on from early
<b>Floyd</b> | morning until all that must be done is done. The summer has been good
<b>Floyd</b> | and this winter no one will starve. That is what the villagers believe,
<b>Floyd</b> | anyway. In ignorance they have turned from you and cannot see the
<b>Floyd</b> | coming darkness. For them Ignorance is bliss, but refusing to see the
<b>Floyd</b> | truth is no protection against evil.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The young girl that's come to meet you in secret is Lornedei. You watch
<b>Floyd</b> | her treading along the road and when she stops next to the water, you
<b>Floyd</b> | once more feel a glimmer of hope. She is the first child in more than a
<b>Floyd</b> | hundred years that has been born with the old power. The youngest
<b>Floyd</b> | daughter to Lorne and Noki, this innocent girl searches the sky for
<b>Floyd</b> | your presence. She smiles when she senses it and gives you a little
<b>Floyd</b> | wave. She is the last one. The last hope.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei tightens the straps on her rucksack, throws a quick glance
<b>Floyd</b> | back along the road, and makes sure her sandals are fastened properly.
<b>Floyd</b> | Surely she can sense you watching her, but she says nothing. She
<b>Floyd</b> | reaches into her rucksack and brings out some bread. She nibbles on it
<b>Floyd</b> | without much enthusiasm while watching the flowing river, and she waits
<b>Floyd</b> | for you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The girl has the power to "reach" beyond what the eye can see and
<b>Floyd</b> | "heal" what is broken, but she is not strong enough to make a
<b>Floyd</b> | difference. Not without guidance. That is where you come in. As the God
<b>Floyd</b> | of this land, you must guide her. First, you should send her to the
<b>Floyd</b> | unholy stones to see what the world around her is hiding.
<b>Floyd</b> | An Interactive Fantasy.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Aarkland (End of Village Road)
<b>Floyd</b> | This old road, coming from the village, runs north to the edge of the
<b>Floyd</b> | forest. Alongside it to the west is the rushing water of the river
<b>Floyd</b> | Aarkland. The river flows through the forest and divides it in two: To
<b>Floyd</b> | the east is the old forest, and to the west is the forbidden forest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Few people use the road these days, and it is all but overtaken by
<b>Floyd</b> | grass and brush. A seemingly endless field stretches out to the east.
<b>Floyd</b> | Between the swaying grass and the road, a few deformed bushes prepare
<b>Floyd</b> | to invade what remains of the road. A short distance to the southeast
<b>Floyd</b> | is a pile of stones. The stones are barely visible above the grass.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Aarkland river flows past as always.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A whiff of the deformed bushes reaches Lornedei's nose and she waves
<b>Floyd</b> | the unpleasant odor away.

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | You are The almighty, the last of the Gods. Your wish is Lornedei's
<b>Floyd</b> | command and she will do as you ask if it is possible.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When she was born you managed to give her, as your chosen one, the
<b>Floyd</b> | power to heal and to reach into things with her mind. She is young
<b>Floyd</b> | though and you must show her the way. You might be a god but you are
<b>Floyd</b> | not much more than a vague presence in this world.
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei suddenly looks startled.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Master what is this?" A firefly is buzzing around her head. She waves
<b>Floyd</b> | her hand to wave it away when suddenly a small voice pipes up.
<b>Floyd</b> | "No, No, silly girl. I am no harm! I am here to help you must know!"
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei stops waving but she looks dubiously at the tiny creature.
<b>Floyd</b> | Once safe from the terribly waving arm, the firefly stops for a rest on
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei's brow. The tiny voice pipes up again. "I must come, curious
<b>Floyd</b> | am I, and I can help such as you!" Lornedei tries to look up at the fly
<b>Floyd</b> | but all that happens is that her eyes cross. "There is magic here,
<b>Floyd</b> | magic in you girl. I have not sensed magic in a long time, yes!" the
<b>Floyd</b> | fly takes off and starts buzzing around Lornedei's head again. "Strong
<b>Floyd</b> | you are not! Oh, no. That god of yours was stingy in his giving so he
<b>Floyd</b> | was. Pity, pity. You can be stronger though. Sometimes from nature,
<b>Floyd</b> | sometimes from other things. You must know girl, to regain strength
<b>Floyd</b> | that you lose, you must eat. Ah, there are some here, I have searched
<b>Floyd</b> | for these." the fly buzzes off towards the deformed bushes and lands on
<b>Floyd</b> | one of the berries growing there. "Eat these and be strong, do not
<b>Floyd</b> | forget." there is an angry buzzing, a strange grunting sound, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | thud as a white berry, seemingly with a firefly attached on the top,
<b>Floyd</b> | falls to the ground. "Me... Will just.." In an amazing display of
<b>Floyd</b> | over-insectile powers, the fly lifts the berry off the ground. "will
<b>Floyd</b> | just take this." The firefly, along with its booty, disappears with a
<b>Floyd</b> | pop and a flash.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The firefly is available for questioning. It is happy to help. Just
<b>Floyd</b> | type "hint" and it will come.

<b>Floyd</b> | Aarkland (On the Unholy Stones)
<b>Floyd</b> | For as long as Lornedei can remember, she has been told not to go

<b>Floyd</b> | could just be a collection of fieldstones, perhaps from the time when
<b>Floyd</b> | the settlers first prepared the field. Nothing could be more wrong.
<b>Floyd</b> | There are piles of stones in many fields, but none with this kind of

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She hesitates and turns to you. It seems like she wants to say
<b>Floyd</b> | something. She keeps silent and steps up on the platform.
<b>Floyd</b> | The collection of stones is over ten paces from edge to edge. The top
<b>Floyd</b> | has been flattened to create a platform and that is where Lornedei
<b>Floyd</b> | stands. No new stones have been added in several hundred years. Despite
<b>Floyd</b> | the lack of activity, nothing grows near the stones.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | The world around Lornedei fades. She finds herself high up in the air,
<b>Floyd</b> | hovering above a seemingly endless field. She flaps her white wings
<b>Floyd</b> | tentatively at first, but then she catches an upwind and rises.
<b>Floyd</b> | Not far ahead of her is a vast and lush forest, stretching north and
<b>Floyd</b> | northeast. She looks east. Between the field and the endless ocean are
<b>Floyd</b> | a few homes, perhaps a fishing village, and a patchwork of fields. As
<b>Floyd</b> | she hovers far above the field, turning to the south, she can see a
<b>Floyd</b> | road following a river to another village far to the south. It is
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei's own.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She turns west and the forbidden forest, a landscape of gray, stretches
<b>Floyd</b> | out ahead of her. It stretches to the southwest and to the northwest as
<b>Floyd</b> | far as she can see. It is a swirling black and gray mass of mist or
<b>Floyd</b> | smoke, for the most part unbroken except for the occasional tree-top
<b>Floyd</b> | protruding here and there.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She moves closer until she is above the glittering water of the
<b>Floyd</b> | Aarkland river and turns north. She follows the flowing water until it
<b>Floyd</b> | seems to disappear into a large cliff. The two forests meet at the top
<b>Floyd</b> | of the cliff, but the old forest seems to give way more and more so
<b>Floyd</b> | that the border turns northeast towards a distant mountain chain. The
<b>Floyd</b> | river does not seem to appear again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She turns west, soaring above unbroken gray, seeing only the occasional
<b>Floyd</b> | twisted treetop shooting out of the thick mist and a blue sky above.
<b>Floyd</b> | She flies on, across a landscape of gray and black. The mist Swirls
<b>Floyd</b> | here and there, darkens here and there, but never reveals what is
<b>Floyd</b> | below.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then the air seems to thin and she sinks down. She sinks down below the
<b>Floyd</b> | mist. She finds herself racing between twisted tree-trunks and grasping
<b>Floyd</b> | branches. A dry whisper follows her as she loses her orientation.
<b>Floyd</b> | Silent shapes like shadows follow her path. Spirits, hollow-eyed, pale
<b>Floyd</b> | and ragged, open their mouths in rage and longing before they shy away
<b>Floyd</b> | from her. They melt back into the shadows between the trees. Suddenly
<b>Floyd</b> | she is out of the forest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Below her is a barren landscape of sand and broken earth. The forbidden
<b>Floyd</b> | forest surrounds this field of despair, although the sky is clear.
<b>Floyd</b> | Above the mist, to the northeast, she can see a pale silhouette of the
<b>Floyd</b> | mountains. She can see a far distant shade of green to the east, beyond
<b>Floyd</b> | which is a blue horizon.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The same view meets her to the southeast, but to the south, southwest
<b>Floyd</b> | and west, there is only the forbidden forest with its blanket of mist.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She lowers herself until she is just above stony ground. A deep ravine
<b>Floyd</b> | separates the field from the forest to the west. The ravine runs south
<b>Floyd</b> | to north into a misty plain where it disappears out of sight. To the
<b>Floyd</b> | northwest, clinging to the edge of the ravine, there is an old ruin...a
<b>Floyd</b> | castle. Only part of the ruin is visible as the rest of it fades into
<b>Floyd</b> | gray mist.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She turns westward and sinks down in the ravine. Making her way north,
<b>Floyd</b> | the tip of her left wing nearly strokes the far ravine wall. She turns
<b>Floyd</b> | upwards and flies clockwise around the entire castle ruin. Most of the
<b>Floyd</b> | old castle is gone. As she is viewing it from the outside she can see
<b>Floyd</b> | chambers, dungeons and rooms in several levels that are exposed. The
<b>Floyd</b> | rest of the ruin is at the bottom of the ravine. After flying through
<b>Floyd</b> | the mist on the far side of the ruin, she appears at a great wall that
<b>Floyd</b> | separates the castle grounds from the northern wastelands before
<b>Floyd</b> | turning southeast. In the southeast corner of the big desolate field
<b>Floyd</b> | the ground slopes down and turns into a ragged hole in the ground. Heat
<b>Floyd</b> | ripples the air around it. A large fire burns within a ring of stones.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She circles the fire. She is in a hurry, searching for the thing that
<b>Floyd</b> | should be but is no longer. She returns to the ruin. There is a high
<b>Floyd</b> | wall east of the castle and she stops to rest on top of it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The world wavers its way back to reality and Lornedei looks pale and a
<b>Floyd</b> | bit unsteady on her feet.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Too high! Master? If I die and must come back, please do not make me a
<b>Floyd</b> | bird!"There is nothing she can do from here. She may be able to reach a

<b>Floyd</b> | takes her eyes off the road and moves on.
<b>Floyd</b> | The grass grows waist high. Touched by sun, wind, and rain, it

<b>Floyd</b> | those yellow eyes and a deep growl behind the exposed sharp teeth
<b>Floyd</b> | cannot be mistaken for friendliness.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Another mumbled phrase is heard from the girl and the predator's eyes
<b>Floyd</b> | slowly close. The wolf is asleep. The girl kneels while the swirling
<b>Floyd</b> | blue light covers the wolf with healing power. In one quick move, she

<b>Floyd</b> | A constant play of light and shadow goes on around her. The two forests

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The nasty forest has secrets. It might tell you if you look beyond.
<b>Floyd</b> | You must reach inside it to get knowledge girl. So many secrets are
<b>Floyd</b> | everywhere in this forest, and the other forest, leaves and rocks and
<b>Floyd</b> | the beasts living there." The fly buzzes over to a black leaf floating
<b>Floyd</b> | on the river. "This here is not what it seems either." The fly lands on
<b>Floyd</b> | the edge of the leaf and with an angry buzzing, it propels its little
<b>Floyd</b> | ship downstream without another word.

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> |  The leaves look the same on each tree, even though the types of trees
<b>Floyd</b> | are different altogether. It is more like an infestation of these
<b>Floyd</b> | things, these leaves. They are leaves are they not? They grow in
<b>Floyd</b> | clusters that hang down from each limb. They give the entire forest a
<b>Floyd</b> | drooping, weighed down appearance. Each cluster holds somewhere around
<b>Floyd</b> | eight shell-like leaves and each branch holds eight to twelve clusters,
<b>Floyd</b> | depending on the size of the tree. The occasional single leaf grows
<b>Floyd</b> | directly on the black trunk of some of the trees. They look more like a
<b>Floyd</b> | shimmering wart or pimple growing on the scorched bark. The clusters
<b>Floyd</b> | look more and more like colonies of big water bugs clinging to each
<b>Floyd</b> | other in fear of dropping to the ground.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The leaves move, but not by wind. There is a barely perceptible
<b>Floyd</b> | rearrangement within the clusters. A quick adjustment of the leaves
<b>Floyd</b> | takes place and then it is entirely still again. Each slight movement
<b>Floyd</b> | in a cluster creates a dry, scratching, whispering sound. The sound
<b>Floyd</b> | generated by a single cluster of leaves is barely audible, but since
<b>Floyd</b> | some of the clusters are always moving, the resulting sound is a shrill
<b>Floyd</b> | whispering, a scraping, almost a singing. It is a strangely modulated
<b>Floyd</b> | melody that travels from tree to tree through the forest. It varies in

<b>Floyd</b> | fills with a hideous mush that swells and boils as she watches. Flesh
<b>Floyd</b> | grows and shapes itself in the shell into an insect's body. The mush is
<b>Floyd</b> | white with brown and dark red streaks. The nasty mess is swirling
<b>Floyd</b> | around inside the leaf, forming the flesh bit by bit. The shiny wetness
<b>Floyd</b> | dries quickly once the beetle's body takes form inside its shell. A

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | The black beetle is still for a few moments. Sniffing the air for
<b>Floyd</b> | danger. Then suddenly it decides where to go and takes off along one of
<b>Floyd</b> | the paths. Lornedei follows.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Shadows reach for her, imaginary or not, from the growing darkness
<b>Floyd</b> | between the trees, as she moves into the forbidden forest. The beetle
<b>Floyd</b> | is ahead of her, leading on, stopping now and then to find its way. The
<b>Floyd</b> | path twists and changes direction so many times that Lornedei has to
<b>Floyd</b> | rely totally on her glimmering little guide.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei keeps her eye on the bug, but looks around now and then. The
<b>Floyd</b> | trees all look the same. No matter which kind they might have been
<b>Floyd</b> | originally, they are now all black and scorched. Clusters of leaves,
<b>Floyd</b> | singing their strange melody, hang from nearly all of them, some nearly
<b>Floyd</b> | touching the undergrowth. The forest is cold, the air thick, and
<b>Floyd</b> | Cowering under the stare of the shadows, she moves on. The bug leads.
<b>Floyd</b> | It runs ahead, over a dry and cracked puddle of mud, through the
<b>Floyd</b> | hollowed out insides of a dead tree, forward.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The beetle stops. Its antennae wave frantically and it spins around on
<b>Floyd</b> | the ground a couple of times. When Lornedei reaches down to pick it up
<b>Floyd</b> | it quickly unfolds its wings, takes off with a buzzing and disappears
<b>Floyd</b> | among the trees.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Forbidden Forest (Near the Raven Tree)
<b>Floyd</b> | Disappointed, Lornedei looks around.
<b>Floyd</b> | "I think I am lost."
<b>Floyd</b> | The scorched trees tower over anyone and anything unfortunate enough to
<b>Floyd</b> | be here. An air of ill will hangs over the treetops.
<b>Floyd</b> | The gray fog touches the trees highest branches, hiding the sun from
<b>Floyd</b> | view. Two paths lead into the black forest from here.
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei sighs.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An enormous raven sits high up on a blackened branch, surrounded by the
<b>Floyd</b> | bug like leaves. It stares unblinking at Lornedei as she moves around
<b>Floyd</b> | in the crossing. It greets her with a threatening flutter with the
<b>Floyd</b> | wings, a guttural croaking and constant nervous sidestepping on the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | While the beetle is helpless, the bird gets to the eating. Big chunks

<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei takes another step and the bird takes off in the air. It flies
<b>Floyd</b> | in circles in front of her, high up and almost out of sight at times
<b>Floyd</b> | but always close enough for Lornedei to follow. The path winds its way
<b>Floyd</b> | through and around the disturbing shadows of the forbidden forest.
<b>Floyd</b> | Fallen trees and dense undergrowth is constantly in her way and she has
<b>Floyd</b> | to climb over, through, or around these obstacles, while keeping an eye
<b>Floyd</b> | on the bird. It is just ahead and above her. She follows the black
<b>Floyd</b> | bird, expecting the cold grip of the forgotten ones around her ankles
<b>Floyd</b> | at any moment. Images of soul wrenching, flesh ripping, and blood
<b>Floyd</b> | drinking spirits run through her mind. Nothing happens. Exhausted and
<b>Floyd</b> | bruised, with her clothes torn and dusty, she stumbles on.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Something grabs her foot; she loses her balance and falls forward with
<b>Floyd</b> | a painful thud. Frozen in a breathless heap on the ground, she takes a
<b>Floyd</b> | moment to gather her strength as well as her breath. The bird croaks,
<b>Floyd</b> | Light seeps in through her closed eyelids.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She looks up in time to catch a final glimpse of the bird. It
<b>Floyd</b> | disappears into a glowing sunset beyond a desolate field.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Wasteland (Overlooking the Field of Despair)
<b>Floyd</b> | Slowly Lornedei gets up on her feet. Nearly blinded by the light from
<b>Floyd</b> | the dying sun, she inspects the damage. She sighs deeply.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She opens her mouth to speak again but the words never come. She takes
<b>Floyd</b> | in the view of this seemingly empty wasteland in shocked silence for
<b>Floyd</b> | some time. She swallows. A dry wind tugs at her clothing while playing
<b>Floyd</b> | restlessly in the dry ground.
<b>Floyd</b> | Behind her is the forbidden forest. The tree line is sharp as if cut
<b>Floyd</b> | with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the
<b>Floyd</b> | uniform gray ahead.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply
<b>Floyd</b> | the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the
<b>Floyd</b> | field slopes down towards something that she cannot see. On the far
<b>Floyd</b> | side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the
<b>Floyd</b> | dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the
<b>Floyd</b> | forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is
<b>Floyd</b> | cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is
<b>Floyd</b> | an old ruin reflecting the colours of the sun. To the north and
<b>Floyd</b> | northeast, the field continues into the blurred horizon.

<b>Floyd</b> | Wasteland (Overlooking the Field of Despair)

<b>Floyd</b> | with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the
<b>Floyd</b> | uniform gray ahead.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply
<b>Floyd</b> | the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the
<b>Floyd</b> | field slopes down towards something that she cannot see. On the far
<b>Floyd</b> | side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the
<b>Floyd</b> | dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the
<b>Floyd</b> | forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is
<b>Floyd</b> | cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is
<b>Floyd</b> | an old ruin reflecting the colours of the sun. To the north and
<b>Floyd</b> | northeast, the field continues into the blurred horizon.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The harvest time is upon the people. Their hard work goes on from early

<b>Floyd</b> | and this winter no one will starve. That is what the villagers believe,
<b>Floyd</b> | anyway. In ignorance they have turned from you and cannot see the

<b>Floyd</b> | truth is no protection against evil.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The young girl that's come to meet you in secret is Lornedei. You watch
<b>Floyd</b> | her treading along the road and when she stops next to the water, you
<b>Floyd</b> | once more feel a glimmer of hope. She is the first child in more than a
<b>Floyd</b> | hundred years that has been born with the old power. The youngest
<b>Floyd</b> | daughter to Lorne and Noki, this innocent girl searches the sky for
<b>Floyd</b> | your presence. She smiles when she senses it and gives you a little
<b>Floyd</b> | wave. She is the last one. The last hope.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei tightens the straps on her rucksack, throws a quick glance

<b>Floyd</b> | Aarkland (End of Village Road)
<b>Floyd</b> | This old road, coming from the village, runs north to the edge of the
<b>Floyd</b> | forest. Alongside it to the west is the rushing water of the river
<b>Floyd</b> | Aarkland. The river flows through the forest and divides it in two: To
<b>Floyd</b> | the east is the old forest, and to the west is the forbidden forest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Few people use the road these days, and it is all but overtaken by
<b>Floyd</b> | grass and brush. A seemingly endless field stretches out to the east.
<b>Floyd</b> | Between the swaying grass and the road, a few deformed bushes prepare
<b>Floyd</b> | to invade what remains of the road. A short distance to the southeast
<b>Floyd</b> | is a pile of stones. The stones are barely visible above the grass.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Aarkland river flows past as always.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A whiff of the deformed bushes reaches Lornedei's nose and she waves
<b>Floyd</b> | the unpleasant odor away.

<b>Floyd</b> | Aarkland (On the Unholy Stones)
<b>Floyd</b> | For as long as Lornedei can remember, she has been told not to go
<b>Floyd</b> | there. There is nothing strange about the stones at a distance. It
<b>Floyd</b> | could just be a collection of fieldstones, perhaps from the time when
<b>Floyd</b> | the settlers first prepared the field. Nothing could be more wrong.
<b>Floyd</b> | There are piles of stones in many fields, but none with this kind of
<b>Floyd</b> | history.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She hesitates and turns to you. It seems like she wants to say
<b>Floyd</b> | something. She keeps silent and steps up on the platform.
<b>Floyd</b> | The collection of stones is over ten paces from edge to edge. The top
<b>Floyd</b> | has been flattened to create a platform and that is where Lornedei
<b>Floyd</b> | stands. No new stones have been added in several hundred years. Despite
<b>Floyd</b> | the lack of activity, nothing grows near the stones.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There are powers here that make it easier for her to use her magic. You
<b>Floyd</b> | can make her see what hides around her. She will see the world as it
<b>Floyd</b> | is, what hides beyond what the eye can see.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She can go north to the field or northwest back to the dusty road.
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei suddenly looks startled.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Master what is this?" A firefly is buzzing around her head. She waves
<b>Floyd</b> | her hand to wave it away when suddenly a small voice pipes up.
<b>Floyd</b> | "No, No, silly girl. I am no harm! I am here to help you must know!"
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei stops waving but she looks dubiously at the tiny creature.
<b>Floyd</b> | Once safe from the terribly waving arm, the firefly stops for a rest on
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei's brow. The tiny voice pipes up again. "I must come, curious
<b>Floyd</b> | am I, and I can help such as you!" Lornedei tries to look up at the fly
<b>Floyd</b> | but all that happens is that her eyes cross. "There is magic here,
<b>Floyd</b> | magic in you girl. I have not sensed magic in a long time, yes!" the
<b>Floyd</b> | fly takes off and starts buzzing around Lornedei's head again. "Strong
<b>Floyd</b> | you are not! Oh, no. That god of yours was stingy in his giving so he
<b>Floyd</b> | was. Pity, pity. You can be stronger though. Sometimes from nature,
<b>Floyd</b> | sometimes from other things. You must know girl, to regain strength
<b>Floyd</b> | that you lose, you must eat. Ah, there are some here, I have searched
<b>Floyd</b> | for these." the fly buzzes off towards the deformed bushes and lands on
<b>Floyd</b> | one of the berries growing there. "Eat these and be strong, do not
<b>Floyd</b> | forget." there is an angry buzzing, a strange grunting sound, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | thud as a white berry, seemingly with a firefly attached on the top,
<b>Floyd</b> | falls to the ground. "Me... Will just.." In an amazing display of
<b>Floyd</b> | over-insectile powers, the fly lifts the berry off the ground. "will
<b>Floyd</b> | just take this." The firefly, along with its booty, disappears with a
<b>Floyd</b> | pop and a flash.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The firefly is available for questioning. It is happy to help. Just
<b>Floyd</b> | type "hint" and it will come.
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei looks around, biting her lower lip.

<b>Floyd</b> | Aarkland (Billowing Field)
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei hesitates throwing an anxious glance south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Maybe she would prefer to be back in the safe grasp of her kin. If that
<b>Floyd</b> | is the case, she will never tell her God. She does not know why she is
<b>Floyd</b> | here or how easy her mind and flesh may be corrupted, and she may be
<b>Floyd</b> | better off that way.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Very carefully, you give her just the slightest of mental nudges to
<b>Floyd</b> | remove the hesitation from her mind. Not again can you give her a
<b>Floyd</b> | command without letting her choose how to proceed. What she has ahead
<b>Floyd</b> | of her she must do of her own free will as much as possible. Lornedei
<b>Floyd</b> | takes her eyes off the road and moves on.
<b>Floyd</b> | The grass grows waist high. Touched by sun, wind, and rain, it
<b>Floyd</b> | patiently waits for the farmers that will not come. The edge of the old
<b>Floyd</b> | forest lies close by to the north. To the south, a big pile of stones
<b>Floyd</b> | rises above the grass. The road is back west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a low growling coming from the high grass. An injured wolf
<b>Floyd</b> | lies there.
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her
<b>Floyd</b> | ear.

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei shuts her eyes, raising both hands towards the dying animal.
<b>Floyd</b> | She summons her powers and the air starts to shimmer above the wolf. In
<b>Floyd</b> | sudden panic the wolf yelps miserably and tries to get up on its feet,
<b>Floyd</b> | but Lornedei's soft mumbling calms the animal. Still, the stare from
<b>Floyd</b> | those yellow eyes and a deep growl behind the exposed sharp teeth
<b>Floyd</b> | cannot be mistaken for friendliness.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Another mumbled phrase is heard from the girl and the predator's eyes
<b>Floyd</b> | slowly close. The wolf is asleep. The girl kneels while the swirling
<b>Floyd</b> | blue light covers the wolf with healing power. In one quick move, she
<b>Floyd</b> | corrects the broken leg to allow it to heal properly. A long while
<b>Floyd</b> | passes. Then she sits back in the grass, tired but smiling. She lets
<b>Floyd</b> | the healing light dissipate in the air.
<b>Floyd</b> | "All is well Master. I shall call her Deini."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Another long while passes. The air is warm but a slight breeze moves
<b>Floyd</b> | the grass around Lornedei. It sways gently, like waves, across the vast
<b>Floyd</b> | field.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The wolf opens its eyes, blinks, gets up. Lornedei sits on the ground
<b>Floyd</b> | with a confident smile on her lips and her hands in her lap. The
<b>Floyd</b> | beautiful animal stands absolutely still for a moment, meeting the
<b>Floyd</b> | girl's eyes. Then, in a heartbeat, it turns away. It runs along the
<b>Floyd</b> | edge of the forest. It stops near a big tree and turns around to watch
<b>Floyd</b> | the human. It sits down while considering its options.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then suddenly, the wolf that Lornedei named "Deini" comes running back.
<b>Floyd</b> | She smells the human, inspects her carefully, and makes a decision. She
<b>Floyd</b> | puts a cool muzzle in the hand that Lornedei is holding out. Lornedei
<b>Floyd</b> | has gained a friend.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei's magic just dropped by five.

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | The world around Lornedei fades. She finds herself high up in the air,
<b>Floyd</b> | hovering above a seemingly endless field. She flaps her white wings
<b>Floyd</b> | tentatively at first, but then she catches an upwind and rises.
<b>Floyd</b> | Not far ahead of her is a vast and lush forest, stretching north and
<b>Floyd</b> | northeast. She looks east. Between the field and the endless ocean are
<b>Floyd</b> | a few homes, perhaps a fishing village, and a patchwork of fields. As
<b>Floyd</b> | she hovers far above the field, turning to the south, she can see a
<b>Floyd</b> | road following a river to another village far to the south. It is
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei's own.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She turns west and the forbidden forest, a landscape of gray, stretches
<b>Floyd</b> | out ahead of her. It stretches to the southwest and to the northwest as
<b>Floyd</b> | far as she can see. It is a swirling black and gray mass of mist or
<b>Floyd</b> | smoke, for the most part unbroken except for the occasional tree-top
<b>Floyd</b> | protruding here and there.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She moves closer until she is above the glittering water of the
<b>Floyd</b> | Aarkland river and turns north. She follows the flowing water until it
<b>Floyd</b> | seems to disappear into a large cliff. The two forests meet at the top
<b>Floyd</b> | of the cliff, but the old forest seems to give way more and more so
<b>Floyd</b> | that the border turns northeast towards a distant mountain chain. The
<b>Floyd</b> | river does not seem to appear again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She turns west, soaring above unbroken gray, seeing only the occasional
<b>Floyd</b> | twisted treetop shooting out of the thick mist and a blue sky above.
<b>Floyd</b> | She flies on, across a landscape of gray and black. The mist Swirls
<b>Floyd</b> | here and there, darkens here and there, but never reveals what is
<b>Floyd</b> | below.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then the air seems to thin and she sinks down. She sinks down below the
<b>Floyd</b> | mist. She finds herself racing between twisted tree-trunks and grasping
<b>Floyd</b> | branches. A dry whisper follows her as she loses her orientation.
<b>Floyd</b> | Silent shapes like shadows follow her path. Spirits, hollow-eyed, pale
<b>Floyd</b> | and ragged, open their mouths in rage and longing before they shy away
<b>Floyd</b> | from her. They melt back into the shadows between the trees. Suddenly
<b>Floyd</b> | she is out of the forest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Below her is a barren landscape of sand and broken earth. The forbidden
<b>Floyd</b> | forest surrounds this field of despair, although the sky is clear.
<b>Floyd</b> | Above the mist, to the northeast, she can see a pale silhouette of the
<b>Floyd</b> | mountains. She can see a far distant shade of green to the east, beyond
<b>Floyd</b> | which is a blue horizon.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The same view meets her to the southeast, but to the south, southwest
<b>Floyd</b> | and west, there is only the forbidden forest with its blanket of mist.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She lowers herself until she is just above stony ground. A deep ravine
<b>Floyd</b> | separates the field from the forest to the west. The ravine runs south
<b>Floyd</b> | to north into a misty plain where it disappears out of sight. To the
<b>Floyd</b> | northwest, clinging to the edge of the ravine, there is an old ruin...a
<b>Floyd</b> | castle. Only part of the ruin is visible as the rest of it fades into
<b>Floyd</b> | gray mist.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She turns westward and sinks down in the ravine. Making her way north,
<b>Floyd</b> | the tip of her left wing nearly strokes the far ravine wall. She turns
<b>Floyd</b> | upwards and flies clockwise around the entire castle ruin. Most of the
<b>Floyd</b> | old castle is gone. As she is viewing it from the outside she can see
<b>Floyd</b> | chambers, dungeons and rooms in several levels that are exposed. The
<b>Floyd</b> | rest of the ruin is at the bottom of the ravine. After flying through
<b>Floyd</b> | the mist on the far side of the ruin, she appears at a great wall that
<b>Floyd</b> | separates the castle grounds from the northern wastelands before
<b>Floyd</b> | turning southeast. In the southeast corner of the big desolate field
<b>Floyd</b> | the ground slopes down and turns into a ragged hole in the ground. Heat
<b>Floyd</b> | ripples the air around it. A large fire burns within a ring of stones.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She circles the fire. She is in a hurry, searching for the thing that
<b>Floyd</b> | should be but is no longer. She returns to the ruin. There is a high
<b>Floyd</b> | wall east of the castle and she stops to rest on top of it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The world wavers its way back to reality and Lornedei looks pale and a
<b>Floyd</b> | bit unsteady on her feet.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Too high! Master? If I die and must come back, please do not make me a
<b>Floyd</b> | bird!"There is nothing she can do from here. She may be able to reach a
<b>Floyd</b> | distant object, but she can do nothing with it.
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei bites on a nail.

<b>Floyd</b> | heard from the black forest. She moves a little bit closer to the east
<b>Floyd</b> | riverbank.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A constant play of light and shadow goes on around her. The two forests
<b>Floyd</b> | lean towards each other from both sides. The sketched outlines of the
<b>Floyd</b> | two forests against a clear sky create deep shadows, distorted mirrored
<b>Floyd</b> | images, and an illusion of endless depths below.
<b>Floyd</b> | The forbidden forest is to the west and the old forest to the east. The
<b>Floyd</b> | river flows back south and down takes her to the bottom of the river.
<b>Floyd</b> | To the north the river disappears out of sight around a bend, and there
<b>Floyd</b> | is a slight opening in the trees to the east.
<b>Floyd</b> | A tiny voice suddenly pipes up from somewhere in the dark forest. "Most
<b>Floyd</b> | interesting... Most strange this is. Oh, no, nasty bug, go away!" The
<b>Floyd</b> | firefly comes out of the forest in a reckless speed, skids on the
<b>Floyd</b> | surface in front of Lornedei with a shocked screech, gets airborne and
<b>Floyd</b> | settles on her head, clearly exasperated.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Nasty, nasty things. Let me just rest girl, just for a moment."
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei watches the black forest for a moment, waiting for the firefly
<b>Floyd</b> | to calm down. When the little creature talks again, it seems to have
<b>Floyd</b> | regained its composure. It lifts off and starts circling Lornedei.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The nasty forest has secrets. It might tell you if you look beyond.
<b>Floyd</b> | You must reach inside it to get knowledge girl. So many secrets are
<b>Floyd</b> | everywhere in this forest, and the other forest, leaves and rocks and
<b>Floyd</b> | the beasts living there." The fly buzzes over to a black leaf floating
<b>Floyd</b> | on the river. "This here is not what it seems either." The fly lands on
<b>Floyd</b> | the edge of the leaf and with an angry buzzing, it propels its little
<b>Floyd</b> | ship downstream without another word.

<b>Floyd</b> | Hall of Elevation (In the Giant Oak)
<b>Floyd</b> | A soft warm breeze catches Lornedei's hair when she finally reaches a
<b>Floyd</b> | branch. It is, in fact, the first branch she gets to and the only one
<b>Floyd</b> | she can reach. It's as thick as a well-fed pig and she swings one leg
<b>Floyd</b> | over it. She ends up sitting with her face towards the trunk. Above her
<b>Floyd</b> | is an enormous and glittering green ceiling that is the crown of the
<b>Floyd</b> | oak.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She looks up. The endless movements of the countless leaves trick her
<b>Floyd</b> | into swaying with them. That is, until she nearly loses her balance.
<b>Floyd</b> | She grabs the branch and focuses instead on the unmoving trunk. A pale
<b>Floyd</b> | shadow of a smile touches her lips when she quickly glances up at you.
<b>Floyd</b> | The shadow of the big oak trembles on the ground below. The far end of
<b>Floyd</b> | the branch Lornedei is sitting on seems to disappear in a gray mist.
<b>Floyd</b> | The other two branches on this level are just as unreachable for her as
<b>Floyd</b> | the limbs higher up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the trunk in front of her, three holes are lined up in a tidy row.
<b>Floyd</b> | They are apparently inhabited by some kind of worm. She can climb down
<b>Floyd</b> | or go north along the branch.
<b>Floyd</b> | A fat blue worm quickly crawls over to the third hole.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The beetle scrambles out of its confinement. It sits motionless but
<b>Floyd</b> | trembling on Lornedei's shoulder, making a strange hissing noise.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After a moment of that, it scrambles down to the branch, utters that
<b>Floyd</b> | strange hissing again, louder this time. One of the worms sticks its
<b>Floyd</b> | head out and hisses back at the beetle. It makes a very hasty retreat
<b>Floyd</b> | back in the hole though.

<b>Floyd</b> | Slowly, Lornedei looks around this dark clearing. An oppressive gray
<b>Floyd</b> | fog hangs over everything and seems to add weight to the air itself.
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a presence here. Something is waiting among the dark trees.
<b>Floyd</b> | Something sinister.
<b>Floyd</b> | The gray mist hides the sun from sight and there is no way to make out
<b>Floyd</b> | which direction is which.
<b>Floyd</b> | The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across.
<b>Floyd</b> | It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides.
<b>Floyd</b> | A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing.
<b>Floyd</b> | Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to
<b>Floyd</b> | suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way
<b>Floyd</b> | up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs
<b>Floyd</b> | are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow
<b>Floyd</b> | in a loose circle around the oak and the altar.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house.
<b>Floyd</b> | On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The great roots under the giant oak have slid aside revealing a

<b>Floyd</b> | A greenish fog seeps out of the darkness between the trees. Lazily it

<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei moves a strand of hair from her face and puts it behind her

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Shadows reach for her, imaginary or not, from the growing darkness

<b>Floyd</b> | is ahead of her, leading on, stopping now and then to find its way. The
<b>Floyd</b> | path twists and changes direction so many times that Lornedei has to
<b>Floyd</b> | rely totally on her glimmering little guide.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei keeps her eye on the bug, but looks around now and then. The

<b>Floyd</b> | originally, they are now all black and scorched. Clusters of leaves,
<b>Floyd</b> | singing their strange melody, hang from nearly all of them, some nearly
<b>Floyd</b> | touching the undergrowth. The forest is cold, the air thick, and
<b>Floyd</b> | Cowering under the stare of the shadows, she moves on. The bug leads.
<b>Floyd</b> | It runs ahead, over a dry and cracked puddle of mud, through the
<b>Floyd</b> | hollowed out insides of a dead tree, forward.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The beetle stops. Its antennae wave frantically and it spins around on
<b>Floyd</b> | the ground a couple of times. When Lornedei reaches down to pick it up
<b>Floyd</b> | it quickly unfolds its wings, takes off with a buzzing and disappears
<b>Floyd</b> | among the trees.

<b>Floyd</b> | The scorched trees tower over anyone and anything unfortunate enough to

<b>Floyd</b> | The gray fog touches the trees highest branches, hiding the sun from

<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei sighs.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An enormous raven sits high up on a blackened branch, surrounded by the
<b>Floyd</b> | bug like leaves. It stares unblinking at Lornedei as she moves around

<b>Floyd</b> | from the tree and drops in a cloud of dirt between the bug and the safe

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She opens her mouth to speak again but the words never come. She takes
<b>Floyd</b> | in the view of this seemingly empty wasteland in shocked silence for
<b>Floyd</b> | some time. She swallows. A dry wind tugs at her clothing while playing
<b>Floyd</b> | restlessly in the dry ground.
<b>Floyd</b> | Behind her is the forbidden forest. The tree line is sharp as if cut
<b>Floyd</b> | with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the
<b>Floyd</b> | uniform gray ahead.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply
<b>Floyd</b> | the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the

<b>Floyd</b> | side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the
<b>Floyd</b> | dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the
<b>Floyd</b> | forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is
<b>Floyd</b> | cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is
<b>Floyd</b> | an old ruin reflecting the colours of the sun. To the north and

<b>Floyd</b> | The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across.
<b>Floyd</b> | It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides.
<b>Floyd</b> | A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing.
<b>Floyd</b> | Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to
<b>Floyd</b> | suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way
<b>Floyd</b> | up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs

<b>Floyd</b> | in a loose circle around the oak and the altar.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house.
<b>Floyd</b> | On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The great roots under the giant oak have slid aside revealing a
<b>Floyd</b> | passage.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The sleepwalker is here, spinning slowly.
<b>Floyd</b> | Black smoke seeps out of the darkness between the trees. The smoke
<b>Floyd</b> | gathers itself until a dark pillar of smoke is formed. In erratic,
<b>Floyd</b> | twitching moves, it comes closer.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It stops next to the staring Lornedei. It starts to turn slowly,

<b>Floyd</b> | "The maker of horrors at night. The roaming nightmare. I thought they

<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei frowns. She seems to be listening.

<b>Floyd</b> | just above ground level. It spins around its own axis like a slow
<b>Floyd</b> | motion whirlwind.
<b>Floyd</b> | There is an angry buzzing from nearby. Lornedei looks around,
<b>Floyd</b> | mystified.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Pft, which is it, oh smelly it is. Stubborn, umpf, thing." Suddenly,
<b>Floyd</b> | the firefly comes out of the opening to the stone house, dragging a
<b>Floyd</b> | piece of straw. One end of it touches the ground while the other end,
<b>Floyd</b> | with the firefly in unsteady flight through the air, is at level with
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei's knees. "Hiya!" With a terrible boost of tiny wings, the fly
<b>Floyd</b> | gets the straw totally off the ground and stays hovering at eye level.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh dear, you are back." The fly and the straw, despite intense
<b>Floyd</b> | buzzing, starts to sink. Quickly, Lornedei grabs the straw and stops it
<b>Floyd</b> | from falling.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Phew! Thankee Girl. Let me rest. Was waiting for you." Lornedei sticks
<b>Floyd</b> | the end of the straw in her hair so that the other end sticks out in
<b>Floyd</b> | front of her face. After a moment, the fly starts pacing the piece of
<b>Floyd</b> | straw.
<b>Floyd</b> | "You were in the smoke were you not? I feared you being lost Girl. Oh,
<b>Floyd</b> | dear. I must tell a story now. About a little boy." Lornedei sits down
<b>Floyd</b> | on the ground to listen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "He is an ugly one, if you can say so about a spirit. He was not always
<b>Floyd</b> | so. He was a boy once, born in a village not far from yours. That was a
<b>Floyd</b> | long time ago you see. An odd child he was, yes he was. He sat by the
<b>Floyd</b> | pond for much time, lost in the sight of his own face in the water,
<b>Floyd</b> | catching..." the fly stops pacing for a moment and seems to shudder. "I
<b>Floyd</b> | heard from rumor I did don't you know, He caught fireflies and he... He
<b>Floyd</b> | pulled...Oh, dear, I will not speak of that. He was wicked! Then his
<b>Floyd</b> | parents died. He was alone and he took care of himself. How, no one
<b>Floyd</b> | could tell, as he was still only a little boy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then the magician came. The villagers were relieved to see the boy go
<b>Floyd</b> | with him, and no one knows where they went. For many years the boy was
<b>Floyd</b> | gone, yes he was. When he came back, a young man with riches and fancy
<b>Floyd</b> | ways, he moved in to the old home of his family, and said he had gotten
<b>Floyd</b> | rich from trade in the far lands and wished to set up business in his
<b>Floyd</b> | home village." The firefly makes an angry buzzing and starts pacing the
<b>Floyd</b> | straw again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I must make this story of less length I believe. He did not make trade
<b>Floyd</b> | honestly, tricks he had, power he had gained and fooled the villagers
<b>Floyd</b> | he did, and rose to a man of importance despite him being still young.
<b>Floyd</b> | Then his gaze fell on the merchant's daughter, and he wished her for
<b>Floyd</b> | himself. There was nothing but desire in his mind and when the girl's
<b>Floyd</b> | father refused him the still too young girl, a spell was cast. With
<b>Floyd</b> | magic he tried to force her to him, but something went wrong, very
<b>Floyd</b> | wrong."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The spell he cast was powerful. The girl ran from her father in
<b>Floyd</b> | desperation one night, threw herself on a horse and rode for her love.
<b>Floyd</b> | She was in a hurry and fell. The girl was several years younger than
<b>Floyd</b> | you Girl, and the Elder's knew something was amiss. They traced the
<b>Floyd</b> | magic spell to Raccdaha.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Elder's council banished him from the village and from his own body
<b>Floyd</b> | in the ancient sentence of severance. Death but no rest. A very cruel
<b>Floyd</b> | punishment and Raccdaha was in fact the last one they kept in the House
<b>Floyd</b> | of Penance. He became one of the forgotten ones, chased into the vast
<b>Floyd</b> | forest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He did not remain forgotten though. He remembered his name as some of
<b>Floyd</b> | them might if they are strong enough. He grew strong. The hatred he
<b>Floyd</b> | felt poisoned big parts of the old forest and gave some kind of life to
<b>Floyd</b> | the other forgotten souls that dwelled there.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He fed the spirits with lies and promises of life. When they finally
<b>Floyd</b> | felt the same rage as him, he fed on their collective hatred and he
<b>Floyd</b> | could possess a poor wanderer's body for a while. Before his temporary
<b>Floyd</b> | body was used up, he joined the light bearers without them knowing.
<b>Floyd</b> | Their numbers started to decrease until there was very few left. He
<b>Floyd</b> | spread lies. The people grew afraid of magic, and the remaining light
<b>Floyd</b> | bearers had only one place to go. From their castle in the field of
<b>Floyd</b> | Unification, they tried to maintain the three great oaks for many
<b>Floyd</b> | years, but the day came when they had to flee even that haven. Me,
<b>Floyd</b> | cannot tell where they fled, or how. Perhaps if you go there, the place
<b>Floyd</b> | is now the field of despair, you could find knowledge. Me, yes me I
<b>Floyd</b> | don't know the rest of this story, only that Raccdaha came to rest
<b>Floyd</b> | somewhere, not able to move on, not able to live. I believe that he may
<b>Floyd</b> | be guarding the entrance to somewhere where he cannot go, waiting."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The firefly is quiet for a long moment. Then it walks over to the end
<b>Floyd</b> | of the straw and with a powerful buzzing, the straw is dislodged from
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei's hair. The fly pipes up again. "I will be off. Good luck
<b>Floyd</b> | Girl, he may be strong but remember that he is only a big foolish and
<b>Floyd</b> | vain child." The fly and the straw disappear with a flash, leaving a
<b>Floyd</b> | scent of burnt straw in the air.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Greetings Almighty! Allow me to tell you about your world,
<b>Floyd</b> | Aarkland."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Our story begins here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The harvest time is upon the people. Their hard work goes on from
<b>Floyd</b> | early morning until all that must be done is done. The summer has been
<b>Floyd</b> | good and this winter no one will starve. That is what the villagers
<b>Floyd</b> | believe, anyway. In ignorance they have turned from you and cannot see
<b>Floyd</b> | the coming darkness. For them Ignorance is bliss, but refusing to see
<b>Floyd</b> | the truth is no protection against evil.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The young girl that's come to meet you in secret is Lornedei. You
<b>Floyd</b> | watch her treading along the road and when she stops next to the
<b>Floyd</b> | water, you once more feel a glimmer of hope. She is the first child in
<b>Floyd</b> | more than a hundred years that has been born with the old power. The
<b>Floyd</b> | youngest daughter to Lorne and Noki, this innocent girl searches the
<b>Floyd</b> | sky for your presence. She smiles when she senses it and gives you a
<b>Floyd</b> | little wave. She is the last one. The last hope.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei tightens the straps on her rucksack, throws a quick glance
<b>Floyd</b> | back along the road, and makes sure her sandals are fastened properly.
<b>Floyd</b> | Surely she can sense you watching her, but she says nothing. She
<b>Floyd</b> | reaches into her rucksack and brings out some bread. She nibbles on it
<b>Floyd</b> | without much enthusiasm while watching the flowing river, and she
<b>Floyd</b> | waits for you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The girl has the power to "reach" beyond what the eye can see and
<b>Floyd</b> | "heal" what is broken, but she is not strong enough to make a
<b>Floyd</b> | difference. Not without guidance. That is where you come in. As the
<b>Floyd</b> | God of this land, you must guide her. First, you should send her to
<b>Floyd</b> | the unholy stones to see what the world around her is hiding.

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Aarkland (End of Village Road)</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | This old road, coming from the village, runs north to the edge of the
<b>Floyd</b> | forest. Alongside it to the west is the rushing water of the river
<b>Floyd</b> | Aarkland. The river flows through the forest and divides it in two: To
<b>Floyd</b> | the east is the old forest, and to the west is the forbidden forest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Few people use the road these days, and it is all but overtaken by
<b>Floyd</b> | grass and brush. A seemingly endless field stretches out to the east.
<b>Floyd</b> | Between the swaying grass and the road, a few deformed bushes prepare
<b>Floyd</b> | to invade what remains of the road. A short distance to the southeast
<b>Floyd</b> | is a pile of stones. The stones are barely visible above the grass.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Aarkland river flows past as always.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A whiff of the deformed bushes reaches Lornedei's nose and she waves
<b>Floyd</b> | the unpleasant odor away.

<b>Floyd</b> | Hall of Severance
<b>Floyd</b> | The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across.
<b>Floyd</b> | It is surrounded by the forbidden forest on all sides.
<b>Floyd</b> | A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing.
<b>Floyd</b> | Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to
<b>Floyd</b> | suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way
<b>Floyd</b> | up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs
<b>Floyd</b> | are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow
<b>Floyd</b> | in a loose circle around the oak and the altar.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house.
<b>Floyd</b> | On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden
<b>Floyd</b> | forest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The great roots under the giant oak have slid aside revealing a
<b>Floyd</b> | passage.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The sleepwalker is here, spinning slowly.
<b>Floyd</b> | Black smoke seeps out of the darkness between the trees. The smoke
<b>Floyd</b> | gathers itself until a dark pillar of smoke is formed. In erratic,
<b>Floyd</b> | twitching moves, it comes closer.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It stops next to the staring Lornedei. It starts to turn slowly,
<b>Floyd</b> | releasing veils of broken smoke from its ragged surface. They dissolve
<b>Floyd</b> | in the air and new ones form to take their place.

<b>Floyd</b> | She looks terrified but she decides to trust your judgment. She walks

<b>Floyd</b> | the nightmare stops spinning and Lornedei appears on the other side.
<b>Floyd</b> | She looks at you with gray eyes and an uncanny smile on her lips.
<b>Floyd</b> | There is an angry buzzing from nearby. Lornedei looks around,
<b>Floyd</b> | mystified.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Pft, which is it, oh smelly it is. Stubborn, umpf, thing." Suddenly,
<b>Floyd</b> | the firefly comes out of the opening to the stone house, dragging a
<b>Floyd</b> | piece of straw. One end of it touches the ground while the other end,
<b>Floyd</b> | with the firefly in unsteady flight through the air, is at level with
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei's knees. "Hiya!" With a terrible boost of tiny wings, the fly
<b>Floyd</b> | gets the straw totally off the ground and stays hovering at eye level.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh dear, you are back." The fly and the straw, despite intense
<b>Floyd</b> | buzzing, starts to sink. Quickly, Lornedei grabs the straw and stops it
<b>Floyd</b> | from falling.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Phew! Thankee Girl. Let me rest. Was waiting for you." Lornedei sticks
<b>Floyd</b> | the end of the straw in her hair so that the other end sticks out in
<b>Floyd</b> | front of her face. After a moment, the fly starts pacing the piece of
<b>Floyd</b> | straw.
<b>Floyd</b> | "You were in the smoke were you not? I feared you being lost Girl. Oh,
<b>Floyd</b> | dear. I must tell a story now. About a little boy." Lornedei sits down
<b>Floyd</b> | on the ground to listen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "He is an ugly one, if you can say so about a spirit. He was not always
<b>Floyd</b> | so. He was a boy once, born in a village not far from yours. That was a
<b>Floyd</b> | long time ago you see. An odd child he was, yes he was. He sat by the
<b>Floyd</b> | pond for much time, lost in the sight of his own face in the water,
<b>Floyd</b> | catching..." the fly stops pacing for a moment and seems to shudder. "I
<b>Floyd</b> | heard from rumor I did don't you know, He caught fireflies and he... He
<b>Floyd</b> | pulled...Oh, dear, I will not speak of that. He was wicked! Then his
<b>Floyd</b> | parents died. He was alone and he took care of himself. How, no one
<b>Floyd</b> | could tell, as he was still only a little boy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then the magician came. The villagers were relieved to see the boy go
<b>Floyd</b> | with him, and no one knows where they went. For many years the boy was
<b>Floyd</b> | gone, yes he was. When he came back, a young man with riches and fancy
<b>Floyd</b> | ways, he moved in to the old home of his family, and said he had gotten
<b>Floyd</b> | rich from trade in the far lands and wished to set up business in his
<b>Floyd</b> | home village." The firefly makes an angry buzzing and starts pacing the
<b>Floyd</b> | straw again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I must make this story of less length I believe. He did not make trade
<b>Floyd</b> | honestly, tricks he had, power he had gained and fooled the villagers
<b>Floyd</b> | he did, and rose to a man of importance despite him being still young.
<b>Floyd</b> | Then his gaze fell on the merchant's daughter, and he wished her for
<b>Floyd</b> | himself. There was nothing but desire in his mind and when the girl's
<b>Floyd</b> | father refused him the still too young girl, a spell was cast. With
<b>Floyd</b> | magic he tried to force her to him, but something went wrong, very
<b>Floyd</b> | wrong."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The spell he cast was powerful. The girl ran from her father in
<b>Floyd</b> | desperation one night, threw herself on a horse and rode for her love.
<b>Floyd</b> | She was in a hurry and fell. The girl was several years younger than
<b>Floyd</b> | you Girl, and the Elder's knew something was amiss. They traced the
<b>Floyd</b> | magic spell to Raccdaha.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Elder's council banished him from the village and from his own body
<b>Floyd</b> | in the ancient sentence of severance. Death but no rest. A very cruel
<b>Floyd</b> | punishment and Raccdaha was in fact the last one they kept in the House
<b>Floyd</b> | of Penance. He became one of the forgotten ones, chased into the vast
<b>Floyd</b> | forest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He did not remain forgotten though. He remembered his name as some of
<b>Floyd</b> | them might if they are strong enough. He grew strong. The hatred he
<b>Floyd</b> | felt poisoned big parts of the old forest and gave some kind of life to
<b>Floyd</b> | the other forgotten souls that dwelled there.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He fed the spirits with lies and promises of life. When they finally
<b>Floyd</b> | felt the same rage as him, he fed on their collective hatred and he
<b>Floyd</b> | could possess a poor wanderer's body for a while. Before his temporary
<b>Floyd</b> | body was used up, he joined the light bearers without them knowing.
<b>Floyd</b> | Their numbers started to decrease until there was very few left. He
<b>Floyd</b> | spread lies. The people grew afraid of magic, and the remaining light
<b>Floyd</b> | bearers had only one place to go. From their castle in the field of
<b>Floyd</b> | Unification, they tried to maintain the three great oaks for many
<b>Floyd</b> | years, but the day came when they had to flee even that haven. Me,
<b>Floyd</b> | cannot tell where they fled, or how. Perhaps if you go there, the place
<b>Floyd</b> | is now the field of despair, you could find knowledge. Me, yes me I
<b>Floyd</b> | don't know the rest of this story, only that Raccdaha came to rest
<b>Floyd</b> | somewhere, not able to move on, not able to live. I believe that he may
<b>Floyd</b> | be guarding the entrance to somewhere where he cannot go, waiting."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The firefly is quiet for a long moment. Then it walks over to the end
<b>Floyd</b> | of the straw and with a powerful buzzing, the straw is dislodged from
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei's hair. The fly pipes up again. "I will be off. Good luck
<b>Floyd</b> | Girl, he may be strong but remember that he is only a big foolish and
<b>Floyd</b> | vain child." The fly and the straw disappear with a flash, leaving a
<b>Floyd</b> | scent of burnt straw in the air.
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei is muttering to herself.
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei turns her head slowly from side to side, dazed. She blinks.

<b>Floyd</b> | with a knife at creation, separating the blackened forest from the
<b>Floyd</b> | uniform gray ahead.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The horizon ahead is strangely blurred. If from dust, mist or simply
<b>Floyd</b> | the uncertainty of distance is hard to tell from here. In the east, the
<b>Floyd</b> | field slopes down towards something that she cannot see. On the far
<b>Floyd</b> | side of that, the forest continues. In the opposite direction, the
<b>Floyd</b> | dying sun has set the horizon in flames above the gray covering the
<b>Floyd</b> | forbidden forest on that side. On this side of the forest, the land is
<b>Floyd</b> | cut, cracked, dropping down into a ravine. In the northwest, there is
<b>Floyd</b> | an old ruin reflecting the colours of the sun. To the north and
<b>Floyd</b> | northeast, the field continues into the blurred horizon.

<b>Floyd</b> | The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across.

<b>Floyd</b> | A giant black oak stands in solitude in the middle of the clearing.
<b>Floyd</b> | Many of its roots stick out of the ground like snakes arching to
<b>Floyd</b> | suffocate their prey. Steps are cut in the oak to provide an easy way
<b>Floyd</b> | up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs
<b>Floyd</b> | are still rooted in the dead soil, and more of the deformed bushes grow
<b>Floyd</b> | in a loose circle around the oak and the altar.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house.
<b>Floyd</b> | On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden
<b>Floyd</b> | forest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The great roots under the giant oak have slid aside revealing a
<b>Floyd</b> | passage.
<b>Floyd</b> | There is an angry buzzing from nearby. Lornedei looks around,
<b>Floyd</b> | mystified.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Pft, which is it, oh smelly it is. Stubborn, umpf, thing." Suddenly,
<b>Floyd</b> | the firefly comes out of the opening to the stone house, dragging a
<b>Floyd</b> | piece of straw. One end of it touches the ground while the other end,
<b>Floyd</b> | with the firefly in unsteady flight through the air, is at level with
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei's knees. "Hiya!" With a terrible boost of tiny wings, the fly
<b>Floyd</b> | gets the straw totally off the ground and stays hovering at eye level.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh dear, you are back." The fly and the straw, despite intense
<b>Floyd</b> | buzzing, starts to sink. Quickly, Lornedei grabs the straw and stops it
<b>Floyd</b> | from falling.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Phew! Thankee Girl. Let me rest. Was waiting for you." Lornedei sticks
<b>Floyd</b> | the end of the straw in her hair so that the other end sticks out in
<b>Floyd</b> | front of her face. After a moment, the fly starts pacing the piece of
<b>Floyd</b> | straw.
<b>Floyd</b> | "You were in the smoke were you not? I feared you being lost Girl. Oh,
<b>Floyd</b> | dear. I must tell a story now. About a little boy." Lornedei sits down
<b>Floyd</b> | on the ground to listen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "He is an ugly one, if you can say so about a spirit. He was not always
<b>Floyd</b> | so. He was a boy once, born in a village not far from yours. That was a
<b>Floyd</b> | long time ago you see. An odd child he was, yes he was. He sat by the
<b>Floyd</b> | pond for much time, lost in the sight of his own face in the water,
<b>Floyd</b> | catching..." the fly stops pacing for a moment and seems to shudder. "I
<b>Floyd</b> | heard from rumor I did don't you know, He caught fireflies and he... He
<b>Floyd</b> | pulled...Oh, dear, I will not speak of that. He was wicked! Then his
<b>Floyd</b> | parents died. He was alone and he took care of himself. How, no one
<b>Floyd</b> | could tell, as he was still only a little boy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then the magician came. The villagers were relieved to see the boy go
<b>Floyd</b> | with him, and no one knows where they went. For many years the boy was
<b>Floyd</b> | gone, yes he was. When he came back, a young man with riches and fancy
<b>Floyd</b> | ways, he moved in to the old home of his family, and said he had gotten
<b>Floyd</b> | rich from trade in the far lands and wished to set up business in his
<b>Floyd</b> | home village." The firefly makes an angry buzzing and starts pacing the
<b>Floyd</b> | straw again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I must make this story of less length I believe. He did not make trade
<b>Floyd</b> | honestly, tricks he had, power he had gained and fooled the villagers
<b>Floyd</b> | he did, and rose to a man of importance despite him being still young.
<b>Floyd</b> | Then his gaze fell on the merchant's daughter, and he wished her for
<b>Floyd</b> | himself. There was nothing but desire in his mind and when the girl's
<b>Floyd</b> | father refused him the still too young girl, a spell was cast. With
<b>Floyd</b> | magic he tried to force her to him, but something went wrong, very
<b>Floyd</b> | wrong."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The spell he cast was powerful. The girl ran from her father in
<b>Floyd</b> | desperation one night, threw herself on a horse and rode for her love.
<b>Floyd</b> | She was in a hurry and fell. The girl was several years younger than
<b>Floyd</b> | you Girl, and the Elder's knew something was amiss. They traced the
<b>Floyd</b> | magic spell to Raccdaha.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Elder's council banished him from the village and from his own body
<b>Floyd</b> | in the ancient sentence of severance. Death but no rest. A very cruel
<b>Floyd</b> | punishment and Raccdaha was in fact the last one they kept in the House
<b>Floyd</b> | of Penance. He became one of the forgotten ones, chased into the vast
<b>Floyd</b> | forest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He did not remain forgotten though. He remembered his name as some of
<b>Floyd</b> | them might if they are strong enough. He grew strong. The hatred he
<b>Floyd</b> | felt poisoned big parts of the old forest and gave some kind of life to
<b>Floyd</b> | the other forgotten souls that dwelled there.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He fed the spirits with lies and promises of life. When they finally
<b>Floyd</b> | felt the same rage as him, he fed on their collective hatred and he
<b>Floyd</b> | could possess a poor wanderer's body for a while. Before his temporary
<b>Floyd</b> | body was used up, he joined the light bearers without them knowing.
<b>Floyd</b> | Their numbers started to decrease until there was very few left. He
<b>Floyd</b> | spread lies. The people grew afraid of magic, and the remaining light
<b>Floyd</b> | bearers had only one place to go. From their castle in the field of
<b>Floyd</b> | Unification, they tried to maintain the three great oaks for many
<b>Floyd</b> | years, but the day came when they had to flee even that haven. Me,
<b>Floyd</b> | cannot tell where they fled, or how. Perhaps if you go there, the place
<b>Floyd</b> | is now the field of despair, you could find knowledge. Me, yes me I
<b>Floyd</b> | don't know the rest of this story, only that Raccdaha came to rest
<b>Floyd</b> | somewhere, not able to move on, not able to live. I believe that he may
<b>Floyd</b> | be guarding the entrance to somewhere where he cannot go, waiting."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The firefly is quiet for a long moment. Then it walks over to the end
<b>Floyd</b> | of the straw and with a powerful buzzing, the straw is dislodged from
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei's hair. The fly pipes up again. "I will be off. Good luck
<b>Floyd</b> | Girl, he may be strong but remember that he is only a big foolish and
<b>Floyd</b> | vain child." The fly and the straw disappear with a flash, leaving a
<b>Floyd</b> | scent of burnt straw in the air.
<b>Floyd</b> | The sleepwalker comes charging out of the forest in a hurry. It stops
<b>Floyd</b> | next to Lornedei, disposing of sand, leaves and sticks, dead grass and
<b>Floyd</b> | not just a little dry soil.
<b>Floyd</b> | The wandering nightmare crashes out from the black forest. It swirls up
<b>Floyd</b> | dust and dry grass on its erratic route through the dead grass. It
<b>Floyd</b> | twitches past the altar and stops near the black oak.
<b>Floyd</b> | The beetle squirms its way out of Lornedei's grasp and drops to the
<b>Floyd</b> | ground. It runs off, climbs up on the stone well, climbs back down,
<b>Floyd</b> | crawls through the bushes and seems to inspect the stone house, to
<b>Floyd</b> | finally stop at one of the paths.

<b>Floyd</b> | The clearing is almost perfectly round and thirty or so paces across.

<b>Floyd</b> | up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A stone altar stands in the shadow of the big oak. Dry grass and shrubs

<b>Floyd</b> | in a loose circle around the oak and the altar.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An old stone well gurgles softly not far from a crumbling stone house.
<b>Floyd</b> | On the other side of the clearing, three paths lead into the forbidden

<b>Floyd</b> | blue spark appear. It turns to red as she focuses on it, and then she
<b>Floyd</b> | blows it towards her little patch of garden.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The wind suddenly changes direction. It seems to come from everywhere
<b>Floyd</b> | now, focusing on the thorn that slowly grows out of the ground, feeding
<b>Floyd</b> | it. Lornedei looks up. The mist follows the wind, billowing like clouds
<b>Floyd</b> | towards the new tree. A turmoil of gray soon covers the entire field,
<b>Floyd</b> | tightens, grows heavy, and darkness falls.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The single thorn grows, pointing straight up towards the mist, and the
<b>Floyd</b> | ground seems restless under Lornedei's feet. The mist sinks further to
<b>Floyd</b> | meet the thorn, a greasy black spike, taller than Lornedei now and
<b>Floyd</b> | growing still. A small slit opens up at the base of the spike. it oozes
<b>Floyd</b> | a black liquid before a smaller spike is thrust straight out of it,
<b>Floyd</b> | barely missing Lornedei.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | More slits appear and more of these spiked branches come to be. The
<b>Floyd</b> | "tree" continues to grow. The base is now two paces wide and suddenly
<b>Floyd</b> | the earth cracks around it. The spikes, more than thirty now, reach out
<b>Floyd</b> | several paces in every direction, twisting and deforming as they grow.
<b>Floyd</b> | The glistening black skin cracks and oozes more black sap, and thorns
<b>Floyd</b> | starts to grow from these as well.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The crack in the stone widens, but the spike clings to the rock that
<b>Floyd</b> | isn't moving. It doesn't lose its grip as the spike grows down more
<b>Floyd</b> | than up, creating an enormous pillar going down in the mist and out of
<b>Floyd</b> | sight. The crack widens further and the ground shakes violently. With
<b>Floyd</b> | an enormous rumble and screaming stone, everything north of the spike
<b>Floyd</b> | falls out of sight in the deepening mist.
<b>Floyd</b> | At the same time in the Hall of Unification, a lush oak shudders as
<b>Floyd</b> | gray mist darkens the sky. In the village, the ground trembles and the
<b>Floyd</b> | blacksmith tries in vain to calm the horse he is putting new shoes on.

<b>Floyd</b> | They are nothing but diffuse memories of this chamber as it was, as it
<b>Floyd</b> | used to be, but the tension in the group is clear.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Flickering torches on the walls light up the chamber, creating illusive
<b>Floyd</b> | shadows across frightened faces. The silent spirits seem to hesitate.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | They talk hastily among themselves, casting nervous looks into the
<b>Floyd</b> | mirror and over their shoulders. The mirror in this vision is whole and
<b>Floyd</b> | shows a picture of a giant golden oak. The image is fading with each
<b>Floyd</b> | breath. Several of the people in the crowd stagger as if the floor
<b>Floyd</b> | itself is moving. An old man raises a staff towards the mirror,
<b>Floyd</b> | uttering a string of words that catch the attention of the group. A

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He takes a step towards the mirror but then he stops. Something that
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei is unable to see looms over him. His eyes widen in horror and
<b>Floyd</b> | his mouth opens in a silent scream. He raises his staff against the
<b>Floyd</b> | oncoming threat with a thin shaking hand. He knows the end is close as
<b>Floyd</b> | a shadow falls over his pale face. Several long moments he stands
<b>Floyd</b> | still, facing the danger while speaking words that cannot be heard,
<b>Floyd</b> | holding the staff in front of him. The horror in his eyes grows with
<b>Floyd</b> | each meaningless attack.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | His back straightens as the answer comes to him. Instead of fighting a
<b>Floyd</b> | futile battle, he turns to the mirror. He swings his staff with full
<b>Floyd</b> | force at the mirror. The glittering image disappears.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei lowers her hand when the vision explodes in a shower of

<b>Floyd</b> | A sparkling light flares up around it. The light grows stronger and
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei has to throw her hands up in front of her face to keep the
<b>Floyd</b> | blinding light from her eyes.
<b>Floyd</b> | As she steps back, she stumbles on the pile of bones and drops hard on
<b>Floyd</b> | the marble.
<b>Floyd</b> | A roar echoes in the chamber and the floor shakes.
<b>Floyd</b> | Raccdaha is moving away from Lornedei, trying to back away from the
<b>Floyd</b> | small creature of light.
<b>Floyd</b> | The spider is growing. Soon it is doubling, tripling, and quadrupling
<b>Floyd</b> | its size, becoming brighter each second. It glows furiously, the light
<b>Floyd</b> | pulsating as it keeps growing.
<b>Floyd</b> | the roaring increases and turns from rage into fear. Raccdaha is trying
<b>Floyd</b> | to shield itself from the light, but the light is everywhere. It throws
<b>Floyd</b> | its arms at the spider to crush it. It gets a hold of one leg of the
<b>Floyd</b> | spider, and with a sharp explosion, it pulverizes the leg. But the
<b>Floyd</b> | spider is already where it wants to be.
<b>Floyd</b> | The spider wraps its remaining legs around Raccdaha's head, obscuring
<b>Floyd</b> | it entirely. Raccdaha's trashing is slowly fading. The crushing arms
<b>Floyd</b> | have lost their aim and the few blows hitting the spider make little
<b>Floyd</b> | damage. A cloud of pulverized crystal sparkles in the pulsating light.
<b>Floyd</b> | The crimson light flares up through the spider's body, but it has no
<b>Floyd</b> | effect on the spider.
<b>Floyd</b> | The creature's head is now only a blinding light, and the swirling
<b>Floyd</b> | darkness starts to melt away from the rock. The roar of terror from the
<b>Floyd</b> | creature changes into a howling shriek that comes from everywhere.
<b>Floyd</b> | The sound cuts through Lornedei's mind and soul. Then the horrible
<b>Floyd</b> | scream is not just one.
<b>Floyd</b> | There are now hundreds, thousands of howling screams of terror and pain
<b>Floyd</b> | filling the chamber.
<b>Floyd</b> | The light from the crystal spider travels to the tips of the stone
<b>Floyd</b> | fingers on both hands and down the legs. As the light covers one stone
<b>Floyd</b> | foot and reaches to cover the final glimpse of gray mossy rock on the
<b>Floyd</b> | other foot, the screaming climbs in volume further. Then it stops,
<b>Floyd</b> | leaving only a ringing in Lornedei's ears.
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, the darkness that held the stone limbs together is gone. The
<b>Floyd</b> | spider is gone, the light is fading and for a moment, Raccdaha stays
<b>Floyd</b> | upright. Then it falls into a pile of stone and steel.
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei hears the crash, but it is as if she hears it through water.
<b>Floyd</b> | The ringing is still loud in her head.
<b>Floyd</b> | She steps forward, and now the pile is actually nothing but stone and
<b>Floyd</b> | rusted steel covered with a layer of crystal dust.
<b>Floyd</b> | A glimmer catches her eye and she notices something golden lying among

<b>Floyd</b> | hole with soil and steps back.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At first, nothing happens. Then a soft golden light emerges from the
<b>Floyd</b> | soil covering the acorn. A shudder goes through the ground and the soil
<b>Floyd</b> | starts to bulge.
<b>Floyd</b> | The fog around Lornedei sings to her. It whispers long forgotten words
<b>Floyd</b> | to the earth below. A thin green leaf breaks The surface of the small
<b>Floyd</b> | pile of soil in front of Lornedei. It is quickly followed by another.
<b>Floyd</b> | They shoot out of the ground, eager to grow.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A tree starts to grow before her eyes. A seedling turns into a sapling,
<b>Floyd</b> | the sapling turns into a young tree. With limbs trembling and leaves
<b>Floyd</b> | turning towards the sky it grows into a giant oak.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The tree is growing leaves that shimmer in gold and silver, deep green
<b>Floyd</b> | and bright yellow. It keeps growing and the oak widens and stretches
<b>Floyd</b> | towards the sky to the sound of the singing mist.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The branches reach out and turn silvery.  The leaves are gold. The tree
<b>Floyd</b> | just keeps growing and roots stretch out below the soil under
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei's feet. Lornedei takes a couple of steps back and watches the
<b>Floyd</b> | still changing tree in awe. The mist begins to disappear around the
<b>Floyd</b> | girl and the oak and it is done.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The giant oak has finished growing and the leaves are humming in a soft
<b>Floyd</b> | wind coming from the west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei finds herself in the outskirts of a small village. She is
<b>Floyd</b> | standing next to the big golden oak. People gather around the tree and
<b>Floyd</b> | they all stare at it. The group consists of ten or so old women and
<b>Floyd</b> | even fewer old men in robes in sky blue, green and white. They have all
<b>Floyd</b> | gathered around the golden oak. A few of them cry, one laughs, one man
<b>Floyd</b> | grabs the arm of the man next to him for support. Smiling faces,
<b>Floyd</b> | trembling gestures towards this leaf or that. Excited whispers quickly
<b>Floyd</b> | fade as one of the old women comes forward.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She walks very slowly, supporting herself on a long staff. Despite her
<b>Floyd</b> | fragile appearance, Lornedei can feel the power within her.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Her voice is old. Her face is ancient. The words she speaks are spoken
<b>Floyd</b> | slowly.
<b>Floyd</b> | "We knew you were coming child but it took so long, so very long." she
<b>Floyd</b> | smiles and holds out her hands to Lornedei that takes them in her own.
<b>Floyd</b> | "I should have known you were a powerful one child.
<b>Floyd</b> | Now she turns towards the people. She pushes Lornedei ahead and raises
<b>Floyd</b> | a hand to get their full attention, a totally unnecessary gesture as
<b>Floyd</b> | they are all staring at the girl
<b>Floyd</b> | "Raccdaha is gone. He has been cast out of this world. He is beyond the
<b>Floyd</b> | eternal void. I cannot sense him any longer. The giant old ones are
<b>Floyd</b> | three again and the balance of the three will heal the land. Now we
<b>Floyd</b> | must step back into the world to receive the new light bearers that
<b>Floyd</b> | will come. We have waited long for the passage to open. We fled from
<b>Floyd</b> | the world outside, but now the time has come."
<b>Floyd</b> | "We are old now and we are still many years older than we seem. We are
<b>Floyd</b> | tired and not as strong as we used to be. The mist that trapped us here
<b>Floyd</b> | has also kept us alive for centuries. Now the mist is gone. Do you
<b>Floyd</b> | understand what this means girl?"
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei nods but she looks uncertain.
<b>Floyd</b> | The old light bearer removes a chain from her neck and holds it out to
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei. On the chain hangs a crystal spider. The old woman hangs it
<b>Floyd</b> | around Lornedei's neck without a word.
<b>Floyd</b> | Lornedei can hear a low murmuring of approval from the small group of
<b>Floyd</b> | people gathered and when the former Queen of the light bearers holds
<b>Floyd</b> | her arm out Lornedei gently takes it under her own and smiles.
<b>Floyd</b> | The new queen of this so far very small kingdom straightens her back
<b>Floyd</b> | and turns to the people.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |     *** The end is light, light is life. You have succeeded!***
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your final holiness is 95 out of a possible holiness of 105, in 418
