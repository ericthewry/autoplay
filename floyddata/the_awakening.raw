The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>The Awakening</i>, written by Dennis&nbsp;Matheson.  <i>The Awakening</i> was originally released in 1998. You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/460"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.</br>

So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the

<b>Floyd</b> | everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an
<b>Floyd</b> | ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The
<b>Floyd</b> | only exit is through the gate to the east.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The Awakening" is a text adventure game. You interact with the game
<b>Floyd</b> | by typing phrases like EXAMINE CHAIR or OPEN DOOR and the game
<b>Floyd</b> | responds by describing the world around you and the results of your
<b>Floyd</b> | actions.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | There are certain commands which are common to all adventure games.
<b>Floyd</b> | You move around by giving the compass direction in which you want to
<b>Floyd</b> | go; for example NORTH or SOUTHEAST. All directions can be shortened to
<b>Floyd</b> | one or two letters; in this case N or SE. You can also go UP or DOWN
<b>Floyd</b> | (U or D). In some locations IN or OUT work. You can also ENTER or
<b>Floyd</b> | CLIMB things.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When you first enter a location, the game will describe the location
<b>Floyd</b> | to you. After that, it will only tell you the name of the location.
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see the full description at any time by typing LOOK (or L).
<b>Floyd</b> | You can tell the game to always give the full description by entering
<b>Floyd</b> | VERBOSE.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You interact with the environment in many ways. You GET items to pick
<b>Floyd</b> | them up and DROP items to put them down. You can also PUT items IN
<b>Floyd</b> | things or GET items FROM others. Fairly complex sentences are
<b>Floyd</b> | possible, for example GET THE RED BRICK AND THE BLUE BALL FROM THE
<b>Floyd</b> | METAL BOX THEN THROW THE BRICK AT THE WINDOW is a valid input.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You may encounter people or other creatures while exploring the world
<b>Floyd</b> | of the game. You can ask these people questions by typing ASK person
<b>Floyd</b> | ABOUT topic and tell them things by saying TELL person ABOUT topic.
<b>Floyd</b> | You can also SHOW them things. You can ask them to do things with
<b>Floyd</b> | PERSON, COMMAND. For example, to ask Bob to pick up the book, type

<b>Floyd</b> | BOB, GET THE BOOK.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To look at an item more closely, EXAMINE it. (EXAMINE can be
<b>Floyd</b> | abbreviated as X) To get a list of everything you are carrying type
<b>Floyd</b> | INVENTORY (or I). Some other useful commands you can try are PUSH,
<b>Floyd</b> | SEARCH, SHAKE, THROW, RUB, KICK, CLIMB or READ. A part of any text

<b>Floyd</b> | adventure is learning what words the game knows. "The Awakening" knows
<b>Floyd</b> | hundreds of words, so feel free to try anything.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you get really stuck, you can access a hint menu at any time by
<b>Floyd</b> | typing HINTS. If you would rather not be tempted, you can turn the
<b>Floyd</b> | hint feature off by entering HINTS OFF.

<b>Floyd</b> | "The Awakening" is my first piece of interactive fiction. It is based
<b>Floyd</b> | (very) loosely on several stories by H.P. Lovecraft, most notably "The
<b>Floyd</b> | Outsider", "The Terrible Old Man" and "The Two Black Bottles".
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I mainly wrote "The Awakening" as a learning exercise. I had started
<b>Floyd</b> | several other games, but they were all too big and I found myself

<b>Floyd</b> | becoming overwhelmed by the scope of the game along with learning the
<b>Floyd</b> | language. I was inspired to try a smaller game by the Textfire games
<b>Floyd</b> | which came out in April of 1998. "The Awakening" became much larger
<b>Floyd</b> | than any Textfire, but the inspiration was there.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It took longer to finish the game than I expected. My main problem

<b>Floyd</b> | involved the rope that is encountered in the game. Originally, it was
<b>Floyd</b> | far more complex than what is now implemented. Even what is there now
<b>Floyd</b> | doesn't work quite as well as I would have liked.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I hope you enjoy the game. Since it is my first game, feedback is
<b>Floyd</b> | especially welcome. At this time (July 1998) my most stable e-mail

<b>Floyd</b> | address is:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Dennis_Matheson@compuserve.com
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | or, you can reach me by snail mail at:

<b>Floyd</b> | Graveyard
<b>Floyd</b> | Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the
<b>Floyd</b> | rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an

<b>Floyd</b> | unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor
<b>Floyd</b> | of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over
<b>Floyd</b> | everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an
<b>Floyd</b> | ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The
<b>Floyd</b> | only exit is through the gate to the east.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the
<b>Floyd</b> | impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the
<b>Floyd</b> | graveyard.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A large branch has been broken from one of the trees and has crushed

<b>Floyd</b> | Steeple Chamber
<b>Floyd</b> | This small chamber is about halfway up the steeple of the church. Rain
<b>Floyd</b> | and wind from the storm outside blows in through an open window frame

<b>Floyd</b> | and water collects in puddles on the warped floor, mixing with the
<b>Floyd</b> | droppings of the birds, or perhaps bats, which can be heard fluttering
<b>Floyd</b> | around overhead. Looking up, you can see a maze of beams and supports
<b>Floyd</b> | that form the interior of the steeple. Rain pours in from an opening
<b>Floyd</b> | higher in the steeple and trickles out through a trap door in the
<b>Floyd</b> | floor.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A frayed but heavy rope hangs from somewhere overhead. There is a tree
<b>Floyd</b> | branch hanging from the end of the rope.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The heavy wooden door to the north is closed.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The top of the broken section of railing is visible sticking up

<b>Floyd</b> | In the Mud

<b>Floyd</b> | Graveyard
<b>Floyd</b> | Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the
<b>Floyd</b> | rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an
<b>Floyd</b> | unmentionable sustenance from the moss-covered, moldy ground. An odor
<b>Floyd</b> | of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over

<b>Floyd</b> | everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an
<b>Floyd</b> | ivy-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The
<b>Floyd</b> | only exit is through the gate to the east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the
<b>Floyd</b> | impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the

<b>Floyd</b> | graveyard.

<b>Floyd</b> | Front of the Church
<b>Floyd</b> | Two massive oak trees which flank the cracked sidewalk dominate the
<b>Floyd</b> | front of the church. The facade of the church itself rises beyond

<b>Floyd</b> | church clean; something you somehow realize will take more than mere

<b>Floyd</b> | water to accomplish. To the north, a sidewalk leads to the front of
<b>Floyd</b> | the church. A weed-choked driveway runs to the northeast and down a
<b>Floyd</b> | hill to the south, and a muddy path leads around the church to the
<b>Floyd</b> | northwest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The church and steeple loom to the north, the open window frames

<b>Floyd</b> | This wide, graveled clearing may have once been where the worshippers
