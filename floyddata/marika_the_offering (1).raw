<b>Floyd</b> | The Room in the Tower
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | I am standing in a room that has been meticulously constructed from
<b>Floyd</b> | cold, grey stones in a very simple manner.  My eyes are hypnotically
<b>Floyd</b> | drawn to the main feature in the west wall, a large double window that
<b>Floyd</b> | swings open in the evening breeze.  A wide single bed sits in the
<b>Floyd</b> | centre of the room.  I know from experience that the bed is incredibly
<b>Floyd</b> | comfortable and it is currently taking all of my willpower to resist

<b>Floyd</b> | the temptation to lie down and drift into oblivion.  The bed is made
<b>Floyd</b> | up with a soft looking pillow and has a blanket wrapped round it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It appears to me that this room once served a less sinister purpose,
<b>Floyd</b> | for there is a fireplace built into the north wall.  The fireplace is
<b>Floyd</b> | as empty as my heart.  A thick wooden shelf is fixed to the wall

<b>Floyd</b> | above, on which rests a burning candle that gives the room an eerie
<b>Floyd</b> | glow.  The low stone ceiling separates me from the heavens and God
<b>Floyd</b> | above.  In the south wall is a thick metal door; the only way out of
<b>Floyd</b> | the tower alive.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A full-length portrait mirror is afixed to the east wall, opposite the

<b>Floyd</b> | window.  It reflects the horizon scene, creating the illusion that the
<b>Floyd</b> | room is larger than it is.  A rickety wooden chair has been placed
<b>Floyd</b> | beside the mirror.  The air is musty and offends my nostrils.  My
<b>Floyd</b> | remaining life can be measured in heartbeats.  I must act!

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My mother told me the story of the curse when I was seven.  Every
<b>Floyd</b> | child knew it off by heart, for it was the reason that the village was
<b>Floyd</b> | shunned by even the poorest beggar and cripple.  It was the reason why
<b>Floyd</b> | we were alone and downcast.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My mother wept as she told it.  I didn't know why then, but I do now.
<b>Floyd</b> | She feared that I would be The Offering, the one who must die to buy
<b>Floyd</b> | peace from The Count.  It turned out that she was right.  My mother
<b>Floyd</b> | could often see these things coming.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The Count is what we, in the old tongue, call a vampyre; the undead.
<b>Floyd</b> | He used to be a nobleman but fell into darkness in some way.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | legends are not clear, though my mother told me that she believed it
<b>Floyd</b> | was because of a woman.  As a child this was something else that I did
<b>Floyd</b> | not understand, but I am beginning to know what she might have meant.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The cause of his curse is irrelevant, as is the reason why he chose
<b>Floyd</b> | our village to be the one he torments.  All that matters is that he
<b>Floyd</b> | did choose us.  He made a bargain with the elders of our village many
<b>Floyd</b> | generations ago.  He promised that he would leave us in peace on one
<b>Floyd</b> | condition.  Every fifteen years the purest and most beautiful maiden
<b>Floyd</b> | in the village must be delivered over to him.  I was born the night of

<b>Floyd</b> | his last visit to the village.  Many considered it an omen; a
<b>Floyd</b> | prophetic gesture that I was to be his next victim.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As I grew my parents prayed that I would fall ill and become weak, or
<b>Floyd</b> | that I would be ugly.  The prayers of the villagers have remained
<b>Floyd</b> | unanswered for years and years now, and the prayers of my parents were

<b>Floyd</b> | no different.  I grew strong and, as I am often told, blossomed into
<b>Floyd</b> | beauty.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As the years passed and the dread night approached my parents begged
<b>Floyd</b> | me to flee the village.  They offered to marry me off to a farmer in
<b>Floyd</b> | the next village, but the elders opposed them.  It seemed that, to

<b>Floyd</b> | protect their own daughters, they had already decided that the timing
<b>Floyd</b> | of my birth meant I was to be the one.  My parents were powerless, for
<b>Floyd</b> | was it not true that of all the young girls in the village I was
<b>Floyd</b> | amongst the finest and prettiest?

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | It was decided by lot yesterday afternoon.  I was to be The Offering,
<b>Floyd</b> | the one that The Count was to feast upon to ensure the safety of my
<b>Floyd</b> | people for the next fifteen years.  I was dressed in a simple linen
<b>Floyd</b> | frock, given my last meal of boar and stewed vegetables and cruelly
<b>Floyd</b> | deprived of sleep by the phantom of fear.  The next day, my birthday
<b>Floyd</b> | and my final day, passed in a haze of anxiety and exhaustion and

<b>Floyd</b> | solitary confinement to prevent escape or - the worst of sins -
<b>Floyd</b> | suicide.  I paced back and forth, too tired to think and yet too
<b>Floyd</b> | terrified to sleep.  When my mother entered the room and embraced me
<b>Floyd</b> | she may as well have been an angel as far as my fevoured imagination
<b>Floyd</b> | was concerned.  She spoke in hushed tones, not wishing the guards
<b>Floyd</b> | outside the room to overhear.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "My dearest Marika," she began, "I have long suspected the truth.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | Count takes one of our best and then leaves us for fifteen years.
<b>Floyd</b> | Many have speculated that our bargain is what keeps us safe for that
<b>Floyd</b> | period of time.  They are the loudest voices amongst us, the ones that
<b>Floyd</b> | say that our sacrifice saves us from extended torment; that The Count

<b>Floyd</b> | drinks the blood of travellers and the children of other villages for
<b>Floyd</b> | that time.  I think that they are wrong."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I blinked, confused and uncertain of what my mother was telling me.
<b>Floyd</b> | She continued regardless.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "I believe that The Count is a creature who only visits us once every
<b>Floyd</b> | fifteen years because for most of that time he sleeps.  I believe that
<b>Floyd</b> | he awakes every fifteen years to feed, and he threatens us and uses
<b>Floyd</b> | our children to slake his terrible thirst.  After he has satisfied his
<b>Floyd</b> | cruel desire he surrenders to sleep again.  Fifteen years pass and the
<b>Floyd</b> | cycle begins again.  He must be at his weakest following the end of

<b>Floyd</b> | his hibernation - the night that he takes one of our daughters, his
<b>Floyd</b> | first kill."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "But what does this mean mother?  Do you expect me to fight him?  To
<b>Floyd</b> | kill him?  If this is true why do the men not hunt him and kill him as
<b>Floyd</b> | he sleeps for fifteen years?"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The men of this village are slaves to the legend; to the fear.  They
<b>Floyd</b> | do not believe me.  But we Bojin women are strong!  You can fight him,
<b>Floyd</b> | my daughter.  You can keep him at bay!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "What do you mean, mother? " I whimpered , "I do not understand."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I know that in his initial weakness he could be beaten and we could
<b>Floyd</b> | be rid of him forever!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Mother, I am so tired.  I am not sure I can do this..."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "You do not need to fight him, my child.  Just keep him at bay.  They
<b>Floyd</b> | will take you to the tower.  The door will be locked so you will not
<b>Floyd</b> | be able to escape. Sleep will overtake you and then The Count will
<b>Floyd</b> | arrive.  In the time that you have before the darkness you must make
<b>Floyd</b> | the room secure!  I am sure that he will be too weak to force entry if
<b>Floyd</b> | you can just keep him out!"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I...mother.  I don't know.  I can't think...."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At this my mother grabbed my arm tightly.  It hurt, and the pain
<b>Floyd</b> | brought me to my senses.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Daughter!  Do not give up!  You can do this!"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At that moment the guards entered the room.  My mother stepped back,
<b>Floyd</b> | looking anxious.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm sorry.  It is time," Bogdan, the eldest guard, spoke
<b>Floyd</b> | apologetically.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I understand," my mother said, biting her bottom lip.  She looked at
<b>Floyd</b> | me again, willing me to understand and to fight my fate.  The world
<b>Floyd</b> | seemed to pass in slow motion as I gazed at the men who had come to

<b>Floyd</b> | escort me to the place of my death.  Bogdan was a friend of my father,
<b>Floyd</b> | and I could see in his eyes the anguish that only a man with the
<b>Floyd</b> | imagination to picture his own daughter could feel.  Enric was a few
<b>Floyd</b> | years older than me, and the regret in his eyes was the loss of what
<b>Floyd</b> | could have been.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Goodbye Marika, and may God go with you."  My mother kissed me on the
<b>Floyd</b> | cheek, gently ran her hand through my hair and fled from the room.
<b>Floyd</b> | Bogdan nodded at me and took me by the hand.  The men led me from the
<b>Floyd</b> | room and out into the twilight of the empty village.  It was
<b>Floyd</b> | considered bad luck to see the Offering on the night of her departure.
<b>Floyd</b> | It was safer to stay at home behind closed doors and pretend that

<b>Floyd</b> | nothing terrible was about to happen.  Overcome, I stumbled and fell
<b>Floyd</b> | to my knees.  I felt the gentle hands of Enric under my arms.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I do not...I do not know if I can do it," I whispered, every word an
<b>Floyd</b> | effort.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "I will carry you." Enric lifted me gently as Bogdan patted his
<b>Floyd</b> | shoulder.  I looked into Enric's face as he began to walk towards the
<b>Floyd</b> | Tower that lay just outside the village and felt the darkness of sleep
<b>Floyd</b> | cover me for the first time in about thirty six hours.  In my dreams
<b>Floyd</b> | Enric's face changed into that of my mother as she mouthed the same
<b>Floyd</b> | words at me over and over again - Keep him out!

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | I awoke with a start to find that I was lying on a comfortable bed.
<b>Floyd</b> | Enric was leaning over me, a single tear rolling down his cheek.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm sorry.  I did not mean to wake you.  I wanted...I wanted you to
<b>Floyd</b> | stay asleep.  I thought it would be...better."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "I am glad that you did," I murmered, recalling my mother's final
<b>Floyd</b> | words.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Enric kissed me on the cheek and stood up.  He wiped the eye from his
<b>Floyd</b> | face and turned away.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Marika...I must tell you something..." Enric spoke, weighing his
<b>Floyd</b> | words carefully.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Enric!" barked Bogdan, "Remember what the Elders said!  You will not
<b>Floyd</b> | say anything!"
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Enric's shoulders stiffened and, even though I couldn't see his face,
<b>Floyd</b> | I could tell that he was wrestling with something heavy.  Finally his
<b>Floyd</b> | shoulders slumped and he began to walk towards the door.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Goodbye Marika.  I'm sorry," he said with conviction.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Bogdan stood in the doorway, looking at me with grim regret.  In a
<b>Floyd</b> | moment they were both gone.  The door slammed shut and I heard the
<b>Floyd</b> | scraping of a key in the lock and the grinding of several bolts being
<b>Floyd</b> | shut.  I listened for a moment longer to the clatter of their feet on
<b>Floyd</b> | the stone stairwell and then I was alone.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The tower had been a feature of the village for generations before my
<b>Floyd</b> | birth.  It stood, tall and imposing, on the outskirts of our land as a
<b>Floyd</b> | permanent reminder of our bargain.  It remained locked and bolted for
<b>Floyd</b> | years until the single room at its summit was needed.  The only ones
<b>Floyd</b> | who ever saw the room were the guards and The Offering.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Everything in me wanted to sink back into the comfort of the bed and
<b>Floyd</b> | let death overtake me.  My body ached for sleep and my heart longed
<b>Floyd</b> | for numbness.  But just as I thought I would lose the battle I felt my
<b>Floyd</b> | mother's spirit arc through my heart.  I am a Bojin and I will NOT
<b>Floyd</b> | give up!  I willed my legs to respond and I lifted myself from the bed
<b>Floyd</b> | until I found myself standing in the room that was supposed to be my

<b>Floyd</b> | mortuary.  I glanced out of the window to see the sun slowly slipping
<b>Floyd</b> | behind the hills.  My head throbbed and my legs wavered.  I did not
<b>Floyd</b> | have much time, but I formed a grim resolve to try and change my fate.
<b>Floyd</b> | I would not accept this.  I would be alone here until the morning,
<b>Floyd</b> | when Bogdan and Enric would return expecting to remove my corpse.  I
<b>Floyd</b> | would prevent The Count from gaining entrance to the Tower, and when

<b>Floyd</b> | Bogdan and Enric returned I would leave with them.  I would show
<b>Floyd</b> | myself to be my mother's daughter.  My life depended on it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I forced myself to focus on the room and gazed around, battling
<b>Floyd</b> | against slumber.  My fate will be decided in the next half an hour.

<b>Floyd</b> | complexion has always been pale, but tonight lack of sleep and
<b>Floyd</b> | overdose of fear have made my skin almost translucent.  The blood has

<b>Floyd</b> | drained from my usually scarlet lips and my large brown eyes peer into
<b>Floyd</b> | the face of a stranger.  My long hair, raven and fine, hugs my face
<b>Floyd</b> | and shoulders almost as if it were looking for a companion in this
<b>Floyd</b> | dark time.  A sensation at the back of my thoughts is nagging me,
<b>Floyd</b> | trying to tell me something.  Something about my hair...
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | I run my fingers around the mirror but it seems to be fixed firmly to

<b>Floyd</b> | The Room in the Tower
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | I am standing in a room that has been meticulously constructed from
<b>Floyd</b> | cold, grey stones in a very simple manner.  The large window in the
<b>Floyd</b> | west wall has been shut and I have managed to lock it.  If my mother
<b>Floyd</b> | is right then the thick glass should be sufficient to keep The Count
<b>Floyd</b> | at bay.  A wide single bed sits in the centre of the room.  I know
<b>Floyd</b> | from experience that the bed is incredibly comfortable and it is

<b>Floyd</b> | currently taking all of my willpower to resist the temptation to lie
<b>Floyd</b> | down and drift into oblivion.  The bed is currently without a blanket,
<b>Floyd</b> | but that makes it no less inviting.  A flat and sturdy looking length
<b>Floyd</b> | of iron rod lies on the floor beside the bed.  A small piece of paper
<b>Floyd</b> | is situated on the stone floor.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | It appears to me that this room once served a less sinister purpose,
<b>Floyd</b> | for there is a fireplace built into the north wall.  A pile of broken
<b>Floyd</b> | and twisted wood lies in the fireplace, imploring me to light it.  A
<b>Floyd</b> | thick wooden shelf is fixed to the wall above, on which rests a
<b>Floyd</b> | burning candle that gives the room an eerie glow.  Having been used to
<b>Floyd</b> | lock the window, the hairpin on the shelf is bent and twisted beyond

<b>Floyd</b> | recognition.  The low stone ceiling separates me from the heavens and
<b>Floyd</b> | God above.  In the south wall is a thick metal door; the only way out
<b>Floyd</b> | of the tower alive.  The bulky woollen blanket from the bed is crammed
<b>Floyd</b> | under the door.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A full-length portrait mirror is afixed to the east wall, opposite the

<b>Floyd</b> | window.  It reflects the horizon scene, creating the illusion that the
<b>Floyd</b> | room is larger than it is.  The air is musty and offends my nostrils.
<b>Floyd</b> | My remaining life can be measured in heartbeats.  I must act!

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I have to rely purely on my sense of touch to discern if there is
<b>Floyd</b> | anything of interest in the hole.  For a few seconds all I am able to
<b>Floyd</b> | feel is the cold, wet density of damp stone and a soft breeze, but

<b>Floyd</b> | after a moment of maneouvering I brush against something rough and
<b>Floyd</b> | soft.  Nervously I grab the object and begin to pull it towards me.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As I do so I hear a tinkling noise.  I pause as the sound moves away
<b>Floyd</b> | from me, but it is too late.  I listen as something metallic slithers
<b>Floyd</b> | away, sounding like it's falling through a fissure below me.  There is

<b>Floyd</b> | a further moment of silence before something clatters to the ground on
<b>Floyd</b> | the level below me.  My imagination ponders the events that these

<b>Floyd</b> | this second of contemplation I continue my action and pull the object

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | I climb onto my knees with my prize, which appears to be a grubby old

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My Dearest Marika,
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Forgive me for the complicated path that you must have walked to
<b>Floyd</b> | obtain this letter.  I had no other choice and knew that your

<b>Floyd</b> | resourcefulness would be equal to the task.  The elders of the village
<b>Floyd</b> | know well your mother's views on the subject of The Count and feared
<b>Floyd</b> | that she might attempt to intervene in events.  As a result they
<b>Floyd</b> | declared it a capital offence for anyone to try and aid you in your
<b>Floyd</b> | plight.  I desired greatly to help you but was afraid that Bogdan
<b>Floyd</b> | would hold me to account and that I would be forced to pay the

<b>Floyd</b> | ultimate price for aiding you.  Bogdan is a good man, but he fears the
<b>Floyd</b> | elders and he fears The Count even more.  I left a message for you on
<b>Floyd</b> | the mirror and a clue under your pillow.  I had to phrase the clue as
<b>Floyd</b> | though it were a simple farewell message that wouldn't incriminate me
<b>Floyd</b> | - just in case it were seen by someone other than you.  Again, forgive
<b>Floyd</b> | me but I knew that you would be able to solve the puzzle.  You are a

<b>Floyd</b> | remarkable girl.  I will try and speak with you before I must leave
<b>Floyd</b> | and hope that Bogdan allows it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I pray that your mother is right; that The Count can be beaten but I
<b>Floyd</b> | do not know how.  I have heard many amazing things about him.  I have
<b>Floyd</b> | heard that he has the ability to turn into a bat as well as the

<b>Floyd</b> | capability to scale vertical surfaces.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I am sorry that I did not have the chance to say farewell properly.
<b>Floyd</b> | To this end I wrote this letter and wrapped it in a rag with my silver
<b>Floyd</b> | crucifix.  As you know, I hid the package under the loose flagstone
<b>Floyd</b> | and I hope that the crucifix will be of some comfort, if nothing else.

<b>Floyd</b> | I will be praying for you.  Do not let my fear dampen your remarkable
<b>Floyd</b> | spirit.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Enric.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My head swims with the information.  Enric!  Of course!  Only a guard

<b>Floyd</b> | would have the freedom to leave items for me in the tower.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | message on the mirror was his doing, leading me to find the metal rod
<b>Floyd</b> | so that I could discover this letter under the flagstone.  But Enric
<b>Floyd</b> | didn't only intend for me to find a letter.  He made reference to his
<b>Floyd</b> | silver crucifix.  It would be a helpful weapon in a fight against a
<b>Floyd</b> | vampyre, but it was not present with the parchment.  I recall my

<b>Floyd</b> | actions as I discovered the letter and my imagination replays the
<b>Floyd</b> | sounds that I heard as I pulled the rag free from its prison.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | metallic tinkling sound.  The sound of something slithering away from
<b>Floyd</b> | me.  My heart sinks as I piece everything together.  Enric's silver
<b>Floyd</b> | crucifix must have fallen free of the rag as I moved it and dropped
<b>Floyd</b> | down a fissure in the stones to the stairwell below this room.  It

<b>Floyd</b> | will do me little good down there.  My one chance to turn the tables
<b>Floyd</b> | and I have lost it before I even knew what it was that I was losing!
<b>Floyd</b> | I scream in frustration and throw the letter to the ground.  What hope
<b>Floyd</b> | do I have now?

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My dreams are vivid and terrifying.  I picture myself slipping into a
<b>Floyd</b> | void, surrounded by infinite darkness.  A hundred horrific images spin
<b>Floyd</b> | at me from the emptiness surrounding me.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I see thin, cruel hands clawing at a window.  The hands become more
<b>Floyd</b> | and more frantic until they become balled fists slamming themselves
<b>Floyd</b> | against the glass in futility...then the image vanishes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I hear a rustling sound, a squeaking noise and something that sounds

<b>Floyd</b> | like a thousand terrible wings flapping mere metres away from me.  I
<b>Floyd</b> | smell damp fur and then...I smell smoke and see a flash.  I hear a
<b>Floyd</b> | pained squeal which mutates into a hideous cry...then the image
<b>Floyd</b> | vanishes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I feel something moving under the stones.  Something pushing against

<b>Floyd</b> | the floor in desperation.  I see the darkness pressing against the
<b>Floyd</b> | loose flagstone in the floor, but it is repelled.  I hear the flapping
<b>Floyd</b> | of wings...then the image vanishes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The door rattles.  It shakes on its hinges but does not move.  In my
<b>Floyd</b> | dream the rag and blanket shake and writhe like they're alive but

<b>Floyd</b> | remain in place.  The door shakes with increased vigour and a rhythmic
<b>Floyd</b> | pounding that chokes the breath in my throat.  There is a haunting
<b>Floyd</b> | scream...then the image vanishes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For what seems like many hours the visions of my dream repeat.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | door and windows rattle over and over.  I hear the sound of some

<b>Floyd</b> | winged creature exploring every nook of the room around me.  I can
<b>Floyd</b> | feel the presence of some horrific evil merely a few feet away from
<b>Floyd</b> | me.  I watch myself toss and turn, shaking, in my sleep but such is my
<b>Floyd</b> | exhaustion that I do not wake.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then, from nowhere, a burst of light seems to creep into the room and

<b>Floyd</b> | my mind is nearly driven insane by a sinister, prolonged, tortured
<b>Floyd</b> | wail from somewhere.  Just as my heart feels like it is about to burst
<b>Floyd</b> | there is silence.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then all is still and peace descends upon me...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My eyes open and drink in the sunlight but my ears are deafened by the
<b>Floyd</b> | sound of hammering fists and yelling voices outside the door.  I lie
<b>Floyd</b> | paralysed by fear, expecting The Count to burst through the doorway at

<b>Floyd</b> | any second...but then I listen to the words.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Marika!  Marika!  Are you all right?" screams a voice that I
<b>Floyd</b> | recognise.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I sit up and watch the door for a second.  Someone has tried to remove

<b>Floyd</b> | the rag and the blanket and failed.  My sluggish brain slowly pieces
<b>Floyd</b> | together the facts.  I am alive, it is morning and someone is trying
<b>Floyd</b> | to get into the room but unable because I have secured it.  As this
<b>Floyd</b> | last piece of information sinks in I jump off the bed with a gasp and
<b>Floyd</b> | rush over to the door.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | With a sense of elation I pull the rag from the keyhole and bang on
<b>Floyd</b> | the door.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It's me!  Marika!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Marika!" a voice I recognise almost screams, and then I hear the

<b>Floyd</b> | scraping of a key being fumbled in the lock.  The door swings open.
<b>Floyd</b> | Enric stands there, tears streaming down his cheeks, with Bogdan
<b>Floyd</b> | behind him looking astonished.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Unable to contain my delight I throw myself into Enric's shocked arms
<b>Floyd</b> | and he holds me tightly, neither of us speaking.  The silence is

<b>Floyd</b> | broken by Bogdan grabbing my shoulder roughly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "What have you done girl!  You've doomed us all!" he yells, his face
<b>Floyd</b> | contorted with rage.  Enric breaks the embrace to shove Bogdan away.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "She has shown more courage than anyone else in this village!" Enric

<b>Floyd</b> | shouts, fists clenched tightly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "We'll need more than courage to disuade The Count from his terrible
<b>Floyd</b> | revenge!" Bogdan shrieks back.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Ignoring the confrontation I rush past them both and down the stairs,

<b>Floyd</b> | thrilling at the feel of wood under my feet.

<b>Floyd</b> | I push the door open and burst out into the daylight with Bogdan and
<b>Floyd</b> | Enric hot on my heels.  I stumble around the base of the tower as
<b>Floyd</b> | though intoxicated, searching desperately for something to confirm the

<b>Floyd</b> | suspicions of my dream.  I find it on the opposite side of the tower,
<b>Floyd</b> | on the grassy ground below the room's window.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Enric and Bogdan catch up shortly afterwards and stutter to a halt
<b>Floyd</b> | behind me, staring at same sight as me.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "What...what is that?" Bogdan whispers.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We are looking at a corpse, a twisted mess of bones and thick fluid.
<b>Floyd</b> | Decaying flesh hangs from the skeleton and two sharp teeth protrude
<b>Floyd</b> | obscenely from the skull.  In my head I imagine a warped creature of
<b>Floyd</b> | the night striving to enter the room, struggling and failing but so

<b>Floyd</b> | absorbed in the task that he fails to see the sun rising over the
<b>Floyd</b> | horizon until it is too late...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I think," I begin, a huge smile creeping across my face, "that it is
<b>Floyd</b> | over..."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | I feel Enric's gentle hand on my shoulder and hear Bogdan begin to
<b>Floyd</b> | weep behind me.  I look up into the sky.  It seems to me the bluest

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I plan to enjoy every second of it.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Room in the Tower
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I am standing in a room that has been meticulously constructed from

<b>Floyd</b> | cold, grey stones in a very simple manner.  My eyes are hypnotically
<b>Floyd</b> | drawn to the main feature in the west wall, a large double window that
<b>Floyd</b> | swings open in the evening breeze.  A wide single bed sits in the
<b>Floyd</b> | centre of the room.  I know from experience that the bed is incredibly
<b>Floyd</b> | comfortable and it is currently taking all of my willpower to resist
<b>Floyd</b> | the temptation to lie down and drift into oblivion.  The bed is made

<b>Floyd</b> | up with a soft looking pillow and has a blanket wrapped round it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It appears to me that this room once served a less sinister purpose,
<b>Floyd</b> | for there is a fireplace built into the north wall.  The fireplace is
<b>Floyd</b> | as empty as my heart.  A thick wooden shelf is fixed to the wall
<b>Floyd</b> | above, on which rests a burning candle that gives the room an eerie

<b>Floyd</b> | glow.  The low stone ceiling separates me from the heavens and God
<b>Floyd</b> | above.  In the south wall is a thick metal door; the only way out of
<b>Floyd</b> | the tower alive.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A full-length portrait mirror is afixed to the east wall, opposite the
<b>Floyd</b> | window.  It reflects the horizon scene, creating the illusion that the

<b>Floyd</b> | room is larger than it is.  A rickety wooden chair has been placed
<b>Floyd</b> | beside the mirror.  The air is musty and offends my nostrils.  My
<b>Floyd</b> | remaining life can be measured in heartbeats.  I must act!

<b>Floyd</b> | I offer my sincerest thanks to the elite cadre of beta-testers who

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks to fellow Drifters - alsnpk, djchallis, Lumin and The Mighty
<b>Floyd</b> | Ren for their beta-testing efforts.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Special thanks to alsnpk and The Mighty Ren for very helpful
<b>Floyd</b> | suggestions concerning the hint system and the plot (respectively).

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks also to those who played and reviewed A Fine Day for Reaping
<b>Floyd</b> | during this year's IF Comp.  Those who offered kind comments about my
<b>Floyd</b> | writing encouraged me, and those who pointed out the multitude of
<b>Floyd</b> | errors in implementation challenged me to try something a little less

<b>Floyd</b> | I decide to try and move the loose flagstone and it occurs to me that
<b>Floyd</b> | the iron rod might be perfectly suited to this task.  I grip it
<b>Floyd</b> | tightly and slowly work the flat end into the thin gap between the

<b>Floyd</b> | flagstones.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When I believe that I have inserted the rod as far as I can I take a
<b>Floyd</b> | deep breath and begin to apply pressure.  Lifting the stone is much
<b>Floyd</b> | easier than I thought it would be and within a few seconds I have
<b>Floyd</b> | managed to tip it enough to prise it out of the floor.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I cast the rod aside and begin to wonder what, if anything, might be
<b>Floyd</b> | contained within the dark cavity that I have uncovered...
