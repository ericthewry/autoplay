The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Intro to Jabberwocky</i>, written by Gregory Weir.  <I>Intro to Jabberwocky</I> was originally released as part of the 2004 IntroComp, where it took first place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Intro_to_Jabberwocky'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | Shore of the Wabe
<b>Floyd</b> | From far off to the west you can hear the toves calling, a sad, lonely
<b>Floyd</b> | sound, punctuated only by their happy cries of greeting when they
<b>Floyd</b> | encounter one another. The pink mist of the wabe quietly drifts by,
<b>Floyd</b> | occasionally lapping up on shore in billows of sweet-smelling fog.
<b>Floyd</b> | Above, the suns gently glow. Along the shore to the north is a
<b>Floyd</b> | chicken-wire enclosure, and to the south is a small wooden structure.
<b>Floyd</b> | The sand gives way to grass along the path back to your house in the
<b>Floyd</b> | east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A worn tablet lies here, half-buried in the sand.

<b>Floyd</b> | large as a beach ball, and six long, thin, insectile legs protrude
<b>Floyd</b> | from the equator of their body. They have two small, stubby, antennae,
<b>Floyd</b> | and a dish-shaped organ at the top of their head that allows them to
<b>Floyd</b> | "see" the world around them using a type of echolocation called
<b>Floyd</b> | mimsing. However, at the moment they are in a panic, not at all mimsy.
<b>Floyd</b> | They blindly bump against the wire fence around the pen. The cause of
<b>Floyd</b> | their disturbance is obvious: one of them seems to be badly hurt, and
<b>Floyd</b> | lies motionless in the center of the pen. Beware, though; they can
<b>Floyd</b> | still smell you, and in their confusion, they seem to classify you as

<b>Floyd</b> | Tove Corral
<b>Floyd</b> | It took you and your father an entire week to build this enclosure,
<b>Floyd</b> | but it was worth the effort: not one of your family's toves has ever
<b>Floyd</b> | been attacked in the night. The corral has four sturdy walls and a
<b>Floyd</b> | slate roof, but the bottom is open. This allows the rose-colored mist
<b>Floyd</b> | from the wabe in, which in turn keeps your toves alive. During the
<b>Floyd</b> | night, they're kept in by the half-submerged door, which is held
<b>Floyd</b> | closed by a nice secure latch. You stand on a catwalk affixed to one
<b>Floyd</b> | wall, and little tendrils of fog waft up between the catwalk's metal
<b>Floyd</b> | bars.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your family's toves drift around aimlessly. For some reason, they're

<b>Floyd</b> | Shore of the Wabe
<b>Floyd</b> | From far off to the west you can hear the toves calling, a sad, lonely
<b>Floyd</b> | sound, punctuated only by their happy cries of greeting when they
<b>Floyd</b> | encounter one another. The pink mist of the wabe quietly drifts by,
<b>Floyd</b> | occasionally lapping up on shore in billows of sweet-smelling fog.
<b>Floyd</b> | Above, the suns gently glow. Along the shore to the north is a
<b>Floyd</b> | chicken-wire enclosure, and to the south is a small wooden structure.
<b>Floyd</b> | The sand gives way to grass along the path back to your house in the
<b>Floyd</b> | east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In Front of House
<b>Floyd</b> | You feel happy here in front of your house. The coat of white paint on
<b>Floyd</b> | the house was recently retouched, and your father has planted flowers
<b>Floyd</b> | in the window boxes. You can hear the mournful calling of the toves in
<b>Floyd</b> | the wabe to the west, and there are bare paths worn into the dirt
<b>Floyd</b> | around the corners of the house to the northeast and southeast.

<b>Floyd</b> | This game was written in Inform by Gregory Weir. It is my first game,
<b>Floyd</b> | and this intro was released for the 2004 IntroComp.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks to my great beta-testers: Don Weir, Xenia Kramida, Niall
<b>Floyd</b> | Richard Murphy, Robert DeFord, Greg Boettcher, Jessica Knoch, Cedric
<b>Floyd</b> | Knight, Graham Holden, Ross Presser, and Tommy Herbert.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The game is based on the poem "Jabberwocky", by Lewis Carroll, aka
<b>Floyd</b> | Rev. Charles Dodgson. The poem was originally released on its own, and
<b>Floyd</b> | was then incorporated into Through the Looking Glass. In that book,
<b>Floyd</b> | Humpty-Dumpty gave his own interpretation of the poem in that novel,
<b>Floyd</b> | but who's about to listen to an unstable old egg?

<b>Floyd</b> | Lewis Carroll's real name was Rev. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. His life
<b>Floyd</b> | is a bit of a mystery to modern-day biographers because of his
<b>Floyd</b> | Victorian attitude of hiding his innermost thoughts. His diaries are
<b>Floyd</b> | complete and well-written, but they mostly tell of events, not of
<b>Floyd</b> | feelings. In addition, a large portion of the diaries are missing,
<b>Floyd</b> | either lost or hidden by his modern-day relatives.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is important to state that Dodgson did not use hallucinogenic drugs
<b>Floyd</b> | at any time during his life. The mere idea would have repelled him.
<b>Floyd</b> | Nor was he a pedophile, in the traditional sense of the word. Despite
<b>Floyd</b> | what he vaguely termed "unholy thoughts" at night, which he suppressed
<b>Floyd</b> | by working out methematical problems in his head, he would have found
<b>Floyd</b> | the idea of corrupting the innocence of his "child-friends" repugnant.
<b>Floyd</b> | Indeed, it is likely that he was drawn to little girls because of
<b>Floyd</b> | their apparent purity. A Victorian in every way, it appears that
<b>Floyd</b> | thinking of sexual matters made him quite uncomfortable. Although the
<b>Floyd</b> | matter is open to debate, it was said that he died a virgin.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | However, any biography, however short, of Dodgson must not avoid
<b>Floyd</b> | mentioning his hobby of photography. Besides his photography of famous
<b>Floyd</b> | literary personas and others, he also enjoyed taking pictures of his
<b>Floyd</b> | "child-friends" "sans habiliment", as he liked to say. However, the
<b>Floyd</b> | girls' mothers were almost invariably present, and Dodgson himself
<b>Floyd</b> | once said that there was no greater sin than to try to force a girl
<b>Floyd</b> | into posing nude. Indeed, later accounts by Dodgson's models state
<b>Floyd</b> | that the only discomfort the girls felt was boredom, because it was
<b>Floyd</b> | much more interesting when Dodgson dressed them up in costume!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is likely that we will never truly understand Dodgson, but perhaps
<b>Floyd</b> | this game can be a bit of an insight into one way his mind may have
<b>Floyd</b> | worked.
