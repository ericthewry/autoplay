The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Afflicted</i>, written by Doug Egan.  <I>Afflicted</I> was originally released as part of the 2008 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took fourth place. It went on to be nominated for three Xyzzy Awards: Best Story, Best Individual Puzzle, and Best Use of Medium.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Afflicted'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | Afflicted
<b>Floyd</b> | A short work of interactive horror
<b>Floyd</b> | Copyright 2008, Doug Egan
<b>Floyd</b> | Annual Competition Version
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game is intended to be enjoyed by both newcomers to IF and
<b>Floyd</b> | veteran players.  If you have never played interactive fiction, you
<b>Floyd</b> | are encouraged to return to the main menu and review the information
<b>Floyd</b> | under "General Instructions".
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Afflicted implements only a select number of new verbs.  The most
<b>Floyd</b> | important of these is the action "note".  Other changes should be
<b>Floyd</b> | obvious within the context of the game. "Ask" and "Tell" are synonyms
<b>Floyd</b> | in this game. Likewise "Give" and "Show". On the other hand, "Read"
<b>Floyd</b> | and "Examine" may give different responses for readable material.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The "Smell" action is fully implemented.  Each location has a unique
<b>Floyd</b> | odor.  A small number of individual objects also have their own odor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | type "Hint" to access the adaptive hint menu.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is possible to end a game prematurely, sometimes in ways which can
<b>Floyd</b> | not be reversed by a single "undo" command.  Players are encouraged to
<b>Floyd</b> | save often and search for multiple alternate endings.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You could escape through the drain pipe in the ceiling.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Methods for warding or killing a vampire are so widely known, they are

<b>Floyd</b> | wooden cross worn around the neck should effectively ward off both the
<b>Floyd</b> | Bratislavan and Transylvanian type vampires.  For killing, only a
<b>Floyd</b> | weapon made of silver has any permanent effect.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Of course one is not likely to find these implements (garlic, crosses,
<b>Floyd</b> | or silver weapons) in the vampire's own abode.  This creates a problem
<b>Floyd</b> | for Bratislavan vampires who desire nothing so much as to kill and
<b>Floyd</b> | dominate their rivals.  They achieve this without the use of silver
<b>Floyd</b> | (which might be turned against them) by dismembering their opponents
<b>Floyd</b> | and scattering the remaining parts as widely as possible.  Yet even
<b>Floyd</b> | this gruesome ritual is impermanent.  The dismembered parts of a
<b>Floyd</b> | vampire retain their own force of will, and strive to reassemble
<b>Floyd</b> | themselves by whatever means available.

<b>Floyd</b> | Dining Room
<b>Floyd</b> | The restaurant area of Nikolai's is relatively small:  no more than a
<b>Floyd</b> | dozen four top tables, many still littered with yesterday's crumbs.  A
<b>Floyd</b> | larger bar area--the primary source of revenue here--lies to the east.
<b>Floyd</b> | A rickety staircase leads to small balcony outside Nikolai's office
<b>Floyd</b> | loft.  A wide mirror is mounted on the wall high above, right near his
<b>Floyd</b> | office entrance.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the south end of the room, a long window provides an unattractive
<b>Floyd</b> | view of the street.  The galley kitchen is north of here.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | Though it feels awkward to strike with your left hand, the letter
<b>Floyd</b> | opener slides into Sofia's chest as easily as a hot knife through
<b>Floyd</b> | butter.  Sofia's mouth drops.  Her expression speaks a sense of
<b>Floyd</b> | betrayal.  Then her body is overcome with epileptic seizures.  You are
<b>Floyd</b> | deafened by a momentary blast of thunder.  Sofia has disintegrated.
<b>Floyd</b> | Nothing remains but fly-size specks of blood and tissue painted
<b>Floyd</b> | against walls and ceiling. You race to your car to vacate the
<b>Floyd</b> | neighborhood before police arrive.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You read in the newspaper the next day that police are unable to
<b>Floyd</b> | explain the carnage and gore they discovered at Nikolai's Bar and
<b>Floyd</b> | Grill that morning.  Police are still looking for the culprit.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As for you, you are happy to have destroyed a coven of vampires.  It
<b>Floyd</b> | is a shame that you became afflicted by the means of Sofia's kiss.
<b>Floyd</b> | Now every night you find yourself trolling the streets for your own
<b>Floyd</b> | stable of victims.
