The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Mother Loose</i> by Irene Callaci.  <i>Mother Loose</i> was originally released as part of the 1998 IF Competition, where it took sixth place.  It was also a finalist for Best NPCs and Best Individual PC at the 1998 Xyzzy Awards.

You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting the <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Mother_Loose"><u>IFWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played it, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | Hilltop

<b>Floyd</b> | Grass sweeps up the hill like a brushfire, growing taller and thicker
<b>Floyd</b> | as it approaches the top where you brace yourself against the wind. You
<b>Floyd</b> | can see everything from up here: the forest, the village, even the
<b>Floyd</b> | fence where you first met the egg. The schoolhouse and its clock tower
<b>Floyd</b> | lie to the northwest.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | A crumbling brick well sits at the very top of the hill, almost hidden
<b>Floyd</b> | in a nest of grass. It's the simplest of designs--no cute roof, no
<b>Floyd</b> | crank, no rope or bucket--just a simple, brick cylinder in the ground.
<b>Floyd</b> | The cover, if it ever had one, is gone. From deep within the well's
<b>Floyd</b> | depths, you hear faint scratching noises interspersed with pathetic
<b>Floyd</b> | mewing.

<b>Floyd</b> | Meadow Behind the Bungalow
<b>Floyd</b> | Grass surrounds you, acres of it, spreading across the countryside as

<b>Floyd</b> | far as you can see. A ribbon of flattened grass curves eastward, and
<b>Floyd</b> | another, not quite as fresh, circles the bungalow, branching northeast
<b>Floyd</b> | and northwest. A grass-covered hill to the southwest shimmers under the
<b>Floyd</b> | sun's heat; waves of green-gold grass ripple toward the crest of the

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Mary is here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A cuddly lamb prances about, seemingly unaware of your presence.

<b>Floyd</b> | The abandoned schoolroom lacks not only pupils, but also books and
<b>Floyd</b> | pencils and chalk and paper and any other hint that someone might show
<b>Floyd</b> | up for school tomorrow. Or the next day. Or the next. Rows of empty
<b>Floyd</b> | desks and chairs face the teacher's desk at the front of the room as if

<b>Floyd</b> | never tell, so what's the use in asking?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Here, splash a little water on him," your mother suggests, handing you
<b>Floyd</b> | a water bottle with not much water in it. You sprinkle a few drops on
<b>Floyd</b> | the egg's eyes and they flutter a bit before one of them opens.

<b>Floyd</b> | Groaning, the egg sits up. "It is, oh, it truly is you," he sighs
<b>Floyd</b> | happily. Both his eyes open wide then, and he jumps...well, rises as
<b>Floyd</b> | quickly as his awkward shape will allow. "I must inform the
<b>Floyd</b> | authorities," he announces importantly. "Mother Loose, will you be all
<b>Floyd</b> | right? Do you need an ambulance? I can call the king's horses and
<b>Floyd</b> | men--pardon me, I meant troops--pardon me, I meant...oh, dear, oh,

<b>Floyd</b> | dear, I don't know what I meant!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your mother pats the egg's hand calmly. "I just need to go home and
<b>Floyd</b> | rest for a day or two," she says. "I'm perfectly fine, really. I'll
<b>Floyd</b> | call you tomorrow and tell you the whole story, all right?" The egg
<b>Floyd</b> | nods and, with a quick glance over his shoulder, bustles out of the

<b>Floyd</b> | room and down the stairs.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Exhausted, you stand motionless in the center of the room, head down,
<b>Floyd</b> | staring at the kitten winding in and out around your ankles. As you
<b>Floyd</b> | watch, the kitten curls up on your foot, ready for a nap. You wiggle
<b>Floyd</b> | your toes, but the drowsy kitten simply yawns. So do you. When you open

<b>Floyd</b> | your eyes (you can't remember shutting them), the kitten is settled
<b>Floyd</b> | comfortably against your mother's shoulder, purring.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Mother Loose takes your hand in hers. "Come on, sleepyhead," she
<b>Floyd</b> | whispers. "Time to go home."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | And you all live happily ever after.

<b>Floyd</b> | Did you know that you can rescue Mother Loose without getting into any
<b>Floyd</b> | trouble at all? Yep, it's true. But the hints won't help you. Sorry.
<b>Floyd</b> | (Actually, that's not quite true. The hints will help you stay out of

<b>Floyd</b> | here.) By the way, in case you were wondering, staying out of trouble
<b>Floyd</b> | is the only way to score all 50 points. However, a little mischief here

<b>Floyd</b> |      Win friends and influence people by pulling Mary's loose tooth.
