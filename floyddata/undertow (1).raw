The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Undertow</i>, written by Stephen&nbsp;Granade.  <i>Undertow</i> was originally released as part of the 1995 IF Competition, where it took fourth place in the TADS division.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Undertow"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | How did Thom ever talk you into this one...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your friend Thom Hall has always been a smooth talker, which is
<b>Floyd</b> | probably how he got you to attend his party on board the
<b>Floyd</b> | *Bellerophon*.  The fourty-eight-foot yacht is named after the H.M.S.
<b>Floyd</b> | Bellerophon, the ship on which Napoleon formally surrendered in 1815
<b>Floyd</b> | after Waterloo.  Thom isn't usually too modest.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Anyway, you're now stuck at a floating party with three other people
<b>Floyd</b> | you barely know, friends of Thom's.  Bill Leveritt is one of Thom's
<b>Floyd</b> | partners in his architectural firm.  Carl Weathers, another old friend
<b>Floyd</b> | of Thom's, brought his girlfriend Ashleigh Flannagin, which completes
<b>Floyd</b> | the floating fivesome.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So far you've seen Bill and Thom yell at each other, Thom hit Carl for
<b>Floyd</b> | some unexplained reason, and Ashleigh ignore both Thom and you.  Not
<b>Floyd</b> | the most pleasant party you've ever been to.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And it's barely 10 a.m...

<b>Floyd</b> | Bill says, "Um, ok, Carl, what now?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Carl looks at the controls.  "I'd best man the anchor."  He looks at

<b>Floyd</b> | How did Thom ever talk you into this one...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your friend Thom Hall has always been a smooth talker, which is
<b>Floyd</b> | probably how he got you to attend his party on board the
<b>Floyd</b> | *Bellerophon*.  The fourty-eight-foot yacht is named after the H.M.S.
<b>Floyd</b> | Bellerophon, the ship on which Napoleon formally surrendered in 1815

<b>Floyd</b> | after Waterloo.  Thom isn't usually too modest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Anyway, you're now stuck at a floating party with three other people
<b>Floyd</b> | you barely know, friends of Thom's.  Bill Leveritt is one of Thom's
<b>Floyd</b> | partners in his architectural firm.  Carl Weathers, another old friend
<b>Floyd</b> | of Thom's, brought his girlfriend Ashleigh Flannagin, which completes

<b>Floyd</b> | the floating fivesome.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So far you've seen Bill and Thom yell at each other, Thom hit Carl for
<b>Floyd</b> | some unexplained reason, and Ashleigh ignore both Thom and you.  Not
<b>Floyd</b> | the most pleasant party you've ever been to.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | And it's barely 10 a.m...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Shut up!" Bill shouts.  "Just shut up!  All of you!"  His eyes are

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "He wasn't supposed to..."  Bill clears his throat, mopping his face
<b>Floyd</b> | with his left hand.  "Thom was embezzling from our firm.  I would have

<b>Floyd</b> | laughter.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "And when I confronted him with it again, he told me there was no

<b>Floyd</b> | accident!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You've been transfixed by the fact that Bill was able to say all that
<b>Floyd</b> | without one "uh" or "ah," but Carl has been inching closer.  It looks

<b>Floyd</b> | Bill jerks back, swinging the revolver around and firing in the same

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The smell of cordite fills the air as Ashleigh screams.  Carl's eyes

<b>Floyd</b> | widen almost comically, and he staggers back, blood spurting from a

<b>Floyd</b> |    The forecastle of the boat is surprisingly comfortable despite its

<b>Floyd</b> | the port wall, aft of the entrance, is a small bar.  Across from it is

<b>Floyd</b> | How did Thom ever talk you into this one...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your friend Thom Hall has always been a smooth talker, which is
<b>Floyd</b> | probably how he got you to attend his party on board the
<b>Floyd</b> | *Bellerophon*.  The fourty-eight-foot yacht is named after the H.M.S.
<b>Floyd</b> | Bellerophon, the ship on which Napoleon formally surrendered in 1815
<b>Floyd</b> | after Waterloo.  Thom isn't usually too modest.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Anyway, you're now stuck at a floating party with three other people
<b>Floyd</b> | you barely know, friends of Thom's.  Bill Leveritt is one of Thom's
<b>Floyd</b> | partners in his architectural firm.  Carl Weathers, another old friend
<b>Floyd</b> | of Thom's, brought his girlfriend Ashleigh Flannagin, which completes
<b>Floyd</b> | the floating fivesome.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So far you've seen Bill and Thom yell at each other, Thom hit Carl for
<b>Floyd</b> | some unexplained reason, and Ashleigh ignore both Thom and you.  Not
<b>Floyd</b> | the most pleasant party you've ever been to.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And it's barely 10 a.m...

<b>Floyd</b> | A sudden sound startles you.  The companionway is being opened!  Bill
<b>Floyd</b> | climbs down the ladder, revolver pointed at you the whole time.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Where's the whiskey?" he asks you and Ashleigh.  He then sees the
<b>Floyd</b> | bottle.  "Get it for me," he tells you, motioning with the gun.  You
<b>Floyd</b> | comply, handing it to him.  He upends the bottle, drinking all of it

<b>Floyd</b> | before tossing the empty bottle aside.  Bill's eyes suddenly close,
<b>Floyd</b> | much to his surprise.  The muzzle of the gun traces an arc to the
<b>Floyd</b> | floor.  "Sleepy," he mumbles, just before he drops the gun and
<b>Floyd</b> | crumples to the floor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You are left with Ashleigh and Carl's unconscious body to wait for

<b>Floyd</b> | someone to pick you up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In just under an hour, a Coast Guard ship pulls alongside the
<b>Floyd</b> | *Bellerophon*.  All you can think is, why did they take so long?  The
<b>Floyd</b> | three of you are taken in for questioning, and Bill is turned over to
<b>Floyd</b> | the police.  You were fortunate enough to stop Bill before he could

<b>Floyd</b> | kill Carl, even though Carl will limp a bit for the rest of his life.
<b>Floyd</b> | You ferreted out the connection between Carl, Thom, and those
<b>Floyd</b> | pictures; andyou discovered why Ashleigh was after Thom.  All in all,
<b>Floyd</b> | an excellent showing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thank you for playing Undertow.
