<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Casey glances around the newspaper office. "Orchid is gone, right?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yes, she left. Why do you ask?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I wanted to give you this while she wasn't around." He hands you a
<b>Floyd</b> | thick, well-leafed notebook. "It's just kind of a guide kind of thing,
<b>Floyd</b> | with some general information and directions, just to help you get
<b>Floyd</b> | around. Don't let Orchid see it."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Are you sure I'll require so much background material? And why
<b>Floyd</b> | shouldn't Orchid see it?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, Robin," Casey says, and he spins around a chair to sit on it
<b>Floyd</b> | backwards in what he surely thinks is a very casual and friendly pose,
<b>Floyd</b> | "Orchid is a church member, and you're not, and you missed the lock-in,
<b>Floyd</b> | so you don't have a lot of the context that Orchid has. I just wanted
<b>Floyd</b> | to put you on an even footing. And for your second question, I might
<b>Floyd</b> | have written some things in there that I wouldn't have said to Orchid's
<b>Floyd</b> | face."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You nod, and slip the notebook into your backpack. "I'm sure you've
<b>Floyd</b> | adequately prepared me for my mission."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yes, I have. You're welcome. No, wait, I've got one more thing to say.
<b>Floyd</b> | Make sure you take lots of pictures, obviously. It's your job. That's
<b>Floyd</b> | one." He starts counting on his fingers. "Um, it's more fun if you run
<b>Floyd</b> | off by yourself, so make sure you get Sharon off your back. That's two.
<b>Floyd</b> | And keep an open mind. I mean, just because you don't believe in ghosts
<b>Floyd</b> | doesn't mean you're not gonna see one.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "So, yeah. That's three things."

<b>Floyd</b> | Nursery
<b>Floyd</b> | Sharon, in her wisdom, decided that everybody should sleep in this
<b>Floyd</b> | cramped corner of the church basement.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Battered toys spill out of the toybox and across the floor, piling up
<b>Floyd</b> | in a corner of the room. Cupboards are mounted high on the walls, out
<b>Floyd</b> | of reach of tiny fingers, and an enormous blue recliner sits underneath
<b>Floyd</b> | them. It's already dark outside, and the doors west to the basement
<b>Floyd</b> | stairway and south are dark as well.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your sleeping bag is lying on a tidy patch of floor, ready for when you
<b>Floyd</b> | finish your investigation.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Orchid is lounging around, lecturing you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You'd better hold onto this," she says, handing you the camera,
<b>Floyd</b> | "you're the official photographer. Just don't forget, if you see
<b>Floyd</b> | something that might be evidence of a ghost, make sure you take a photo
<b>Floyd</b> | of it."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You slip the camera strap around your neck.

<b>Floyd</b> | [This action may cause some slight lag in the browser version of this
<b>Floyd</b> | game. We sincerely regret any inconvenience.]
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You flick through the notes and read Casey's scrawly handwriting: "I
<b>Floyd</b> | don't know how much you already know about the ghost in the church so
<b>Floyd</b> | I'll give you the whole story. Jennie Bancroft is the name of the ghost
<b>Floyd</b> | that haunts Grace United Methodist. She used to be alive, but then she
<b>Floyd</b> | died, in or around the church, sometime in the distant past. I keep
<b>Floyd</b> | meaning to look up when she died but I haven't had time.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "When people see her, she looks like a teenage girl in pigtails. I
<b>Floyd</b> | don't think she shows up covered in blood or anything like that; she's
<b>Floyd</b> | just a sad girl. Obviously a lot of the time she's invisible though.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Some of the evidence that we have for her existence includes:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | - sounds of footsteps and a girl crying when nobody else is in the
<b>Floyd</b> | church
<b>Floyd</b> | - cold spots in rooms, rooms that suddenly become cold for no reason
<b>Floyd</b> | - stuff goes missing, then shows up again
<b>Floyd</b> | - you see someone at the end of the hallway but when you get to the end
<b>Floyd</b> | of the hallway there's nobody there
<b>Floyd</b> | - basically everybody has seen her out of the corner of their eye at
<b>Floyd</b> | some point
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Debate continues on the subject of how Jennie died. Popular theories
<b>Floyd</b> | state that she jumped off of the church steeple, or she drank poison,
<b>Floyd</b> | or used a space heater to carbon monoxide herself. According to one
<b>Floyd</b> | explanation she died accidentally, because she was using a Ouija board,
<b>Floyd</b> | but that theory is idiotic. Jennie Bancroft definitely committed
<b>Floyd</b> | suicide, and it was definitely because of a boy she was in love with."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sharon continues, "So I'm going to stay here and sleep, and you two are
<b>Floyd</b> | going to get on with your investigating, and not wake me up unless
<b>Floyd</b> | there's a life-threatening emergency or something."

<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm at school after hours because of rehearsals. But we're still in

<b>Floyd</b> | "But Orchid and Aiden Kingsley are already up in the office, and as

<b>Floyd</b> | please!' and I'm like 'Actually, I am an actor,' and she says, 'Well,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "No, Orchid! I do not have the slightest idea what you mean. I would
<b>Floyd</b> | have just grabbed a donut and left, but you're not allowed to take the

<b>Floyd</b> | "I wouldn't say I hate Orchid. Hate is a very strong word. I completely

<b>Floyd</b> | ghost that haunts Grace United Methodist. She used to be alive, but
<b>Floyd</b> | then she died, in or around the church, sometime in the distant past.
<b>Floyd</b> | I keep meaning to look up when she died but I haven't had time.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "When people see her, she looks like a teenage girl in pigtails. I
<b>Floyd</b> | don't think she shows up covered in blood or anything like that; she's
<b>Floyd</b> | just a sad girl. Obviously a lot of the time she's invisible though.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Some of the evidence that we have for her existence includes:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | - sounds of footsteps and a girl crying when nobody else is in the
<b>Floyd</b> | church
<b>Floyd</b> | - cold spots in rooms, rooms that suddenly become cold for no reason
<b>Floyd</b> | - stuff goes missing, then shows up again
<b>Floyd</b> | - you see someone at the end of the hallway but when you get to the
<b>Floyd</b> | end of the hallway there's nobody there
<b>Floyd</b> | - basically everybody has seen her out of the corner of their eye at
<b>Floyd</b> | some point
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Debate continues on the subject of how Jennie died. Popular theories
<b>Floyd</b> | state that she jumped off of the church steeple, or she drank poison,
<b>Floyd</b> | or used a space heater to carbon monoxide herself. According to one
<b>Floyd</b> | explanation she died accidentally, because she was using a Ouija

<b>Floyd</b> | This room can't be as large as it seems. It certainly didn't look so

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Near the southern exit is a rolltop desk. Up at the north end of the

<b>Floyd</b> | There isn't really any room in here for anything except the stairs up

<b>Floyd</b> | A large part of this room is taken up by a rickety ping pong table.
<b>Floyd</b> | Couches line the edges of the room, some of them close enough to the
<b>Floyd</b> | table that they're probably not safe to sit on if someone is actually
<b>Floyd</b> | playing ping pong. On the other hand, you can't see any ping pong bats
<b>Floyd</b> | anywhere, so maybe that's not an issue. In between the couches, doors
<b>Floyd</b> | lead north to the nursery, west to the Sunday School room, and south
<b>Floyd</b> | to the black light make-out room.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sunday School Room</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | This is a room designed for small people. Low benches are arranged
<b>Floyd</b> | like pews in two rows, facing toward a small table that serves as an
<b>Floyd</b> | altar. A poster explaining the Ten Commandments hangs on one wall, and
<b>Floyd</b> | doors lead north to the basement stairway, east to the youth room and

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Basement Stairway</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | This room is apparently just for show; there are no tables or chairs.
<b>Floyd</b> | A wide staircase runs up to the main floor of the church, and doorways

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fellowship Hall</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | This room is a bit crowded for your tastes: between the many round
<b>Floyd</b> | tables, each surrounded by a complement of folding chairs, there isn't
<b>Floyd</b> | much space to get from one end of the room to the other. The main
<b>Floyd</b> | stairway is north, the kitchen is east, and the narthex is west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One corner is given over to a glass case containing a model church.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Narthex</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | The main entryway to the church, this room has been set up to be as
<b>Floyd</b> | welcoming as possible. A rack of pamphlets sits in the center of a
<b>Floyd</b> | large table, flanked by pots of fake flowers. Lying open on a podium
<b>Floyd</b> | is a huge Bible. Pinned up on one wall is a board full of name tags.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To the east is the fellowship hall, and the large passage to the north
<b>Floyd</b> | obviously leads to the main sanctuary. The way out of the church is
<b>Floyd</b> | south of here, but that's none of your concern currently.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sanctuary</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | This room can't be as large as it seems. It certainly didn't look so
<b>Floyd</b> | huge from outside. It must be some kind of optical illusion, created
<b>Floyd</b> | by the angles of the vaulted ceiling or the long rows of pews.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Near the southern exit is a rolltop desk. Up at the north end of the
<b>Floyd</b> | room is the altar, and the east stairway must lead up to the balcony.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is dark outside, and the stained glass windows are dull and
<b>Floyd</b> | lifeless.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Altar</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | A few steps up from the pews to the south are the preacher's pulpit,
<b>Floyd</b> | the altar, and the American and Christian flags. Behind them, to the
<b>Floyd</b> | north, is a tiny doorway.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the altar are two candles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A large cross hangs high on the wall above the altar.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Back Room</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | This is a far cry from the grandeur of the sanctuary. The walls are
<b>Floyd</b> | covered in some kind of dark wood panels, but they're shabby and
<b>Floyd</b> | windowless, and the floor is bare concrete. A huge wooden chest and a
<b>Floyd</b> | closet full of robes take up one wall. You can head back out to the
<b>Floyd</b> | altar to the south, or try the sliding door to the north.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Some more ectoplasm is smeared on the floor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Behind the sliding door you find a steep, narrow flight of stairs with
<b>Floyd</b> | no handrail. You walk down them slowly, not wanting to miss your
<b>Floyd</b> | footing in the dim light.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Tunnel</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | You could hardly call this a room. It's just a long, musty, narrow
<b>Floyd</b> | space behind a wall. At one end, a flight of stairs runs up to the
<b>Floyd</b> | room behind the altar; at the other end a heavy door leads out to the
<b>Floyd</b> | south. In between them, a fuse box is mounted on the wall, its metal
<b>Floyd</b> | door hanging open to reveal a row of switches.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A cheap-looking mirror, a black sphere and some black cloth are lying

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">End of Hallway</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | The hall ends here at a heavy door to the north. A huge mural of David
<b>Floyd</b> | fighting Goliath adorns the west wall, but it's marred by a streak of
<b>Floyd</b> | gray gunk clinging to the wall.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Echoing footsteps draw your attention to a figure walking down the
<b>Floyd</b> | south end of the hallway, but whoever it is goes into the Sunday
<b>Floyd</b> | School room before you can see their face.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | A huge rainbow arches across the wall in this part of the hallway.
<b>Floyd</b> | Underneath it, a door leads west, with an identical door opposite on
<b>Floyd</b> | the east wall.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | The hallway continues to run north and south. The wall here is taken
<b>Floyd</b> | up by a mural of a beached whale and a man lying on the sand.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see an open can of tuna here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Hallway</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | The hallway runs north, past the plywood lighthouse, all the way up to
<b>Floyd</b> | the door to the tunnel. A doorway to the east leads into the Sunday
<b>Floyd</b> | School room, and on the wall opposite it is the mural of Jesus
<b>Floyd</b> | blessing the little children.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sunday School Room</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | This is a room designed for small people. Low benches are arranged
<b>Floyd</b> | like pews in two rows, facing toward a small table that serves as an
<b>Floyd</b> | altar. A poster explaining the Ten Commandments hangs on one wall, and
<b>Floyd</b> | doors lead north to the basement stairway, east to the youth room and
<b>Floyd</b> | west to the hallway.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Basement Stairway</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | This room is apparently just for show; there are no tables or chairs.
<b>Floyd</b> | A wide staircase runs up to the main floor of the church, and doorways
<b>Floyd</b> | lead east to the nursery, south to the Sunday School room and north to
<b>Floyd</b> | the boiler room. Mounted on the wall is a gigantic abstract painting.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The TV trolley is standing in the middle of the room, looking lonely.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | From here, you could head north to the boiler room, south to the

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Main Floor Stairway</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | This room forms a sort of nook off the fellowship hall to the south. A
<b>Floyd</b> | wide flight of stairs leads down to the basement. There are doors to
<b>Floyd</b> | the north, northeast and southeast; according to the plaques on them,
<b>Floyd</b> | they open onto the pastor's office, the men's restroom and the ladies'
<b>Floyd</b> | restroom respectively.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A vast framed poster is hanging on the wall in between the restroom
<b>Floyd</b> | doors, and in the middle of the room, directly facing the poster, is a
<b>Floyd</b> | wooden bench.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Fellowship Hall</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | This room is a bit crowded for your tastes: between the many round
<b>Floyd</b> | tables, each surrounded by a complement of folding chairs, there isn't
<b>Floyd</b> | much space to get from one end of the room to the other. The main
<b>Floyd</b> | stairway is north, the kitchen is east, and the narthex is west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One corner is given over to a glass case containing a model church.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Narthex</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | The main entryway to the church, this room has been set up to be as
<b>Floyd</b> | welcoming as possible. A rack of pamphlets sits in the center of a
<b>Floyd</b> | large table, flanked by pots of fake flowers. Lying open on a podium
<b>Floyd</b> | is a huge Bible. Pinned up on one wall is a board full of name tags.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To the east is the fellowship hall, and the large passage to the north
<b>Floyd</b> | obviously leads to the main sanctuary. The way out of the church is
<b>Floyd</b> | south of here, but that's none of your concern currently.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sanctuary</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | This room can't be as large as it seems. It certainly didn't look so
<b>Floyd</b> | huge from outside. It must be some kind of optical illusion, created
<b>Floyd</b> | by the angles of the vaulted ceiling or the long rows of pews.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Near the southern exit is a rolltop desk. Up at the north end of the
<b>Floyd</b> | room is the altar, and the east stairway must lead up to the balcony.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is dark outside, and the stained glass windows are dull and
<b>Floyd</b> | lifeless.

<b>Floyd</b> | older kids play angels or Mary and Joseph or the wise men, and while
<b>Floyd</b> | every older kid ends up having to sing a song at some point, the
<b>Floyd</b> | shepherds do not. I think Orchid wanted them to sing 'Silent Night',
<b>Floyd</b> | which is a pretty good choice for little kids to sing. I will admit
<b>Floyd</b> | that Orchid made a good call here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "But Marcie did not agree. I'm pretty sure Marcie thinks that because
<b>Floyd</b> | it's impossible to get little kids to carry a tune or understand
<b>Floyd</b> | Italian music vocabulary, nobody wants to hear them sing in church,
<b>Floyd</b> | which is a critical misconception and I think indicates some sort of
<b>Floyd</b> | psychological defect in Marcie Kempulfers's brain. Anyway.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Marcie made up this insane justification to have the bell choir play
<b>Floyd</b> | 'Silent Night' instead. She said the bell choir had already practiced
<b>Floyd</b> | it, which was technically true, although specifically they had

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "So she got her dad to build this crazy device, the Engelgurt, which

<b>Floyd</b> | across a room, like an angel.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "A couple nights before the Christmas program, Orchid and her dad came
<b>Floyd</b> | in and set up the Engelgurt while nobody else was around. I mean, I

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The night of the program came around and for a while everything went

<b>Floyd</b> | "In like, I think freshman year, Patrick the youth leader had this

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "And, because we were freshmen and not yet completely jaded by the

<b>Floyd</b> | But on the day of the big event it turned out, in a revelation that

<b>Floyd</b> | canning preserves is a pretty complicated process with steps beyond
<b>Floyd</b> | just mashing up fruit and putting it into jars. And if you mess it up
<b>Floyd</b> | then your jam will give people salmonella and they'll die.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | room behind the altar; at the other end a heavy door leads out to the
<b>Floyd</b> | south. In between them, a fuse box is mounted on the wall, its metal
<b>Floyd</b> | door hanging open to reveal a row of switches.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A cheap-looking mirror, a black sphere and some black cloth are lying
<b>Floyd</b> | in a heap on the floor.

<b>Floyd</b> | This is a far cry from the grandeur of the sanctuary. The walls are
<b>Floyd</b> | covered in some kind of dark wood panels, but they're shabby and
<b>Floyd</b> | windowless, and the floor is bare concrete. A huge wooden chest and a
<b>Floyd</b> | closet full of robes take up one wall. You can head back out to the
<b>Floyd</b> | altar to the south, or try the sliding door to the north.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A stack of hymnals is crammed into one corner.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Some more ectoplasm is smeared on the floor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Altar</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | A few steps up from the pews to the south are the preacher's pulpit,
<b>Floyd</b> | the altar, and the American and Christian flags. Behind them, to the
<b>Floyd</b> | north, is a tiny doorway.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the altar are two candles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A large cross hangs high on the wall above the altar.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Sanctuary</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | This room can't be as large as it seems. It certainly didn't look so
<b>Floyd</b> | huge from outside. It must be some kind of optical illusion, created
<b>Floyd</b> | by the angles of the vaulted ceiling or the long rows of pews.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Near the southern exit is a rolltop desk. Up at the north end of the
<b>Floyd</b> | room is the altar, and the east stairway must lead up to the balcony.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is dark outside, and the stained glass windows are dull and

<b>Floyd</b> | Sharon, in her wisdom, decided that everybody should sleep in this

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Battered toys spill out of the toybox and across the floor, piling up
<b>Floyd</b> | in a corner of the room. Cupboards are mounted high on the walls, out
<b>Floyd</b> | of reach of tiny fingers, and an enormous blue recliner sits
<b>Floyd</b> | underneath them. It's already dark outside, and the doors west to the
<b>Floyd</b> | basement stairway and south are dark as well.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your sleeping bag is lying on a tidy patch of floor, ready for when

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Orchid is lounging around, lecturing you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You'd better hold onto this," she says, handing you the camera,
<b>Floyd</b> | "you're the official photographer. Just don't forget, if you see
<b>Floyd</b> | something that might be evidence of a ghost, make sure you take a
<b>Floyd</b> | photo of it."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You slip the camera strap around your neck.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The ghost's glowing dress lies in a heap nearby. It doesn't look very

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Standing here, you have a good view of the altar and most of the

<b>Floyd</b> | though it probably also obscures the view for anyone sitting on the
<b>Floyd</b> | balcony pews. A projector is mounted at one end of the pews, pointing
<b>Floyd</b> | down towards the front of the sanctuary. Behind the pews you can see
<b>Floyd</b> | the ladder up to the steeple, and a narrow staircase leads back down
<b>Floyd</b> | to the sanctuary.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The orange box is sitting upside down on the floor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A tangled heap of bars and cables is lying near the edge of the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You look back to make sure Aiden has followed you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yes. Now I'll tell you the answer to your question. Of course Orchid

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He tries to slip past you, but you grab his arm.

<b>Floyd</b> | The main entryway to the church, this room has been set up to be as

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To the east is the fellowship hall, and the large passage to the north

<b>Floyd</b> | As you enter the narthex, Orchid strolls in through the front door of

<b>Floyd</b> | "Aiden! What are you doing here?"

<b>Floyd</b> | "Hey. Don't bother," Aiden snaps. "I've already told her everything.
