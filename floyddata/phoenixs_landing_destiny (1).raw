The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript for the remaining third of the 2008 IntroComp entries <A HREF="http://www.allthingsjacq.com/intfic_clubfloyd_20080901.html">not played previously</A>, in the following order: <i>Phoenix's&nbsp;Landing:&nbsp;Destiny</i>, by Carolyn&nbsp;VanEseltine; and <I>Nine-Tenths&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Law</I>, by Jack&nbsp;Welch.  These games were originally released as part of the 2008 IntroComp.  You can learn more about these games, including how to download them, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/IntroComp_2008"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Welcome to Phoenix's Landing!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This is an interactive fiction game (or, if you prefer, a text

<b>Floyd</b> | adventure game.)  You can interact with this game through a variety of
<b>Floyd</b> | commands.  The commands you enter will cause your viewpoint character
<b>Floyd</b> | (the "you") to take certain actions, and, as various actions are taken,

<b>Floyd</b> | the story will unfold.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With rare exception, you can enter commands whenever you see a &gt;.  (The

<b>Floyd</b> | most notable exception is if you are having a conversation, in which
<b>Floyd</b> | case you will have to finish your conversation first.  You will know
<b>Floyd</b> | that you are in a conversation if the game has supplied you with a

<b>Floyd</b> | numbered list of potential conversation responses.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Here are some useful commands....

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | HELP will show you this message.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | LOOK (or L) will show what is around you.
<b>Floyd</b> | EXAMINE &lt;object&gt; (or X &lt;object&gt;) will take a closer look at a specific

<b>Floyd</b> | object.
<b>Floyd</b> | INVENTORY (or I) will show you what you are carrying.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When you want to manipulate an item, try commands like GET &lt;object&gt;,
<b>Floyd</b> | DROP &lt;object&gt;, WEAR &lt;object&gt;, REMOVE &lt;object&gt;, and PUT &lt;object&gt; IN/ON


<b>Floyd</b> | &lt;another object&gt;.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When you want to talk to someone, you can TALK TO &lt;person&gt;.  Sometimes,
<b>Floyd</b> | other people will talk to you of their own accord.  When you are
<b>Floyd</b> | conversing with someone, you will be presented with a list of numbered


<b>Floyd</b> | options.  Type in the number you want on each turn in order to continue
<b>Floyd</b> | through the conversation.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When you want to move from place to place, try commands like EAST,
<b>Floyd</b> | WEST, NORTH, and SOUTH, or RETREAT (which will take you back in
<b>Floyd</b> | whichever direction you just came from).  You can also SIT, STAND,


<b>Floyd</b> | KNEEL, and LIE to assume different positions.  It is more comfortable
<b>Floyd</b> | to SIT ON CHAIR than to sit on the ground, though you can only do this
<b>Floyd</b> | if there is a chair nearby.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Occasionally, it is useful to take a moment and THINK ABOUT something,
<b>Floyd</b> | such as one of the gods, one of the races, or someone that you have


<b>Floyd</b> | met.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you don't want to do anything at all, you can WAIT and see what
<b>Floyd</b> | happens next.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Important commands also include QUIT, SAVE, RESTORE, and RESTART.  They


<b>Floyd</b> | do exactly what they sound like.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | These are the most important commands, but they are not the only
<b>Floyd</b> | commands implemented in the game.  When in doubt, experiment!  You may
<b>Floyd</b> | be surprised by what you can do.
<b>Floyd</b> |


<b>Floyd</b> | Have fun, and good luck!

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In a place that was no place at all, three presences gathered.  One was


<b>Floyd</b> | dead, one would never die, and one existed somewhere in between.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Undying commanded the ghost, *Speak, as you spoke to me.*
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The ghost, a translucent, haggard man, showed fear in every quiver of
<b>Floyd</b> | his insubstantial being, yet he spoke before the Presences.  "My lords,


<b>Floyd</b> | when I was born, a geas and star were cast upon my path.  There was a
<b>Floyd</b> | deed that I was fated to do, yet I was torn from life before it could
<b>Floyd</b> | be completed.  This was not in the stars, and it was not in my fate,
<b>Floyd</b> | yet it came to be.  I have been wronged."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | *You have been wronged.*  It was the Other, and each word twisted the


<b>Floyd</b> | shape of the ghost's existence.  *Yet past is past, and done is done.
<b>Floyd</b> | You cannot return to life.  You must go on.*
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | *Yet who could alter what I set into motion?*  The Undying's words were
<b>Floyd</b> | stern, and, like the Other's words, they beat upon the ghost and caused
<b>Floyd</b> | the ghost to vibrate like a bell.  *There are few who could change this


<b>Floyd</b> | soul's path, and only one who would.  There must be an answer for
<b>Floyd</b> | this.*
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | *We will answer between ourselves, then,* said the Other.  *It is
<b>Floyd</b> | nothing to this ghost.  I will send him on his way.*
<b>Floyd</b> |


<b>Floyd</b> | *No,* said the Undying.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There was a pause.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | *no?* said the Other, and, with that soft syllable, a cold wind raced
<b>Floyd</b> | over every leaf in some faraway forest.


<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |

</PRE></td><td></td>
<TD><b>CarolynV</b>  says, "I swiped RETREAT from someone, but I can't remember who -- possibly it was an example from the documentation?.  It was more of a 'someday this will be useful' command than anything else...."

<TR><td></td><TD></TD><td></td><TD><b>Jacqueline</b>  says, "It's a neat verb idea to include.  I'll have to remember that."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |


<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | *No,* said the Undying.   *For he accepted his path and his fate, and,


<b>Floyd</b> | in accepting, he gave all that he was.  Mortal though he is, he lost
<b>Floyd</b> | all, and he has earned protection.  In the name of the King, I claim
<b>Floyd</b> | his redemption.*
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | *What is dead is dead, and dead shall not breathe,* the Other said
<b>Floyd</b> | indifferently.  *He is lost, and he rots beneath the stones.*


<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | *But I will mark his path again,* said the Undying.  *And I will set
<b>Floyd</b> | another upon that path, and I will send this ghost to watch over his
<b>Floyd</b> | successor.  If his successor accepts the path as deeply and fully as
<b>Floyd</b> | he, then that one will reap where this one has sowed.  And I call upon
<b>Floyd</b> | you to witness and to obey.*


<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There was a silence like the silence before a storm, when the very sky
<b>Floyd</b> | draws breath, but there was no sky in this place that was not a place.

<b>Floyd</b> | I, too, have my rights.  I, too, am among the stars, though I stretch


<b>Floyd</b> | beyond them as well.*
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | *You are among the stars,* said the Undying.  *I accept your obedience,
<b>Floyd</b> | and I accept your claim.*
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Other considered.  *Then this path is mine, as well, to shape.  A

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The Other turned its attention to the ghost.  *We will choose, you and


<b>Floyd</b> | I, until the clay of your successor's being is created.  This, I will
<b>Floyd</b> | choose first: your successor's gender.  She will be she, as you have
<b>Floyd</b> | been he, thus creating balance.  Balance,* the Other added to the
<b>Floyd</b> | Undying, not unsardonically, *is of the essence.*
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | *So let it be,* the Undying replied blandly.  Then, to the ghost: *It


<b>Floyd</b> | is your choice, now.*
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And in the place that was no place, a concept came, and another, until
<b>Floyd</b> | nine concepts were arrayed before the ghost.  The ghost perceived these
<b>Floyd</b> | nine:
<b>Floyd</b> |


<b>Floyd</b> | a sword - the concept of Power
<b>Floyd</b> | a spiderweb - the concept of Agility
<b>Floyd</b> | a dandelion - the concept of Endurance
<b>Floyd</b> | a book - the concept of Brilliance
<b>Floyd</b> | a mask - the concept of Cunning
<b>Floyd</b> | a candle - the concept of Awareness


<b>Floyd</b> | a crown - the concept of Presence
<b>Floyd</b> | a rose - the concept of Guile
<b>Floyd</b> | a jewel - the concept of Serenity
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | *Choose,* said the Undying, *and what you choose will be born in your
<b>Floyd</b> | successor.*


<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Before The Story
<b>Floyd</b> | There was no up, no down, no north, no south, no dawn, and no dusk.
<b>Floyd</b> | This was a place that is no place at all.  The passing of time itself
<b>Floyd</b> | was all but meaningless -- yet there was meaning in the passage of


<b>Floyd</b> | time; not much, but enough that three presences gathered here
<b>Floyd</b> | meaningfully, and enough that they could converse.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The ghost perceived a sword, a spiderweb, a dandelion, a book, a mask,
<b>Floyd</b> | a candle, a crown, a rose, and a jewel.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's the first time that you've been allowed to travel on a trading

<b>Floyd</b> | mission.  All your life has been secluded within the confines of a
<b>Floyd</b> | mountain cavern-town far to the west, but this year, your

<b>Floyd</b> | creche-fathers agreed that you should accompany your tradefather
<b>Floyd</b> | instead of the assistant that your tradefather normally hires for the
<b>Floyd</b> | journey.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | After weeks of travel (first down the rocky slopes and through rambling
<b>Floyd</b> | hills, and then through the twisting, shadowy forests) you get your

<b>Floyd</b> | first real look at the city of Phoenix's Landing.  Above the tall stone
<b>Floyd</b> | walls, you can see the tops of the buildings.  Two towers at the center
<b>Floyd</b> | rise highest of all, and, from your tradefather's stories over the
<b>Floyd</b> | years, you recognize them immediately as the temple to Ivrul and the

<b>Floyd</b> | governance hall.  Golden fields border the city to the west and south,
<b>Floyd</b> | with a few small buildings clumped here and there.  The dark face of

<b>Floyd</b> | Char Cliff rises above it to the north, marking the base of First
<b>Floyd</b> | Mountain.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When you raise your eyes to First Mountain, the city seems no larger

<b>Floyd</b> | than a child's city built from shards of fallen stone.  The city
<b>Floyd</b> | nestles beneath the cliff as a pup to its mother, yet it is larger than

<b>Floyd</b> | any city you have ever seen.  You have no plans to visit the chiroptera
<b>Floyd</b> | here, but you know that other creche-clans dwell in the range beyond
<b>Floyd</b> | Char Cliff, and the thought is oddly comforting.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | But -- the city!  You can see it more clearly, now, and excitement
<b>Floyd</b> | bubbles up within you.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To journey through the shadowy forests, you joined a caravan, and now
<b>Floyd</b> | the mounted guardsmen scatter forward and back, tending to their
<b>Floyd</b> | various claims since the forest's dangers are receding away.  The

<b>Floyd</b> | boredom of the past week fades as you bounce slightly on the seat of
<b>Floyd</b> | your wagon and strain to see more.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Each wagon has to pause for inspection at the guard house on the near
<b>Floyd</b> | side of the bridge.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You are far enough back in the line of wagons to grow deeply impatient
<b>Floyd</b> | as you wait for your opportunity to enter the city.  Once the wagon has

<b>Floyd</b> | been inspected, it clatters over the broad, flat bridge and passes
<b>Floyd</b> | through the gates into the milling city beyond.  You catch only a few
<b>Floyd</b> | brief glimpses of the buildings beyond.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Then it is your turn.  Your wagon rolls forward over the rutted road
<b>Floyd</b> | and halts.  "Inspection," the shaghal guard growls.  "All parties

<b>Floyd</b> | present themselves."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At your father's signal, you hop down from the wagon.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Leaving the wagon behind, you cross the broad bridge and enter the vast

<b>Floyd</b> | city from its western gate.  "This is West Flame Gate," Hachachi says
<b>Floyd</b> | conversationally, "and people call this neighborhood the Silver
<b>Floyd</b> | District.  You'll bring your wagon through this way later this evening.
<b>Floyd</b> | Over there is the Full Cup, a very good inn -- I recommend the ale

<b>Floyd</b> | highly."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | He continues to converse as you move through the city, but the sound
<b>Floyd</b> | flows around you like the mountain wind -- present, but disregarded.
<b>Floyd</b> | You pay more attention to the various wagons in the market square you
<b>Floyd</b> | pass, to the way passersby part for the young priest, to the low

<b>Floyd</b> | buildings on all sides, and to the people -- so many people!  You have
<b>Floyd</b> | never seen so many people in all your life, let alone all in one place.

<b>Floyd</b> | From your father's past stories, you know that this was once a chirop
<b>Floyd</b> | town, but that many humans and shaghal moved here as the city grew in
<b>Floyd</b> | prominence, and now it is a notable center of trade.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | In your heart, you had somehow pictured a town like your home, but the
<b>Floyd</b> | buildings surrounding you are very different from the caves where you

<b>Floyd</b> | grew up.  You did not know there were so many chirop clans in all the
<b>Floyd</b> | world, and here, those clanmembers mingle with an equal number of
<b>Floyd</b> | humans and scattered groups of shaghal.  You are comforted by the
<b>Floyd</b> | presence of your father.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Looking forward, you see a bridge at the end of the street, and, beyond

<b>Floyd</b> | that bridge, you see a white spire that can only be the governance
<b>Floyd</b> | hall.  The governance hall and the temple of Ivrul are placed upon an
<b>Floyd</b> | island at the center of the city, and now, you are close enough to
<b>Floyd</b> | glimpse sunlight sparkling off the surrounding waters.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A wide-shouldered human woman stands to the left of the bridge's base.

<b>Floyd</b> | Like the shaghal guard at the gate, she bears the scarlet and silver
<b>Floyd</b> | crest of Phoenix's Landing on one shoulder, though she carries a spear
<b>Floyd</b> | instead of an axe.  Hachachi nods a greeting to the human guard, who
<b>Floyd</b> | nods briefly in return and gestures you across the bridge.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There are tiled paths here rather than cobbled streets, and Hachachi

<b>Floyd</b> | turns left along one of those paths, guiding you past the governance
<b>Floyd</b> | building and toward four buildings standing in a cluster.  The tallest
<b>Floyd</b> | of these by far is the silver spire that you saw before, which you
<b>Floyd</b> | recognized as the spire of Ivrul of the Mists.  That, however, is not

<b>Floyd</b> | your destination.  Instead, the priest escorts you to a stately
<b>Floyd</b> | building of grey marble, and you walk beneath an archway marked with a

<b>Floyd</b> | silver star.  This is the temple of Ferran of the Stars.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Beyond the archway is a courtyard, and you pass through the courtyard,
<b>Floyd</b> | through the doors, and down a short hall before entering a

<b>Floyd</b> | silver-walled chamber.  The most noteable feature of the room is a
<b>Floyd</b> | stunning blue tapestry depicting a heron among reeds.  A human woman

<b>Floyd</b> | garbed in black leather is seated to one side.

<b>Floyd</b> | patriarch of the gods.  After the desecration of Ivrul of the Mists,

<b>Floyd</b> | Ferran came to Ivrul in shame and sorrow because she was of his creche
<b>Floyd</b> | and Ferran had not protected her.  From the mists that are Ivrul's
<b>Floyd</b> | domain, Ferran created the greater chiroptera to serve and protect her
<b>Floyd</b> | from above and the lesser chiroptera to serve and protect her from
<b>Floyd</b> | below.  We are the lesser chiroptera, thirdborn by Ferran's hand.  When

<b>Floyd</b> | we act to protect others and to guard our families, we are Ferran's

<b>Floyd</b> | eyes in the darkness, just as the stars are Ferran's eyes in the sky.

<b>Floyd</b> | watch over the world and aid those in need.  To aid people in being

<b>Floyd</b> | "But these are not the only stars in the sky.  In Sarvath's absence,

<b>Floyd</b> | while still honoring his vows, Ferran turned to serve Adisha the Queen.

<b>Floyd</b> | At times, he will present truths to his Queen through the dance of the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And that is exactly what happens -- you storm into the hallway, with

<b>Floyd</b> | High Caerwyn and Hachachi on your heels.  Before you can corner an
<b>Floyd</b> | acolyte and demand your possessions, Caerwyn sends Hachachi to find
<b>Floyd</b> | them, and then you bar them both out of another greeting chamber (the

<b>Floyd</b> | Rat, this time) while you get dressed and verify that all your
<b>Floyd</b> | possessions are still intact.  After sliding your zircon earrings back
<b>Floyd</b> | into place, you open the door once more.

<b>Floyd</b> | The delay has given the high priestess time to regroup, but you ignore
<b>Floyd</b> | her entirely, and she stops just short of laying hands upon you or
<b>Floyd</b> | commanding Hachachi to do so.  You take advantage of the hesitation

<b>Floyd</b> | before the changes her mind.  It is only a short walk to the temple
<b>Floyd</b> | courtyard, and from there, you are free.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | That was a wild risk to take.  They might have helped you, in the long
<b>Floyd</b> | term -- or imprisoned you in the short term.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "If you really thought so, you would have spoken up before now," you
<b>Floyd</b> | whisper back to the ghost.  "They worship the stars.  If my path is in
<b>Floyd</b> | the stars, they have no choice about it."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Are you always this touchy with the clergy?
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Only when they poison me."  But the tide of fury slowly ebbs as you
<b>Floyd</b> | face your situation.  You are now in the largest city you have ever
<b>Floyd</b> | seen, with no friends, no map, only the vaguest possible idea of where

<b>Floyd</b> | your father might be, and a nameless ghost riding along in your mind.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You go south because the bridges off the Spires are south.  There's

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The process of alignment may be gradual, so we have provided several
<b>Floyd</b> | tools, found in the adjoining chambers, to aid you along the way.


<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | p.s. Sorry about the lousy poetry -- it is an unavoidable part of the

Rabbit Den
A relatively large chamber which has been dug in moist clay-like soil. Plant
roots penetrate through the ceilings and walls. The tunnel leads upwards,
back to the surface.

You can see a wall of solid carrot here.

&gt;f eat wall
That's not a verb I recognise.

&gt;eat wall
(the wall of solid carrot)
That's your fibre quota for this hexany....perhaps you can go south now.

&gt;f s
That's not a verb I recognise.

&gt;s

Rabbit Treasure Chamber
A chamber that the rabbit and his lapine ancestors have filled with collected
treasure over the ages. A small opening in the floor leads to a narrow metal
chute. A larger rabbit den is to the north.

You can see an ebony key here.

&gt;f get key
That's not a verb I recognise.

&gt;get key
Taken.

&gt;enter chute
Once you enter the chute, you realise how slick it is, and find yourself
whipping around and around in an ever-descending spiral. Finally, you come to
rest on a metal door. The door clicks open, and you fall to the floor. The
metal door slams shut above you, melding undetectably into the vaulted ceiling.

Vaulted Junction
This room is remarkable for its high, arched ceiling which almost gives you
the impression of being outside at night. An inclined metal shaft leads off to
the west, there is some sort of tiled chamber to the east, and there is a
frozen cavern to the south. In addition, a steep spiral stairway leads down.
A sign is engraved into the wall near the top of the stairs.</PRE>

<b>Floyd</b> | Frog Room

<b>Floyd</b> | A round room with domed ceiling. Every surface is covered in small,

<b>Floyd</b> | The scene is reinforced by a continuous chorus of croaking which

<b>Floyd</b> | south of the cabin, there is a small, well-tended garden. A dirt lane
<b>Floyd</b> | leads towards the east, where it joins up with the road into town.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see two herbs (an herb with blue flowers and an herb with

<b>Floyd</b> | yellow flowers) here.

<b>Floyd</b> | Desolate Road
<b>Floyd</b> | To the west, you can make out a cabin at the edge of the woods. The

<b>Floyd</b> | woods come right to the edge of the road, except on the north side
<b>Floyd</b> | where there is a small strip of meadow.

<b>Floyd</b> | Dirt Road

<b>Floyd</b> | A wheel-rutted single lane runs east and west. You are at the bottom of
<b>Floyd</b> | a path that leads upwards to the peak of a small mountain, while the
<b>Floyd</b> | road is bordered by dense woods. There is a small signpost here.

<b>Floyd</b> | Sloping Path
<b>Floyd</b> | At the top, the winding path is little more than a depression in the

<b>Floyd</b> | gravel and mud, but lower down the mountain, it becomes more defined,
<b>Floyd</b> | and perhaps even sees occasional use. Near the bottom of the path a
<b>Floyd</b> | dirt road is visible.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Hilltop
<b>Floyd</b> | A craggy, windswept patch of dirt atop the smallest in a vast range of

<b>Floyd</b> | mountains. A barely visible path leads down the mountain. An opening
<b>Floyd</b> | leads north into the mountain itself.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You can see a fleshy white polyp and a shackle-bound zombie arm here.

<b>Floyd</b> | Hall Of Welcome
<b>Floyd</b> | An austere room with plain, white marble walls and a polished floor of

<b>Floyd</b> | checkered black and white tile. Through the remnants of the ancient
<b>Floyd</b> | entranceway, only the barest sliver of pale daylight penetrates the

<b>Floyd</b> | room (not that it matters...for you, at least). There is an open marble
<b>Floyd</b> | door at the north end of the room.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see a wooden bowl (which is empty) and a sculpture here.

<b>Floyd</b> | open speckled door leads northward. The room is panelled in dark wood,
<b>Floyd</b> | and has an arched wooden ceiling and grey, stone floor. Near the middle
<b>Floyd</b> | of of the room, there is a sink inset into the east wall. It looks like

<b>Floyd</b> | there is some sort of hole in the middle of the floor near the north

<b>Floyd</b> | Portrait Gallery
<b>Floyd</b> | A long hall lined with a collection of portraits of men and women in
<b>Floyd</b> | priestly robes.  Some of the faces seem vaguely familiar to you.  There
<b>Floyd</b> | must be hexanies of them here.  One picture frame stands out in

<b>Floyd</b> | particular, an empty frame at the north end of the hall.  There is an
<b>Floyd</b> | open speckled door at the south end of the hall. To the north, there is

<b>Floyd</b> | an open archway which leads to an icy cavern.

<b>Floyd</b> | The temperature drops as you enter this long, echoing chamber. The

<b>Floyd</b> | substance. The walls, on the whole, look rubbery. As you contemplate

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Hall Of Cold Logic
<b>Floyd</b> | The white ceiling and floor of the room are entirely unremarkable
<b>Floyd</b> | except for their unusual slickness. You can see exits near the centre
<b>Floyd</b> | of the north and south walls. You are dead-centre in the middle of the

<b>Floyd</b> | Vaulted Junction
<b>Floyd</b> | This room is remarkable for its high, arched ceiling which almost gives
<b>Floyd</b> | you the impression of being outside at night. An inclined metal shaft
<b>Floyd</b> | leads off to the west, there is some sort of tiled chamber to the east,

<b>Floyd</b> | and there is a frozen cavern to the south. In addition, a steep spiral
<b>Floyd</b> | stairway leads down. A sign is engraved into the wall near the top of
