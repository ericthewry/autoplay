The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Divis Mortis</i>, written by Lynnea Dally.  <I>Divis Mortis</I> was originally released as part of the 2010 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took eleventh place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Divis_Mortis'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You let out a deep and painful moan as you slowly realize you are
<b>Floyd</b> | awake on a cold, tiled surface.  Judging by the ache in your head and
<b>Floyd</b> | bones, you've been hit with a lead pipe and left to rot.  You grope at
<b>Floyd</b> | your head, but you can't feel anything, not through the thick rubber
<b>Floyd</b> | gloves you're wearing at any rate.  You flop over and moan again at
<b>Floyd</b> | the bright lights coming from the ceiling.  Your arm half-heartedly
<b>Floyd</b> | gropes around for something, and finds the metal railing of a vinyl
<b>Floyd</b> | bed.  You use it to steady your balance as you pull yourself up.  You
<b>Floyd</b> | close your eyes to help yourself adjust.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  As your vision clears and your nausea subsides you are gifted with a
<b>Floyd</b> | very acute headache.  Feeling less groggy, a sudden realization of a
<b>Floyd</b> | deep, debilitating hunger nearly doubles you over in pain.  You can't
<b>Floyd</b> | remember how on earth this happened to you, but then retrograde
<b>Floyd</b> | amnesia is rather common in head trauma victims.  You take time to
<b>Floyd</b> | recover your senses, then assess the situation.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Radiation Chamber
<b>Floyd</b> | You instantly recognize the special room of the hospital you are in;
<b>Floyd</b> | after all you've been working here for years.  You can see the
<b>Floyd</b> | delicate instruments of radiation treatment neatly positioned, ready
<b>Floyd</b> | to use. There is a worn green vinyl bed underneath the delicate
<b>Floyd</b> | machinery.  A quick glance around also finds you a smashed glass
<b>Floyd</b> | paperweight on the ground, which you suspect is the cause of your
<b>Floyd</b> | massive headache.  Your hunger is probably just from being knocked out
<b>Floyd</b> | for so long.  You also notice an airtight, electronic sealed door with
<b>Floyd</b> | a large button next to it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can go south to the Control Room.

<b>Floyd</b> | In this hospital, that color is reserved for emergency cases -

<b>Floyd</b> | original zombie victim's files.  First flipping casually through the
<b>Floyd</b> | files, you notice that there are several copies of the same documents.
<b>Floyd</b> | Several people were going over these files.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The files talk about a John Doe victim who was bitten in the leg,
<b>Floyd</b> | punctured a major vessel, lost consciousness, and whose heart had
<b>Floyd</b> | stopped for 2 minutes.  The heart resumed function, and then the man
<b>Floyd</b> | jumped out of his stretcher and attacked several doctors with his
<b>Floyd</b> | teeth.  He had to be restrained, but not after biting several
<b>Floyd</b> | orderlies and other staff.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Whenever he noticed anyone in the vicinity, he would mindlessly and

<b>Floyd</b> | is a note about his disease definitely being transmitted by bite - you
<b>Floyd</b> | guess this means the staff turned as well, but you suppose their
<b>Floyd</b> | records would be kept confidentially separate from this John Doe.  You

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This isn't really anything that you wouldn't have guessed yourself,
<b>Floyd</b> | except for a little addendum at the end: There are notes that several
<b>Floyd</b> | of the cancer patients did not get infected, even after they got
<b>Floyd</b> | bitten.  This knowledge will certainly come in handy fighting this

<b>Floyd</b> | You climb through the barricade and survey the room.  The room is
<b>Floyd</b> | softly lit by the lights from a huge heating furnace with plenty of

<b>Floyd</b> | woke up chained, and heard him cursing at the barricade.".
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You hear shouts coming from the other side of the barricade, warning

<b>Floyd</b> | "because I look like a victim."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You glance at his wrists, and the tale they immediately tell.  The

<b>Floyd</b> | Suddenly, the top file cabinet is wrenched back and a S.W.A.T. member
<b>Floyd</b> | runs through the top pile of doors.  After only glancing at the pile
<b>Floyd</b> | of bodies, he swings his rifle up at you.  "What the hell is going

<b>Floyd</b> | widen and your nostrils flare.  You automatically switch to a
<b>Floyd</b> | combative stance and an image of pouncing him and disarming him of
<b>Floyd</b> | that rifle briefly flashes through your mind.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Luckily, your companion has better kept his wits about him, and he
<b>Floyd</b> | immediately intervenes: stepping into the line of fire and telling how

<b>Floyd</b> | After complying with their orders, the members of the S.W.A.T. remain

<b>Floyd</b> | walks up to you.  "Do you know... who... what you are?" Confused, all
<b>Floyd</b> | you can do is shake your head.  One of the other members starts
<b>Floyd</b> | digging through a pack and procures a tactical mirror, handing it
<b>Floyd</b> | over.  Hesitantly, you look at yourself in the mirror.  Your skin is
<b>Floyd</b> | mottled and was decomposing at some point, but now has a weathered,
<b>Floyd</b> | preserved look.  There is a rather large gash on your forehead that
<b>Floyd</b> | has been bandaged.  Helplessly you stare at the reflection you want
<b>Floyd</b> | not to be your own, but that matches you at every turn.  You drop the
<b>Floyd</b> | mirror and start to cry.  No tears come; you are physically incapable.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  The young man whom you saved sees your distress, comes over and
<b>Floyd</b> | embraces you, not caring that his skin touches yours.  The guns are
<b>Floyd</b> | all lowered and you hear a cacophony of clicks.  Radiation kills the
<b>Floyd</b> | neuro-virus, and you realize the significance of you waking up in a
<b>Floyd</b> | radiation chamber.  Noticing that you are lost in your thoughts, you
<b>Floyd</b> | glance around at a room of confused S.W.A.T members.  Taking advantage
<b>Floyd</b> | of the uncertainty, you dramatically rise up, "I am an infected who
<b>Floyd</b> | has been to madness and back and I can save them all."   A bit
<b>Floyd</b> | cheesier than you had intended, but it gets the job done.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  You guide the hesitant doctors and scientist through the hospital's
<b>Floyd</b> | notes.  Thanks to you, the infection policy is changed after a week.
<b>Floyd</b> | While people's sanities are restored, their skin maintains the same
<b>Floyd</b> | pale, mottled and rotting look.  The legal status of the new undead
<b>Floyd</b> | becomes annoyingly uncertain as intolerance finds its newest schism.
<b>Floyd</b> | You become a poster child for zombie tolerance, equality and reason,
<b>Floyd</b> | starting a new non-profit organization designed to fight legal
<b>Floyd</b> | discrimination.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Your wound never heals and your hair never grows out, and to the
<b>Floyd</b> | chagrin of the vegetarian inside you, all you can eat is meat.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | young man you rescued, Mark Cayman, remains a true friend and ally in
<b>Floyd</b> | the fight for zombie equality.  A few days ago, he asked you to a
