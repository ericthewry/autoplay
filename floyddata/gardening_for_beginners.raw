The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of three games written for the <i>Spring Speed IF</i>, written by Juhana&nbsp;Leinonen, Roger&nbsp;Carbol, and Michael&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Martin, respectively.</br></br>These games were written based on the following premise:  <i>Ah, spring. Flowers blossom, allergies resurface. The world awakes, and so does Speed IF. Club Floyd, consuming games insatiably, is looking for some games. Your games should be short and enjoyable (of course), and spring themed in any way you could think of. Incorporation of resurrection would be nice (though don't tell Marvin.)</i></br></br>You can learn more about these games, including how to download them, by visiting <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Spring_Speed-IF_2008"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.

</br></br>Once the group was done with the Spring Speed IF games, they had some more time to kill, and decided to also tackle <I>Cheater</I> by Wesley Osam.  <I>Cheater</I> was originally released in 1996.  You can learn more about <I>Cheater</I>, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/42"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |     It is the year 2753.  You are engaged in a contest, a race across
<b>Floyd</b> | the galaxy to acquire the Toaster of Battle Creek Michigan (the last
<b>Floyd</b> | functioning toaster in the known universe, and therefore extremely
<b>Floyd</b> | valuable.)
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |     You like to win.  To ensure your success in this competition, you
<b>Floyd</b> | sabotaged the starships of the other participants.  Now you alone (or
<b>Floyd</b> | at least you and your faithful assistant Walter) have discovered the
<b>Floyd</b> | cavern of the Toaster.  Gloatingly, you ordered Walter to lower you
<b>Floyd</b> | into the cave...
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |     But your rope snapped, and now you're trapped here - perhaps
<b>Floyd</b> | forever...

<b>Floyd</b> | odd paragraph stating my eternal gratitude for the debugging verbs?
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm not actually that anal retentive; it was a hint.  If you look at
<b>Floyd</b> | the version listing, you'll notice the "D" that denotes that those
<b>Floyd</b> | debugging verbs are active.  Experiment with the ones I listed to find
<b>Floyd</b> | out what they do.  Once you've done that, the rest is simple.

<b>Floyd</b> | didn't like that one, you should flee screaming into the night now.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | [9]Inform has turned out to be a really great language, now that I've

<b>Floyd</b> | figured out how to make it work on the Macintosh.  I'm especially
<b>Floyd</b> | grateful for the debugging verbs (such as gonear and purloin), and the
<b>Floyd</b> | neat way that the program reminds you they're on with the "D" in the
