</TD><td></td><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | The Fox, The Dragon, and The Stale Loaf of Bread got its initial
<b>Floyd</b> | inspiration from Emily Short's game Savoir-Faire. Yes, I know. This
<b>Floyd</b> | game is nothing like that one. Let me explain.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | What happened was that Emily and I had a brief little discussion on
<b>Floyd</b> | the ifMud about how objects were coded in her game. Apparently some
<b>Floyd</b> | game-objects represented multiple objects within the game, and I
<b>Floyd</b> | interpreted this to mean that some objects were like extras in a
<b>Floyd</b> | theatre play. So, perhaps in the Living Room, Joe Extra played the
<b>Floyd</b> | role of the fox on the wallpaper, but in the Bedroom, Joe Extra played

<b>Floyd</b> | the role of the dragon carving.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Well, I was wrong about that. That wasn't how Emily did it at all. But
<b>Floyd</b> | I still liked the idea of the fox, the dragon, and yes, the stale loaf
<b>Floyd</b> | of bread being actors, and then I started thinking of them as NPCs and
<b>Floyd</b> | PCs, and, well, I like fairy tales, and thus was born the idea of this

<b>Floyd</b> | unlikely trio helping some other guy on his quest. That guy being you.
<b>Floyd</b> | You help them out, and then they'd be obligated to help you out.
<b>Floyd</b> | Simple enough.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Simple, except for one of the trio being a stale loaf of bread. That's
<b>Floyd</b> | really weird y'know? What motivates a loaf of bread? What can it

<b>Floyd</b> | possibly do to help? That's going to be a fun question to answer.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | By the way, I must apologize for the complete lack of testing in this
<b>Floyd</b> | game. I foolishly left things until the very last minute, and I know
<b>Floyd</b> | that the game is not as robust or as bulletproof as I'd like.
<b>Floyd</b> | Hopefully, the Spirit of IntroComp will bless this mess, understanding

<b>Floyd</b> | that the beginning of a game is going to lack a little completeness in
<b>Floyd</b> | any case.

<b>Floyd</b> | Mountain Trail

<b>Floyd</b> | You are on a lonely mountain trail. Trees grow sparsely this high up

<b>Floyd</b> | To the west, the trail heads down past the treeline into a forest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And not a moment too soon. You are positively famished.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Day after endless day, stuck in this hideous palace.  Its very

<b>Floyd</b> | greenness mocks you: There are no trees here that you can cut down.
<b>Floyd</b> | Every day you spend an hour or two whacking on the big log they put in
<b>Floyd</b> | your suite, but it's just not the same.  For companions you have only
<b>Floyd</b> | an endless stream of anonymous, fawning courtiers, that dunce of a
<b>Floyd</b> | Scarecrow, the pathetically neurotic Lion, and - every time you turn
<b>Floyd</b> | around, it seems - the ill-mannered, ill-tempered brat and her

<b>Floyd</b> | yapping, incontinent dog.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The brat - give her her proper name, Dorothy - is the worst of the
<b>Floyd</b> | lot.  Some way has got to be found to send her back to Kansas.  And
<b>Floyd</b> | quickly!
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The Wizard is useless, of course.  Hides himself away in his chamber
<b>Floyd</b> | and throws open the doors only when he's ready to show off some new
<b>Floyd</b> | bit of stage magic even more pathetic than the last bit.  After which
<b>Floyd</b> | everyone tells him how wonderful and magnificent he is, kiss, kiss.
<b>Floyd</b> | No, you'll have to manage it somehow with or without his aid.  To make
<b>Floyd</b> | matters worse, you have no idea where Kansas is, or how one might get

<b>Floyd</b> | there from here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nor is Dorothy being cooperative.  She doesn't want to go back to
<b>Floyd</b> | Kansas, that's abundantly clear.  Oh, once in a while she delivers a
<b>Floyd</b> | pious, tearful speech about how terribly she misses her Aunt Em.  But
<b>Floyd</b> | most of the time she's all too happy jumping out from behind the

<b>Floyd</b> | furniture and shouting "Boo!" to torment the poor Lion, or flicking
<b>Floyd</b> | lighted matches at the Scarecrow, or gorging herself on endless mounds
<b>Floyd</b> | of caramels.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But this time she's truly gone too far: She's stolen your oilcan.

<b>Floyd</b> | Your Private Suite

<b>Floyd</b> | holding) to the wicker basket at her feet.  Her little brows wrinkle
<b>Floyd</b> | up, and you're afraid she's about to go into the gallons-of-tears
<b>Floyd</b> | routine.  But then she says, sniffling, "If I give you the oilcan,
<b>Floyd</b> | will you give me back my nice caramels?"
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Since that was the whole point of cutting the rope and grabbing the
<b>Floyd</b> | caramels (what other earthly use would you have for the sticky
<b>Floyd</b> | things?), you say with dignity, "We can trade, if you like."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Without further ado, Dorothy reaches down into the big wicker basket
<b>Floyd</b> | at her feet, gropes under the green cushion, extracts the oilcan, and

<b>Floyd</b> | holds it out to you by the spout in a stiff fist.  It requires an
<b>Floyd</b> | effort not to lunge at it and grab it, but you don't want to give her
<b>Floyd</b> | the satisfaction.  You unwrap her fingers from around the spout quite
<b>Floyd</b> | gently, take the can, and give her the tray of caramels.  She promptly
<b>Floyd</b> | stuffs half a dozen of them into her mouth and chews with great
<b>Floyd</b> | determination, glaring at you the while.  You've spoiled her fun.

<b>Floyd</b> | ACA Living Quarters

<b>Floyd</b> | This is the central hub of the living quarters for section ACA.  Alpha
<b>Floyd</b> | quarters are to the west, Beta quarters are to the southwest and Gamma
<b>Floyd</b> | quarters are to the south.  The corridor leading to Gamma quarters has
<b>Floyd</b> | been sealed by a door.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The door access panel contains a Gamma Quarters manual access bolt.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A sharp edge on the hole slices through the hose of your oxygen tanks,

<b>Floyd</b> | Outside Station
<b>Floyd</b> | You are clinging to the outside of Folkar Station just outside Gamma
