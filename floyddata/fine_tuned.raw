The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Fine Tuned</i>, written by Dionysius&nbsp;Porcupine, a <I>nom de plume</I> for Dennis Jerz.  <i>Fine Tuned</i> was originally released as part of the 2001 IF Competition, where it took eighteenth place.  It was also nominated in that year for two Xyzzy Awards: one for Best Individual PC, and one for Best Setting.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/1669"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.</br>

</BR>Many thanks to David Welbourn for sitting in for me and saving a transcript on this particular day, as I was away on a business trip.  Thanks, David!</br>

<b>Floyd</b> | Help -- Commands
<b>Floyd</b> | "Fine-Tuned" is interactive fiction -- a story that unfolds in
<b>Floyd</b> | response to instructions that you give to the main character. Tell the
<b>Floyd</b> | computer (by typing a short command) what you would do if you were the

<b>Floyd</b> | protagonist. In general, try to take everything and try to examine
<b>Floyd</b> | everything.
<b>Floyd</b> |      &gt;enter dynamo
<b>Floyd</b> |      &gt;search dashboard
<b>Floyd</b> |      &gt;fill bucket

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Since you know thousands of words, and this game only understands a
<b>Floyd</b> | few hundred, you'll have to give very simple orders. Among the more
<b>Floyd</b> | useful commands:
<b>Floyd</b> |      &gt;look (a good way to get your bearings and ideas for what to do
<b>Floyd</b> | next)

<b>Floyd</b> |      &gt;examine [thing] (describe that thing)
<b>Floyd</b> |      &gt;i (inventory; displays what you're carrying)
<b>Floyd</b> |      &gt;go north, go south, etc. (or just the letters 'n', 's', etc.)
<b>Floyd</b> |      &gt;wait (do nothing for one turn)
<b>Floyd</b> |      &gt;help (get a list of help topics)

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You may also try taking, dropping, opening and closing things; putting
<b>Floyd</b> | things on top of or inside other things; switching things on and off,
<b>Floyd</b> | and using all your senses.

<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks for playing Fine-Tuned. If you're one of those who were

<b>Floyd</b> | frustrated by the original, buggy IF Competition release, thanks for
<b>Floyd</b> | giving it another shot.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you'd like to try the game over again, here are some suggestions:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | CREDITS

<b>Floyd</b> | Type "about" to get a list of acknowledgements, both of beta-testers
<b>Floyd</b> | and sources (movies, books, and history) that inspired this game.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | CHAPTER 1
<b>Floyd</b> | * Aloysius hums a happy tune to himself while working on the Dynamo.
<b>Floyd</b> | What could it that tune be? Ask him about 'humming'.

<b>Floyd</b> | * It's possible to finish the game without getting the highest score.
<b>Floyd</b> | You lose points for performing certain un-dashing, un-heroic actions
<b>Floyd</b> | that would be unbecoming of a goggle-faced scarf-necked glove-handed
<b>Floyd</b> | wheel-hugger like Troy Sterling.
<b>Floyd</b> | * If you take too long getting Miss Sweet into the Dynamo, she will
<b>Floyd</b> | make her own arrangements for getting to the professor's house. The

<b>Floyd</b> | race against the train is less interesting without Miss Sweet, but the
<b>Floyd</b> | story progresses the same either way.
<b>Floyd</b> | * Did you find the treehouse?
<b>Floyd</b> | * There are animals in the livery stable area, but they don't call
<b>Floyd</b> | attention to themselves.
<b>Floyd</b> | * If you deliberately upset Aloysius in the beginning, he will

<b>Floyd</b> | eventually get mad and leave. This is arguably the best story ending
<b>Floyd</b> | for him.
<b>Floyd</b> | * Aloysius refers to Professor Fate (from "The Great Race") and
<b>Floyd</b> | building flying cars in Vulgaria (from "Chitty-Chitty Bang-Bang").
<b>Floyd</b> | * The Dynamo might be useful for smashing through the professor's
<b>Floyd</b> | front door.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | CHAPTER 2
<b>Floyd</b> | * The professor knows quite a bit about your background. You can talk
<b>Floyd</b> | with him about some of the details you find in the newspaper
<b>Floyd</b> | clippings.
<b>Floyd</b> | * The tapestry in the professor's parlour contains a hint.

<b>Floyd</b> | * The photos in the professor's parlour describe a scene from Graham
<b>Floyd</b> | Nelson's "Ruins" (the sample game in the Inform Designer's Manual).
<b>Floyd</b> | * If melody examines the sun or listens to the birds, the responses
<b>Floyd</b> | refer to the lyrics of her signature song.
<b>Floyd</b> | * You can ask the professor about cheese (one of several cheese
<b>Floyd</b> | references in the game... a shameless ploy to be included on Emily

<b>Floyd</b> | Short's cheese-related list of IF games).
<b>Floyd</b> | * Typing the magic word "XYZZY" (from "Colossal Cave Adventure") calls
<b>Floyd</b> | up a message full of silly interactive fiction in-jokes. The same
<b>Floyd</b> | thing happens when you count the leaves (a reference to "Zork").
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | CHAPTER 3

<b>Floyd</b> | * There are about ten different ways to end chapter 3. Salomonder has
<b>Floyd</b> | puns for most of these occasions. (The one involving the tree in the
<b>Floyd</b> | backyard is probably the best.)
<b>Floyd</b> | * There's a way to gain access to the objects in the professor's
<b>Floyd</b> | trophy case. (Troy can do it in this chapter, or Melody can do it in
<b>Floyd</b> | Chapter 4.)

<b>Floyd</b> | * The emerald is from "Colossal Cave Adventure".
<b>Floyd</b> | * The sordid elf of Great-Aunt Ickwiddy is a pun on an important prop
<b>Floyd</b> | in "Zork".

</TD><td></td><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | * The statuette is another reference to "Ruins."

<b>Floyd</b> | * The porcelain art object is a horror, isn't it? Break it if you get
<b>Floyd</b> | the chance.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | CHAPTER 4
<b>Floyd</b> | * The apple tree that magically appears near the Dynamo was there all
<b>Floyd</b> | along... Troy just didn't notice it in the previous chapter.

<b>Floyd</b> | * Aloysius and Troy will respond differently if Melody offers an apple
<b>Floyd</b> | to them.
<b>Floyd</b> | * For the first several releases of the game, Melody calms the horse
<b>Floyd</b> | by giving it a sugar cube from the tea set in the professor's study.
<b>Floyd</b> | But I wanted to ensure that Melody had interacted at least slightly
<b>Floyd</b> | with Aloysius before she helped Troy get the wheel... as the scenes

<b>Floyd</b> | between Melody and Aloysius developed, I realized that Troy couldn't
<b>Floyd</b> | be there watching.
<b>Floyd</b> | * The song MacDougal sings, "Get Out and Get Under," is a popular
<b>Floyd</b> | barroom tune dating from 1913. I liked it so much that, while I had
<b>Floyd</b> | envisioned the story set around 1910, I included it anyway. It's in
<b>Floyd</b> | the common domain by now. I found the lyrics and an MP3 on the

<b>Floyd</b> | Internet. (See &lt;www.uwec.edu/jerzdg&gt; for more info.)
<b>Floyd</b> | * While Olympia's aria is definitely in the common domain by now, I
<b>Floyd</b> | wasn't able to find a recording that was also in the common domain.
