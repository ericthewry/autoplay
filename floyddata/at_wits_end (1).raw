The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of two games.</br></br>

The first game, <I>The Fire Tower</I>, is by Jacqueline A. Lott.  It was originally released as part of the 2004 IF Art Show, where it took Best of Show, and it also received a Xyzzy for Best Setting.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/2689"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>, and you can skip directly to the section of the transcript that includes <I>The Fire Tower</I> by clicking <A HREF="#ft"><U>here</U></A>.</br></br>

The second game, <I>At Wit's End</I>, is by Mike Sousa.  It was originally released as part of the 2000 IF Competition, where it took seventeenth place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/1010"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>, and you can skip directly to the section of the transcript that includes <I>At Wit's End</I> by clicking <A HREF="#awe"><U>here</U></A>.</br></br>

</BR>Many thanks to David Welbourn for sitting in for me and to both him and Jayson Smith for saving a transcript on this particular day, as I was away on a business trip.  Thanks, you two!</br>

<b>Floyd</b> | "You're certain that you'll be okay on your own?" he asks.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You smile at him, tightening the pack around your waist. A slight
<b>Floyd</b> | laugh creeps into your voice - it's not as if you haven't done this
<b>Floyd</b> | before. "Yes, dear. I'll be fine. It's nothing personal, I just..."
<b>Floyd</b> | You take in the concerned expression on his face and your voice
<b>Floyd</b> | softens slightly. "I just need a break. Not from you, necessarily, but

<b>Floyd</b> | from everything: work, responsibilities, friends. I just need a day to
<b>Floyd</b> | myself, you know?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He nods. "Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do. No worries; I get like that myself
<b>Floyd</b> | sometimes. Just in case something happens, what route do you plan to
<b>Floyd</b> | take? Your usual?"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You nod. "Yeah. I'll head up the long way, on the Lower Mt. Cammerer
<b>Floyd</b> | trail, hit the Appalachian trail to get to the tower, then descend by
<b>Floyd</b> | going further down the AT towards Low Gap. I'll take the Low Gap trail
<b>Floyd</b> | back to the campground."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | He smiles at you. "Like I said, 'Your usual.'  Listen, I'll be back to
<b>Floyd</b> | pick you up about... Hm, what time?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, if I were just hiking, I could be out by mid-afternoon, but I
<b>Floyd</b> | really want to take my time and enjoy things. I guess it gets dark
<b>Floyd</b> | about... what? Half past nine these days?" He nods. "I should be out

<b>Floyd</b> | by then. I'll meet you right back here at nine-thirty, okay?" you
<b>Floyd</b> | offer up your most reassuring smile.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Sure," he says. "I love you. Be careful, and have a great hike."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With that, he kisses you lightly on the lips and gets back in the car.

<b>Floyd</b> | He waves out the driver's side window and heads off toward the north

<b>Floyd</b> | Hiker Parking

<b>Floyd</b> | Standing alone at the edge of the deserted parking lot, you take in a
<b>Floyd</b> | deep breath of fresh air and glance about. An inviting trail beckons
<b>Floyd</b> | from the forest to the east; that path quickly curves among the
<b>Floyd</b> | hemlocks and out of sight. Two roads depart from the parking lot: one
<b>Floyd</b> | leads north, towards home, the other south, toward the campground not
<b>Floyd</b> | quite half a mile distant.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Today's hike is one you've done many times before, and you're
<b>Floyd</b> | intimately familiar with the ground you'll cover. You know without the
<b>Floyd</b> | aid of a map that you can proceed either east or south, and that
<b>Floyd</b> | either route will bring you toward the Lower Mt. Cammerer trail. From
<b>Floyd</b> | there it's a slow and steady climb to the fire tower.

<b>Floyd</b> | Your legs, feminine but muscular, are revealed to the world because

<b>Floyd</b> | something to complain about tomorrow, but only to the people who won't
<b>Floyd</b> | say, "Why didn't you wear pants?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At any rate, a long sleeved t-shirt rounds out the ensemble. You're

<b>Floyd</b> | Hiker Parking
<b>Floyd</b> | The hiker parking area is where people generally leave their cars
<b>Floyd</b> | while exploring the nearby trail system in the national park, but this
<b>Floyd</b> | morning it's devoid of vehicles. A grassy hill, recently mown, lines
<b>Floyd</b> | the western edge of the parking lot, while a forest abuts it to the
<b>Floyd</b> | east. From the parking lot there are two roads: one departing north,

<b>Floyd</b> | toward the park exit, and one leading south toward the campground just
<b>Floyd</b> | under half a mile away. A trail enters the woods to the east, quickly
<b>Floyd</b> | disappearing amongst the hemlocks.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For your hike, you can proceed either east or south. Either route will
<b>Floyd</b> | take you to the Lower Mt. Cammerer trail.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You decide it's best to leave the pavement as quickly as possible, and

<b>Floyd</b> | Trail Junction (Lower Mt. Cammerer & Access trails)
<b>Floyd</b> | You're standing at the junction of two trails, and two signs are
<b>Floyd</b> | nailed to a single post here to orient you. The Lower Mt. Cammerer
<b>Floyd</b> | trail heads northeast, toward the Sutton Ridge Overlook and,
<b>Floyd</b> | eventually, to the Appalachian Trail. Alternately, the trail continues
<b>Floyd</b> | southwest toward the campground, about two tenths of a mile away. A

<b>Floyd</b> | second trail, unnamed, runs northwest, toward the parking area where
<b>Floyd</b> | you began, or southeast, toward the Low Gap Trail.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A patch of yellow flowers is growing at the base of the signpost.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | You recommence climbing the Appalachian Trail. Just as with the

<b>Floyd</b> | previous stretch, it's littered with roots and rocks and excessive
<b>Floyd</b> | steepness, and makes you not such a happy hiker. "Oh well," you think
<b>Floyd</b> | to yourself, "it's making me stronger. Stronger. Yes. Stronger."  You
<b>Floyd</b> | continue this rather ineffective little pep talk for about a half a
<b>Floyd</b> | mile, at which point the trail graciously levels out along the crest
<b>Floyd</b> | of a ridge.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You find an easy, confident pace, and begin to notice how effortlessly
<b>Floyd</b> | your legs move on this type of terrain. The lack of obstructions in
<b>Floyd</b> | the trail allows you to take in the view as you hike, and incredible
<b>Floyd</b> | mountain vistas are present on both sides of the trail for a short
<b>Floyd</b> | while - successive waves of blue, smoky ridges trailing off into the

<b>Floyd</b> | distance.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After a bit, the trail begins to descend off the ridge and into the
<b>Floyd</b> | trees... gradually at first, then steeper, and your pace finds a
<b>Floyd</b> | decrescendo as you carefully navigate the slope. Many people prefer a
<b>Floyd</b> | strenuous uphill to this, because descending can be fairly hard on

<b>Floyd</b> | your knees and ankles, but after the beating your lungs and legs took
<b>Floyd</b> | on the AT earlier, you are inclined to respectfully disagree.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After a total walk of just over two miles, you encounter another trail
<b>Floyd</b> | junction.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Trail Junction (Appalachian and Low Gap trails)
<b>Floyd</b> | Two trails cross here, in the center of what's called Low Gap, so
<b>Floyd</b> | named because it's the lowest pass through the mountains for over
<b>Floyd</b> | fifty miles if you were traveling along the Appalachian Trail headed
<b>Floyd</b> | north. The AT runs from northeast to southwest here, climbing toward
<b>Floyd</b> | Cosby Knob and beyond - all the way to Georgia. The Low Gap trail

<b>Floyd</b> | crosses perpendicular to the AT, descending in both directions:
<b>Floyd</b> | southeast, toward Walnut Bottoms and Big Creek, or northwest, toward
<b>Floyd</b> | the Cosby Campground and, for you, home.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A sign at one side of the junction points the way and provides the
<b>Floyd</b> | mileage to nearby landmarks.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your socks have shifted uncomfortably in your boots, so you take a
<b>Floyd</b> | seat in the clearing to readjust them. Once you're finished, you
<b>Floyd</b> | decide the ground feels good enough to simply rest there for a bit.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A cool breeze builds momentarily from the east, cooling your skin.

<b>Floyd</b> | You take in the concerned expression on his face and your voice

<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, if I were just hiking, I could be out by mid-afternoon, but I

<b>Floyd</b> | offer up your most reassuring smile.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Sure," he says. "I love you. Be careful, and have a great hike."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With that, he kisses you lightly on the lips and gets back in the car.
<b>Floyd</b> | He waves out the driver's side window and heads off toward the north

<b>Floyd</b> | Hiker Parking
<b>Floyd</b> | Standing alone at the edge of the deserted parking lot, you take in a
<b>Floyd</b> | deep breath of fresh air and glance about. An inviting trail beckons

<b>Floyd</b> | from the forest to the east; that path quickly curves among the
<b>Floyd</b> | hemlocks and out of sight. Two roads depart from the parking lot: one
<b>Floyd</b> | leads north, towards home, the other south, toward the campground not
<b>Floyd</b> | quite half a mile distant.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Today's hike is one you've done many times before, and you're

<b>Floyd</b> | intimately familiar with the ground you'll cover. You know without the
<b>Floyd</b> | aid of a map that you can proceed either east or south, and that
<b>Floyd</b> | either route will bring you toward the Lower Mt. Cammerer trail. From
<b>Floyd</b> | there it's a slow and steady climb to the fire tower.

<b>Floyd</b> | the trail. As with all of the National Park Service's trail signs, it

<b>Floyd</b> | gives you the name of the trail and the distance to the nearest
<b>Floyd</b> | important junctions. This one reads:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | LOWER MOUNT CAMMERER TRAIL
<b>Floyd</b> | Low Gap Trail 0.2
<b>Floyd</b> | Sutton Ridge Overlook 1.4

<b>Floyd</b> | Appalachian Trail 7.5
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Trail Junction (Lower Mt. Cammerer & Access trails)
<b>Floyd</b> | You're standing at the junction of two trails, and two signs are
<b>Floyd</b> | nailed to a single post here to orient you. The Lower Mt. Cammerer
<b>Floyd</b> | trail heads northeast, toward the Sutton Ridge Overlook and,

<b>Floyd</b> | eventually, to the Appalachian Trail. Alternately, the trail continues
<b>Floyd</b> | southwest toward the campground, about two tenths of a mile away. A

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Spur Trail to Sutton Ridge
<b>Floyd</b> | The trail crests the first of many ridges along the northern side of
<b>Floyd</b> | Mt. Cammerer here. Sutton Ridge, as it's called, is dry and exposed -

<b>Floyd</b> | perhaps not the loveliest spot for a rest break. But from here, a tiny
<b>Floyd</b> | spur trial scrambles up the ridge to the southeast, and the clearing
<b>Floyd</b> | at the top generally provides an lovely view of the surrounding
<b>Floyd</b> | mountains.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You pause to contemplate whether you'd like to check out the spur

<b>Floyd</b> | trail, or to simply continue east, toward the fire tower.

<b>Floyd</b> | Sutton Ridge Overlook
<b>Floyd</b> | The Sutton Ridge Overlook is a very formal name for a very informal
<b>Floyd</b> | clearing on the side of a hill. The ground here remains bare from

<b>Floyd</b> | people such as yourself coming up here to take in the view; evenings
<b>Floyd</b> | in particular are a great time to visit, because this is a wonderful
<b>Floyd</b> | vantage point from which to take in the sunset over Gabes Mountain,
<b>Floyd</b> | across the valley to the west. Though perhaps not quite so stunning as
<b>Floyd</b> | at sunset, the clearing is still quite beautiful during the day. To
<b>Floyd</b> | the north, the Cosby Valley stretches out lush and green, and mountain

<b>Floyd</b> | laurel dots the surrounding hillsides, pink and in full bloom. Galax
<b>Floyd</b> | and arbutus line the edges of the clearing at ground level.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You sit down on the ground in the clearing to catch your breath and
<b>Floyd</b> | take in the view.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Riding Fork Creek

<b>Floyd</b> | Whereas Sutton Ridge was a high spot, dry and exposed, this is a tiny
<b>Floyd</b> | creek draw between two ridges. Riding Fork Creek cascades down a
<b>Floyd</b> | series of mossy dark gray rocks here, southeast of the trail. You can

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | After a pleasant break, you continue on toward the tower. The gradual

<b>Floyd</b> | today's hike.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Trail Junction (Lower Mt Cammerer and Appalachian trails)

<b>Floyd</b> | The Lower Mt. Cammerer trail ends here at a junction with the famous
<b>Floyd</b> | Appalachian Trail. Commonly referred to simply as the "AT," the trail
<b>Floyd</b> | covers nearly the entire length of the Appalachian Mountains, from
<b>Floyd</b> | Maine to Georgia - a distance of over two thousand miles. You wish
<b>Floyd</b> | that you'd taken a summer off during college to hike the length of it,
<b>Floyd</b> | but there's no point in regretting that now. There's always retirement

<b>Floyd</b> | to look forward to, right? You sigh wistfully at the thought and plop
<b>Floyd</b> | down onto the ground among the roots of a large tulip poplar growing
<b>Floyd</b> | in the center of the junction.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The AT runs east-west here. According to the sign, it's only another

<b>Floyd</b> | previous stretch, it's littered with roots and rocks and excessive
<b>Floyd</b> | steepness, and makes you not such a happy hiker. "Oh well," you think
<b>Floyd</b> | to yourself, "it's making me stronger. Stronger. Yes. Stronger."  You
<b>Floyd</b> | continue this rather ineffective little pep talk for about a half a
<b>Floyd</b> | mile, at which point the trail graciously levels out along the crest

<b>Floyd</b> | of a ridge.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You find an easy, confident pace, and begin to notice how effortlessly
<b>Floyd</b> | your legs move on this type of terrain. The lack of obstructions in
<b>Floyd</b> | the trail allows you to take in the view as you hike, and incredible
<b>Floyd</b> | mountain vistas are present on both sides of the trail for a short

<b>Floyd</b> | while - successive waves of blue, smoky ridges trailing off into the
<b>Floyd</b> | distance.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After a bit, the trail begins to descend off the ridge and into the
<b>Floyd</b> | trees... gradually at first, then steeper, and your pace finds a
<b>Floyd</b> | decrescendo as you carefully navigate the slope. Many people prefer a

<b>Floyd</b> | strenuous uphill to this, because descending can be fairly hard on
<b>Floyd</b> | your knees and ankles, but after the beating your lungs and legs took
<b>Floyd</b> | on the AT earlier, you are inclined to respectfully disagree.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After a total walk of just over two miles, you encounter another trail
<b>Floyd</b> | junction.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Trail Junction (Appalachian and Low Gap trails)
<b>Floyd</b> | Two trails cross here, in the center of what's called Low Gap, so
<b>Floyd</b> | named because it's the lowest pass through the mountains for over
<b>Floyd</b> | fifty miles if you were traveling along the Appalachian Trail headed
<b>Floyd</b> | north. The AT runs from northeast to southwest here, climbing toward

<b>Floyd</b> | Cosby Knob and beyond - all the way to Georgia. The Low Gap trail
<b>Floyd</b> | crosses perpendicular to the AT, descending in both directions:
<b>Floyd</b> | southeast, toward Walnut Bottoms and Big Creek, or northwest, toward
<b>Floyd</b> | the Cosby Campground and, for you, home.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A sign at one side of the junction points the way and provides the

<b>Floyd</b> | mileage to nearby landmarks.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your socks have shifted uncomfortably in your boots, so you take a
<b>Floyd</b> | seat in the clearing to readjust them. Once you're finished, you
<b>Floyd</b> | decide the ground feels good enough to simply rest there for a bit.

<b>Floyd</b> | downhill stretch, you set off toward the campground. At first, the
<b>Floyd</b> | going is rather steep, but the trail soon begins to switchback upon
<b>Floyd</b> | itself, snaking slowly downhill toward flatter ground. Though the
<b>Floyd</b> | tight switchbacks reduce the angle of descent, they also make the
<b>Floyd</b> | trail longer and limit the space for trees. There seems to be little
<b>Floyd</b> | or no shade, and the sun beats down relentlessly upon you as you

<b>Floyd</b> | descend the west-facing ridge. It's tempting to simply cut off-trail
<b>Floyd</b> | and travel crosscountry to save time, but you realize that if everyone
<b>Floyd</b> | did that the erosion along this ridge would be terrible.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After about two miles, the switchbacks disappear and you find yourself
<b>Floyd</b> | comforted by the shade of the woods once again. The air is cool here,

<b>Floyd</b> | chilled further by the presence of Cosby Creek, which flows parallel
<b>Floyd</b> | to the path for a quarter mile or so. Larger than the other streams
<b>Floyd</b> | you've encountered today, Cosby Creek is full of white-foamed cascades
<b>Floyd</b> | and deep, dark pools. The water of the stream feeds life into the
<b>Floyd</b> | forest, and everything along this stretch is green and moist and
<b>Floyd</b> | mossy. From time to time the landscape seems rather surreal, as if

<b>Floyd</b> | you're strolling through a fairytale rather than a real place. After a
<b>Floyd</b> | time, the stream flows off into the forest, out of sight, and you're
<b>Floyd</b> | somewhat sad to see it go. No matter, this means you're even closer to
<b>Floyd</b> | home.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The trail begins to widen, from a path to a road, and you come to

<b>Floyd</b> | another junction.

<b>Floyd</b> | corner of the clearing:
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The third base coach slaps you on the butt as you pass him and home

<b>Floyd</b> | spine.  Before your brain can process what just happened, you fall to
<b>Floyd</b> | the floor like a sack of potatoes.  Two men jump on top of you and
<b>Floyd</b> | immediately begin to secure your hands and legs with some rope.  As

<b>Floyd</b> | the rope is being tightened you notice one of them pick up the padlock
<b>Floyd</b> | which fell out of your hand.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You momentarily black out from the pain and after a few moments, or at
<b>Floyd</b> | least, it felt like only a few moments, you regain your consciousness.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You're lying on your back in the middle of a stranger's living room,
<b>Floyd</b> | feet bound and hands tied behind your back.  Two men are standing over
<b>Floyd</b> | you, inspecting their catch with their flashlights.

<b>Floyd</b> | Living Room
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm telling you Tommy, it's him!" whispers one of the men.  "Look!
<b>Floyd</b> | He's still wearing his uniform."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Bobby," counters Tommy, sounding very skeptical, "why would Jake
<b>Floyd</b> | Garrett be breaking into this house in the middle of the night when he
<b>Floyd</b> | just hit the game-winning grand slam a few hours ago?"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I can't answer that, Tom," replies Bobby in a soft, almost giddy
<b>Floyd</b> | voice, "all I know is that I'm a huge fan and this IS Jake Garrett."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Bobby and Tommy stare at you, each taking turns scratching their

<b>Floyd</b> | He divulges more of the plan than Tommy would have liked, and you can
<b>Floyd</b> | hear Tommy tell Bobby to end the call.  After a few moments, Bobby

<b>Floyd</b> | "Okay, hotshot.  We'll be back soon with lots of money," quips Bobby,
<b>Floyd</b> | rather amused.  "Make sure you don't go anywhere!"

<b>Floyd</b> | Both Bobby and Tommy laugh as they start to leave the house.  You

<b>Floyd</b> |    You're in what is best described as a family room, though there is
<b>Floyd</b> | no entertainment center to speak of.  The furniture in this room is

<b>Floyd</b> |    You're standing in the middle of the backyard, which judging by the

<b>Floyd</b> | You're standing on a small path that leads from the backyard to the

<b>Floyd</b> | water.  The path is protected by thick brush and trees and just ahead,
<b>Floyd</b> | is a large pole. Leaning up against the pole is a ladder.  To the
<b>Floyd</b> | north, you can see water as well as a small dock and near the dock is a
<b>Floyd</b> | small motor boat.  The barn is southeast of here.
<b>Floyd</b> | You see a can of coke and a beer here.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Dock
<b>Floyd</b> | You're standing on a short wooden dock, near a boat.  The smell of
<b>Floyd</b> | salt air fills your lungs and you are instantly reminded of your
<b>Floyd</b> | younger days, when you and your father would go on fishing trips that
<b>Floyd</b> | would last all afternoon.  The boat can be boarded to the east and dry
<b>Floyd</b> | land is due south.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At the Dock, In the Boat
<b>Floyd</b> | You're in a decent size boat, which is currently docked.  You're not
<b>Floyd</b> | very familiar with boats and most of the features of this craft are not
<b>Floyd</b> | recognizable.  There is no sail, so you quickly determine that it must
<b>Floyd</b> | be powered.  You recall the note from Jimmy.  It's powered alright, but

<b>Floyd</b> | it has no gas.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An open hatch, which leads down into the cabin, is here.  Just beyond
<b>Floyd</b> | the hatch is the boat's control panel.  At the rear of the boat is the
<b>Floyd</b> | outside casing of the gas tank.  The opening to the tank is currently
<b>Floyd</b> | secured by a gas cap.

<b>Floyd</b> | At the Dock, In the Boat
<b>Floyd</b> | You're in a decent size boat, which is currently docked.  You're not
<b>Floyd</b> | very familiar with boats and most of the features of this craft are not
<b>Floyd</b> | recognizable.  There is no sail, so you quickly determine that it must

<b>Floyd</b> | be powered.  But then again, that's why you put some gas in the tank.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An open hatch, which leads down into the cabin, is here.  Just beyond
<b>Floyd</b> | the hatch is the boat's control panel.  At the rear of the boat is the
<b>Floyd</b> | outside casing of the gas tank.  The opening to the tank is currently
<b>Floyd</b> | secured by a gas cap.

<b>Floyd</b> | starts to move forward.  After a few moments, the boat glides along at

<b>Floyd</b> | about ten knots.  The boat slowly pulls away from the dock.  You put
<b>Floyd</b> | your hand on the steering wheel and guide the craft away from the
<b>Floyd</b> | shore, toward the open water.  With your other hand you move the
<b>Floyd</b> | throttle to fast; you've spent enough time at Bobby's and Tommy's
<b>Floyd</b> | cabin.  Just as the boat appears to hit its stride, you hear gun shots.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Your instincts take over and you dive to the floor, your possessions
<b>Floyd</b> | scattering on the deck floor.  You roll onto your stomach and cover
<b>Floyd</b> | your head with your hands, desperately trying to take cover from the
<b>Floyd</b> | gun fire.  You lift your head slightly and catch a glimpse of an older
<b>Floyd</b> | man at the edge of the dock, firing away at the boat.  You surmise that
<b>Floyd</b> | it's Jimmy, but can't be sure.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The attack only lasts for a few seconds before the speeding boat is out
<b>Floyd</b> | of reach.  You slowly get to your feet and look around.  You can't
<b>Floyd</b> | believe your eyes.  One of the bullets hit the steering wheel dead
<b>Floyd</b> | center.  There's practically nothing left of it.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The boat continues to speed away from the shore at about 25 knots,
<b>Floyd</b> | that's the good news.  The bad news is that without a steering wheel,
<b>Floyd</b> | who knows where you're headed.

<b>Floyd</b> | You extend your hand and introduce yourself, though you quickly realize

<b>Floyd</b> | You explain to him the incredible thirty-six hour stretch you've just

<b>Floyd</b> | that you're here.  She'll probably bring you something to eat,"

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Joe then sits down in the pilot's chair, straps himself in and starts
<b>Floyd</b> | the engine.  You look down at his flimsy two piece seat belt and
<b>Floyd</b> | chuckle.  You're finally glad that you're the passenger.  A few moments
<b>Floyd</b> | later, the plane starts rolling down the runway.

<b>Floyd</b> | indicators than you could have possibly imagined.  You can't even make
<b>Floyd</b> | out the speed or altitude displays, there are just too many of them.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Joe tells you to hang on, this part can be bumpy at times.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Bumpy?" you question Joe.  "I thought you told me that this was smooth

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Heh heh," he chuckles.  "Just sit back and relax," he replies as the

<b>Floyd</b> | The ground quickly approaches and you brace for impact.  You land
<b>Floyd</b> | harder than expected and do a nifty tuck and roll.  The parachute drags
<b>Floyd</b> | your body for several feet before you come to a full stop.  You can't
<b>Floyd</b> | believe you're alive.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You look around and see nothing but cows; just your luck, you happen to

<b>Floyd</b> | land right in the middle of a cow pasture.  Thankfully, you managed to
<b>Floyd</b> | avoid colliding with one of them.  As you regain your senses, you get
<b>Floyd</b> | to your feet and notice several people running toward you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Several folks help you remove the parachute and comment on the plane
<b>Floyd</b> | landing in the water just outside the farm grounds.  You hang your head

<b>Floyd</b> | in shame; you should have saved Joe.  Now he's dead.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Several minutes later, you are escorted to a paramedic who checks you
<b>Floyd</b> | out.  You refuse to ride in the ambulance and ask for a police escort
<b>Floyd</b> | home instead; you've been away from your wife and kids far too long.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Interestingly enough, the police officer mentions on the ride home that
<b>Floyd</b> | one of kidnappers was mortally wounded during the money exchange and
<b>Floyd</b> | that the other man was apprehended at his beach house later that
<b>Floyd</b> | evening.  You're glad that Bobby and Tommy got their just due.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The reunion with your family is a precious moment.  After swapping

<b>Floyd</b> | hugs, kisses and stories, you manage to catch a few winks.  After all,
<b>Floyd</b> | Game One of The Series is tonight.  You just hope that you don't have
<b>Floyd</b> | to hit the game winning home run again.

<b>Floyd</b> | You were:

<b>Floyd</b> | Anxious after barely fouling off a pitch;
<b>Floyd</b> | Distressed about being in the trainer's room wounded;
<b>Floyd</b> | Tranquil when you realized you had to travel via ambulance;
<b>Floyd</b> | Frightened after the ambulance was involved in an accident;
<b>Floyd</b> | Terrified when you hung upside down on the stretcher;
<b>Floyd</b> | Encouraged after you survived the forest fire;

<b>Floyd</b> | Apprehensive of the house on the beach;
<b>Floyd</b> | Incredulous when you stumbled onto a crime in progress;
<b>Floyd</b> | Pessimistic about getting out of the trunk alive;
<b>Floyd</b> | Overwhelmed by Bobby's and Tommy's plan;
<b>Floyd</b> | Concerned that you only had a few minutes to plan an escape in the
<b>Floyd</b> | bathroom;

<b>Floyd</b> | Optimistic that your Swiss army knife would save the day;
<b>Floyd</b> | Desensitized when you ran out of emotional support;
<b>Floyd</b> | Satisfied when you ate hot pizza;
<b>Floyd</b> | Felicitous after you discovered an escape option;
<b>Floyd</b> | Indignant when you caused the shelf to fall in the cellar;
<b>Floyd</b> | Rejuvenated after you stepped outside for the first time at the

<b>Floyd</b> | cabin;
<b>Floyd</b> | Delighted after you landed safely in the barn;
<b>Floyd</b> | Gratified when you found a way to get gas from the barn;
<b>Floyd</b> | Mendacious when you destroyed the light;
<b>Floyd</b> | Thrilled that you finally started the boat;
<b>Floyd</b> | Flabbergasted at your predicament in the boat;

<b>Floyd</b> | Serene after you survived the storm on the boat;
<b>Floyd</b> | Sanguine upon touching terra firma;
<b>Floyd</b> | Hopeful that Joe would be the savior;
<b>Floyd</b> | Emotional after you spoke to your wife;
<b>Floyd</b> | Satiated after you ate that delicious blueberry muffin;
<b>Floyd</b> | Panicky when you saw Joe slumped over in his chair;

<b>Floyd</b> | Abhorrent for leaving Joe in the plane.

<b>Floyd</b> | The ground quickly approaches and you brace for impact.  You land

<b>Floyd</b> | your body for several feet before you come to a full stop.  You can't
<b>Floyd</b> | believe you're alive.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You look around and see nothing but cows; just your luck, you happen to
<b>Floyd</b> | land right in the middle of a cow pasture.  Thankfully, you managed to
<b>Floyd</b> | avoid colliding with one of them.  As you regain your senses, you get

<b>Floyd</b> | to your feet and notice several people running toward you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Several folks help you remove the parachute and comment on the plane
<b>Floyd</b> | landing in the water just outside the farm grounds.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One of them mentions that the elderly man appears to have had a heart

<b>Floyd</b> | attack during the fall, but that the paramedics are on their way and
<b>Floyd</b> | that he's clinging to life.  You saved him.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Several minutes later, you are escorted to a paramedic who checks you
<b>Floyd</b> | out.  You refuse to ride in the ambulance and ask for a police escort
<b>Floyd</b> | home instead; you've been away from your wife and kids far too long.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Interestingly enough, the police officer mentions on the ride home that
<b>Floyd</b> | one of kidnappers was mortally wounded during the money exchange and
<b>Floyd</b> | that the other man was apprehended at his beach house later that
<b>Floyd</b> | evening.  You're glad that Bobby and Tommy got their just due.

<b>Floyd</b> | The reunion with your family is a precious moment.  After swapping

<b>Floyd</b> | Game One of The Series is tonight.  You just hope that you don't have
<b>Floyd</b> | to hit the game winning home run again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You were:

<b>Floyd</b> | Excited by the opportunity to hit the game-winning home run;
<b>Floyd</b> | Anxious after barely fouling off a pitch;
<b>Floyd</b> | Distressed about being in the trainer's room wounded;
<b>Floyd</b> | Tranquil when you realized you had to travel via ambulance;

<b>Floyd</b> | Concerned that you only had a few minutes to plan an escape in the

<b>Floyd</b> | Optimistic that your Swiss army knife would save the day;
<b>Floyd</b> | Desensitized when you ran out of emotional support;
<b>Floyd</b> | Satisfied when you ate hot pizza;
<b>Floyd</b> | Felicitous after you discovered an escape option;
<b>Floyd</b> | Indignant when you caused the shelf to fall in the cellar;

<b>Floyd</b> | Rejuvenated after you stepped outside for the first time at the
<b>Floyd</b> | cabin;
<b>Floyd</b> | Delighted after you landed safely in the barn;
<b>Floyd</b> | Gratified when you found a way to get gas from the barn;
<b>Floyd</b> | Mendacious when you destroyed the light;
<b>Floyd</b> | Thrilled that you finally started the boat;

<b>Floyd</b> | Flabbergasted at your predicament in the boat;
<b>Floyd</b> | Serene after you survived the storm on the boat;
<b>Floyd</b> | Sanguine upon touching terra firma;
<b>Floyd</b> | Hopeful that Joe would be the savior;
<b>Floyd</b> | Emotional after you spoke to your wife;
<b>Floyd</b> | Satiated after you ate that delicious blueberry muffin;

<b>Floyd</b> | Panicky when you saw Joe slumped over in his chair;
