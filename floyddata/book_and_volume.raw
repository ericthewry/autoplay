The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Book and Volume</i>, written by Nick Montfort.  <I>Book and Volume</I> was independently released in 2005, and was selected for inclusion in the Iowa Web Review, the Medi@terra International Art+Technology Festival: Gaming Realities 2006, and the Slamdance Guerilla Gamemaker Competition 2007 (though it was withdrawn from this last competition by Montfort in protest of Slamdance's exclusion of another finalist).  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Book_and_Volume'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | Book and Volume
<b>Floyd</b> | by Nick Montfort
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 8, 2005-12-25
<b>Floyd</b> | Written in Inform 6.30 with library 6/11
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I greatly appreciate the help I've received from the interactive
<b>Floyd</b> | fiction community (particularly those who have discussed IF with me on
<b>Floyd</b> | ifMUD), the broader electronic literature community, and my literary
<b>Floyd</b> | collaborators. Thanks to all the authors, players, poets, reviewers,
<b>Floyd</b> | and others who have led me to think about writing, computing, and
<b>Floyd</b> | interactive fiction in new ways.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Book and Volume was written in Inform, a language for IF development
<b>Floyd</b> | created by Graham Nelson. It runs on the Z-Machine, a software
<b>Floyd</b> | computer developed by Joel Berez and Marc Blank.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I particularly want to thank the following people, who played
<b>Floyd</b> | pre-release versions of Book and Volume and who offered their thoughts
<b>Floyd</b> | and transcripts:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Ian Bogost
<b>Floyd</b> | Jeremy Douglass
<b>Floyd</b> | Josh Kellar
<b>Floyd</b> | Ryan McDonald
<b>Floyd</b> | Scott Rettberg
<b>Floyd</b> | Dan Shiovitz
<b>Floyd</b> | Emily Short
<b>Floyd</b> | Dirk Stratton
<b>Floyd</b> | Jill Walker
<b>Floyd</b> | Hanna Wallach
<b>Floyd</b> | Noah Wardrip-Fruin
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks to Andrew Suffield, Brian Rapp, Jose Manuel Garcia, Brian Kerr,
<b>Floyd</b> | Jeremy Rogers, and Andrew Plotkin for post-release bug reports.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Also, I'm very grateful that I was given the opportunity to read from
<b>Floyd</b> | pre-release versions of Book and Volume at The Richard Stockton
<b>Floyd</b> | College, at The Kelly Writers House at the University of Pennsylvania,
<b>Floyd</b> | and at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities at the
<b>Floyd</b> | University of Maryland.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, thanks go to these Philadelphia coffeehouses, in which much
<b>Floyd</b> | of Book and Volume was written: Intermezzo, Crimson Moon, Capriccio,
<b>Floyd</b> | and The Last Drop.

<b>Floyd</b> | Upstairs in the house of your childhood, in your room, and it must be

<b>Floyd</b> | You're a grown-up: It opens to you again, a sluggish window summoned

<b>Floyd</b> | fact the weekend, but you're not in elementary school. No one is
<b>Floyd</b> | crawling in through the window. You're a system administrator for

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | ( Interactive fiction provides a world, complete with a setting that
<b>Floyd</b> | is a simulated space, objects and characters that exist within that
<b>Floyd</b> | space, and even unusual physical laws.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This world and the things that happen in it are described to you, the
<b>Floyd</b> | player, in text. You control a character, the "player character," by
<b>Floyd</b> | typing short commands that express what you want the character to do
<b>Floyd</b> | next. Many simple commands that you could give to an actor, standing
<b>Floyd</b> | on stage with the appropriate props around, should be understood.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The "&gt;" prompt is what indicates that it's your turn to type
<b>Floyd</b> | something, for instance:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;OPEN THE CD CASE
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;PURCHASE A WIDGET
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;ASK THE GOON FOR THE TIME
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The first of these is only a sensible command when there is a CD case
<b>Floyd</b> | in the player character's possession or in the area; the second can
<b>Floyd</b> | only be expected to work if the player character has money and is
<b>Floyd</b> | somewhere where widgets are sold; and the last command will only be
<b>Floyd</b> | meaningful if there is a goon nearby or otherwise available for
<b>Floyd</b> | communication.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Headings, shown in bold, indicate the current location of the player
<b>Floyd</b> | character.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The current location is also named in the upper right; the obvious
<b>Floyd</b> | ways to leave are indicated in the upper left. The command EXITS will
<b>Floyd</b> | result in the obvious ways to leave being named explicitly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Upon entering a location, the area will be described. To take a closer
<b>Floyd</b> | look at something in the location or in the player character's
<b>Floyd</b> | possession, you can EXAMINE or LOOK AT it. In Book and Volume, the
<b>Floyd</b> | first description may provide more commentary or reminisces than later
<b>Floyd</b> | descriptions.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can command the player character to manipulate things in the
<b>Floyd</b> | world, too: to pick up certain things, turn some devices on and off,
<b>Floyd</b> | and eat food, for instance. The player character can also be commanded
<b>Floyd</b> | to talk to some other characters.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | SCORE and FULL SCORE provide some information about how you are
<b>Floyd</b> | progressing at some tasks.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | First-time players are sometimes frustrated that certain commands will
<b>Floyd</b> | not work, but there is some sort of system to interactive fiction. The
<b>Floyd</b> | sort of commands that usually don't work include:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | [No...] &gt;DONATE MY ORGANS TO SCIENCE
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Unless the player character has just been presented with a blank organ
<b>Floyd</b> | donor card, there would be no obvious way to do this. Even in that
<b>Floyd</b> | case, something more specific and concrete, such as CHECK THE TOP BOX,
<b>Floyd</b> | might be more effective. Commands should generally have something to
<b>Floyd</b> | do with concrete things in the immediate area, although conversations
<b>Floyd</b> | with other characters might be about abstract topics.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | [No...] &gt;GO TO TANGIERS
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The player character is usually only able to move around locally,
<b>Floyd</b> | following such commands as GO NORTH, LEAVE, and GO TO THE RESTAURANT
<b>Floyd</b> | (when there is a single restaurant in the immediate area). An
<b>Floyd</b> | indicator in the upper left shows what directions the player character
<b>Floyd</b> | can move in. You can also type EXITS to see these directions listed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | More generally, complex actions that involve numerous steps
<b>Floyd</b> | (purchasing a plane ticket, booking a hotel room, packing for a trip,
<b>Floyd</b> | arranging ground transportation to the airport, waiting in line at
<b>Floyd</b> | security, and so on) cannot usually be accomplished with a single
<b>Floyd</b> | command. Some actions of moderate complexity might be possible with
<b>Floyd</b> | single commands, however, if they are routine ones for the player
<b>Floyd</b> | character.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | [No...] &gt;WALK TO THE COFFEE TABLE
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If there's a coffee table in the room, you can just directly command
<b>Floyd</b> | the player character to do several things: look at it, take things off
<b>Floyd</b> | it, put things on it, and so forth. There's usually no need to move
<b>Floyd</b> | the player character around in front of specific pieces of furniture;
<b>Floyd</b> | just specifying what is to be done is enough.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | [No...] &gt;SLYLY SPRYLY RUN
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One problem is that the command does not specify where to run to or
<b>Floyd</b> | what direction to run in. Also, the adverbs will not be understood.
<b>Floyd</b> | Generally, adverbs are unnecessary. You are asked to choose what basic
<b>Floyd</b> | things the player character does, not the very fine details of how
<b>Floyd</b> | those actions are accomplished.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You may want to take some notes as you play interactive fiction.
<b>Floyd</b> | Traditionally, players have drawn a map as they progress through a
<b>Floyd</b> | particular interactive fiction world; this may or may not be necessary
<b>Floyd</b> | for particular people playing particular pieces of interactive
<b>Floyd</b> | fiction.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, playing interactive fiction with others, in person or online,
<b>Floyd</b> | is probably the best introduction. Even if your fellow players are not
<b>Floyd</b> | interactive fiction experts, different people will have different good
<b>Floyd</b> | ideas about how to make progress, and working together can be fun. )
