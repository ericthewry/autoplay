The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Taco Fiction</i>, written by Ryan Veeder.  <I>Taco Fiction</I> was released as part of the 2011 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took first place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Taco_Fiction'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | Outside Paco's Tacos
<b>Floyd</b> | Here's the entrance to Paco's Tacos, everyone's favorite place for a
<b>Floyd</b> | bite as long as everything else is closed. The stretch of sidewalk here
<b>Floyd</b> | is covered by a striped awning for the masses to huddle under while
<b>Floyd</b> | waiting for a table at peak hours. The door to the north is framed by
<b>Floyd</b> | neon signs behind plate glass windows. Further east, there's some sort
<b>Floyd</b> | of ice cream place.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now is a good time to go over the plan before you pull the job. It'd be
<b>Floyd</b> | nice if you had everything written down as a reminder, but a note like
<b>Floyd</b> | that could end up being incriminating. So, mentally, as you're standing
<b>Floyd</b> | here in front of the taco shop, remember:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Once you're inside, you're going to go north across the dining room, to
<b>Floyd</b> | where the counter is. Then you're going to point the gun at the cashier
<b>Floyd</b> | and, without hesitating, tell the cashier to open the cash register.
<b>Floyd</b> | When that's done, tell the cashier to take the money from the register
<b>Floyd</b> | and tell the cashier to give the money to you. (But don't say "to you",
<b>Floyd</b> | say "to me".) Finally, while still pointing the gun at the cashier,
<b>Floyd</b> | walk backward to the entrance. Once you're back outside, you just have
<b>Floyd</b> | to get to your car and drive away.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nobody will get hurt, nobody will recognize you, and best of all,
<b>Floyd</b> | nobody will get evicted.

<b>Floyd</b> | What is it?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's something that's not bad, exactly, but something that you're not

<b>Floyd</b> | before it's gone.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So you start eating a little slower. You close your eyes.

<b>Floyd</b> | Cookie dough! This tastes like cookie dough. It's not vanilla ice cream
<b>Floyd</b> | with pieces of cookie dough in it; it's cookie dough in the shape
<b>Floyd</b> | of--Goodness.

<b>Floyd</b> | Now is a good time to go over the plan before you pull the job. It'd be

<b>Floyd</b> | here in front of the taco shop, remember:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Once you're inside, you're going to go north across the dining room, to
<b>Floyd</b> | where the counter is. Then you're going to point the gun at the cashier
<b>Floyd</b> | and, without hesitating, tell the cashier to open the cash register.
<b>Floyd</b> | When that's done, tell the cashier to take the money from the register
<b>Floyd</b> | and tell the cashier to give the money to you. (But don't say "to you",
<b>Floyd</b> | say "to me".) Finally, while still pointing the gun at the cashier,
<b>Floyd</b> | walk backward to the entrance. Once you're back outside, you just have
<b>Floyd</b> | to get to your car and drive away.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nobody will get hurt, nobody will recognize you, and best of all,

<b>Floyd</b> | masks are all grotesque: One has a huge lower jaw and protruding tusks;
<b>Floyd</b> | one has shaggy sideburns, a lolling tongue and a goatee; the worst has

<b>Floyd</b> | Here's the entrance to Paco's Tacos, everyone's favorite place for a
<b>Floyd</b> | bite as long as everything else is closed. The stretch of sidewalk here
<b>Floyd</b> | is covered by a striped awning for the masses to huddle under while
<b>Floyd</b> | waiting for a table at peak hours. The door to the north is framed by
<b>Floyd</b> | neon signs behind plate glass windows. Further east is Get Your Licks.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now is a good time to go over the plan before you pull the job. It'd be
<b>Floyd</b> | nice if you had everything written down as a reminder, but a note like
<b>Floyd</b> | that could end up being incriminating. So, mentally, as you're standing
<b>Floyd</b> | here in front of the taco shop, remember:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Once you're inside, you're going to go north across the dining room, to
<b>Floyd</b> | where the counter is. Then you're going to point the gun at the cashier
<b>Floyd</b> | and, without hesitating, tell the cashier to open the cash register.
<b>Floyd</b> | When that's done, tell the cashier to take the money from the register
<b>Floyd</b> | and tell the cashier to give the money to you. (But don't say "to you",
<b>Floyd</b> | say "to me".) Finally, while still pointing the gun at the cashier,
<b>Floyd</b> | walk backward to the entrance. Once you're back outside, you just have
<b>Floyd</b> | to get to your car and drive away.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nobody will get hurt, nobody will recognize you, and best of all,
<b>Floyd</b> | nobody will get evicted.

<b>Floyd</b> | This is either an office or some sort of lounge: The walls are lined

<b>Floyd</b> | That pile of fat envelopes is here, but now they're all empty.
