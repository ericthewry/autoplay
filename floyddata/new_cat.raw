<b>Floyd</b> | I do not have a name, but I think that someday soon I will. I have
<b>Floyd</b> | heard Him talk many times of other things that have names, things like
<b>Floyd</b> | Mom, Dad, Emily, Stuart, God. So I think I will have a name someday
<b>Floyd</b> | soon, although I do not know how I get a name. Is it something I have
<b>Floyd</b> | to do? Is there somewhere I have to go? All I know is that for now, He
<b>Floyd</b> | calls me just one thing: Cat.

<b>Floyd</b> | Soft Place
<b>Floyd</b> | You live in a nice soft place inside a bigger space that has three
<b>Floyd</b> | ows, and one moveable ow. You call these things ows because they hurt
<b>Floyd</b> | when you run into them, and the moving ow (mow) only He can move. The
<b>Floyd</b> | soft place is where you sleep and it smells like you. Outside the soft
<b>Floyd</b> | space is where He puts the food and water. The food is ok, but the
<b>Floyd</b> | milk you used to have was much better. You wonder if He could get some
<b>Floyd</b> | of that again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He always shuts the mow, but today he has left it open. You do not
<b>Floyd</b> | know what is beyond it, except what you have heard him talk about.
<b>Floyd</b> | There is another thing called GoodCat/BadCat. It must have another
<b>Floyd</b> | name as well, because it was here when you got here, but it is far
<b>Floyd</b> | away and when He talks to it, you can only hear GoodCat or BadCat. You
<b>Floyd</b> | must be related, because you both are called Cat.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You have always wondered where He goes when He closes the mow and what
<b>Floyd</b> | lies beyond it. "Could there be even more mows and ows? Could my place
<b>Floyd</b> | be just one place inside a much bigger place? I want to find out.
<b>Floyd</b> | Maybe if I find out, I can get a name," you think.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Your Place surrounds the soft place. It's much bigger and it is soft
<b>Floyd</b> | on your feet, but not as soft as the soft place. You can run around
<b>Floyd</b> | here but the three ows stop you. Nothing has changed from this morning
<b>Floyd</b> | when He left -- the food dish, the water bowl, the sandbox, and the
<b>Floyd</b> | ledge are in their same places and they smell the same. The most
<b>Floyd</b> | interesting thing, though, is the mow. It's wide open in front of you

<b>Floyd</b> | like Him, a world filled with flying things and grass, clean scents

<b>Floyd</b> | were something soft enough to sleep on.  Mmrrow. You can't help
<b>Floyd</b> | yourself and rub lazily against it. It feels good. The solid mow on
<b>Floyd</b> | the opposite side greets you with a welcoming and familiar scent from

<b>Floyd</b> | Soft Place
<b>Floyd</b> | You live in a nice soft place inside a bigger space that has three
<b>Floyd</b> | ows, and one moveable ow. You call these things ows because they hurt
<b>Floyd</b> | when you run into them, and the moving ow (mow) only He can move. The
<b>Floyd</b> | soft place is where you sleep and it smells like you. Outside the soft
<b>Floyd</b> | space is where He puts the food and water. The food is ok, but the
<b>Floyd</b> | milk you used to have was much better. You wonder if He could get some
<b>Floyd</b> | of that again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He always shuts the mow, but today he has left it open. You do not
<b>Floyd</b> | know what is beyond it, except what you have heard him talk about.
<b>Floyd</b> | There is another thing called GoodCat/BadCat. It must have another
<b>Floyd</b> | name as well, because it was here when you got here, but it is far
<b>Floyd</b> | away and when He talks to it, you can only hear GoodCat or BadCat. You
<b>Floyd</b> | must be related, because you both are called Cat.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You have always wondered where He goes when He closes the mow and what
<b>Floyd</b> | lies beyond it. "Could there be even more mows and ows? Could my place
<b>Floyd</b> | be just one place inside a much bigger place? I want to find out.
<b>Floyd</b> | Maybe if I find out, I can get a name," you think.

<b>Floyd</b> | You live in a nice soft place inside a bigger space that has three
<b>Floyd</b> | ows, and one moveable ow. You call these things ows because they hurt
<b>Floyd</b> | when you run into them, and the moving ow (mow) only He can move. The
<b>Floyd</b> | soft place is where you sleep and it smells like you. Outside the soft
<b>Floyd</b> | space is where He puts the food and water. The food is ok, but the
<b>Floyd</b> | milk you used to have was much better. You wonder if He could get some
<b>Floyd</b> | of that again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He always shuts the mow, but today he has left it open. You do not
<b>Floyd</b> | know what is beyond it, except what you have heard him talk about.
<b>Floyd</b> | There is another thing called GoodCat/BadCat. It must have another
<b>Floyd</b> | name as well, because it was here when you got here, but it is far
<b>Floyd</b> | away and when He talks to it, you can only hear GoodCat or BadCat. You
<b>Floyd</b> | must be related, because you both are called Cat.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You have always wondered where He goes when He closes the mow and what
<b>Floyd</b> | lies beyond it. "Could there be even more mows and ows? Could my place

<b>Floyd</b> | This room is darker than the others, and a whole plethora of scents

<b>Floyd</b> | strongest smell is a fresh, clean smell that must be some kind of

<b>Floyd</b> | Halfway down the hall, the non-solid mow has slats from the top to the

<b>Floyd</b> | fresh smell that makes you want to lie down and go to sleep, if only
<b>Floyd</b> | there were something soft enough to sleep on.  The solid mow on the

<b>Floyd</b> | This is a comfortable room that also has strange things in it. The
<b>Floyd</b> | carpet gets very thick and comfortable in the middle of the room and
<b>Floyd</b> | it changes colors too. It even has tiny decorative brown paw prints
<b>Floyd</b> | across it. A narrow cloth bed (it looks like your bed, but it is so
<b>Floyd</b> | large that it must be for Him) touches the hall and beyond it is a
<b>Floyd</b> | wide cloth bed. Far away is a mow through which you can see the
<b>Floyd</b> | outside. Beside it is a plant that grows in a tall water dish. In the
<b>Floyd</b> | dirt scattered around the plant, you see several small paw prints. You
<b>Floyd</b> | grimace. Why did He put that nasty thing there? Near the plant there
<b>Floyd</b> | is a large black shiny square and a frozen bug on top of it, and
<b>Floyd</b> | beside the narrow bed is a puffy ball held in place by some kind of
<b>Floyd</b> | stick. The smells here fuse into one onrush of aroma that makes you
<b>Floyd</b> | feel relaxed and at home.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Soft Place</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | You live in a nice soft place inside a bigger space that has three
<b>Floyd</b> | ows, and one moveable ow. You call these things ows because they hurt
<b>Floyd</b> | when you run into them, and the moving ow (mow) only He can move. The
<b>Floyd</b> | soft place is where you sleep and it smells like you. Outside the soft
<b>Floyd</b> | space is where He puts the food and water. The food is ok, but the
<b>Floyd</b> | milk you used to have was much better. You wonder if He could get some
<b>Floyd</b> | of that again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He always shuts the mow, but today he has left it open. You do not
<b>Floyd</b> | know what is beyond it, except what you have heard him talk about.
<b>Floyd</b> | There is another thing called GoodCat/BadCat. It must have another
<b>Floyd</b> | name as well, because it was here when you got here, but it is far
<b>Floyd</b> | away and when He talks to it, you can only hear GoodCat or BadCat. You
<b>Floyd</b> | must be related, because you both are called Cat.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You have always wondered where He goes when He closes the mow and what
<b>Floyd</b> | lies beyond it. "Could there be even more mows and ows? Could my place
<b>Floyd</b> | be just one place inside a much bigger place? I want to find out.
<b>Floyd</b> | Maybe if I find out, I can get a name," you think.

<b>Floyd</b> | Halfway to the ceiling (it seems) a shiny surface ledge runs like a

<b>Floyd</b> | Directions are: forward, back(ward), left, right, up, and down. Most

<b>Floyd</b> | (against), scratch, bat, paw, jump to, jump over, jump down, meow
<b>Floyd</b> | (talk), and lick.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The point of the game is to explore the new world that is yours. The

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Score represents experience, and not all experiences are pleasant. You

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Halfway to the ceiling (it seems) a shiny surface ledge runs like a

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Soft Place</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | You live in a nice soft place inside a bigger space that has three
<b>Floyd</b> | ows, and one moveable ow. You call these things ows because they hurt
<b>Floyd</b> | when you run into them, and the moving ow (mow) only He can move. The
<b>Floyd</b> | soft place is where you sleep and it smells like you. Outside the soft
<b>Floyd</b> | space is where He puts the food and water. The food is ok, but the
<b>Floyd</b> | milk you used to have was much better. You wonder if He could get some
<b>Floyd</b> | of that again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He always shuts the mow, but today he has left it open. You do not
<b>Floyd</b> | know what is beyond it, except what you have heard him talk about.
<b>Floyd</b> | There is another thing called GoodCat/BadCat. It must have another
<b>Floyd</b> | name as well, because it was here when you got here, but it is far
<b>Floyd</b> | away and when He talks to it, you can only hear GoodCat or BadCat. You
<b>Floyd</b> | must be related, because you both are called Cat.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You have always wondered where He goes when He closes the mow and what
<b>Floyd</b> | lies beyond it. "Could there be even more mows and ows? Could my place
<b>Floyd</b> | be just one place inside a much bigger place? I want to find out.
<b>Floyd</b> | Maybe if I find out, I can get a name," you think.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You easily jump up on the table, your claws clutching the threaded
<b>Floyd</b> | surface.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Brown Table</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | This is a small place, a little bit larger than the soft place but not
<b>Floyd</b> | as large as the place around it. If you ran around here, you'd
<b>Floyd</b> | definitely fall off the edges. The floor feels like a bunch of string,
<b>Floyd</b> | tightly wound together and it is arranged in colors and in patterns of
<b>Floyd</b> | things you don't recognize. From here, you can see a shiny surface you
<b>Floyd</b> | could easily jump to, and you can view most of the room and the next
<b>Floyd</b> | room over, which pulls your kittenish heart with what looks like large
<b>Floyd</b> | and soft beds. Taking a quick sniff, you realize that this area is
<b>Floyd</b> | used for eating food, but there is no food here now.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see a phone here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You hear several different scary sounds and then people talking,
<b>Floyd</b> | seriously.

<b>Floyd</b> | That doesn't look far away. You take a quick look and with a little
<b>Floyd</b> | jump you land safely on the countertop.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Countertop</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | From up here, you can see the entire shiny place. Only the

<b>Floyd</b> | important, like perhaps you controlled the whole area and had a few
<b>Floyd</b> | cat soldiers to do your bidding as well. If it was softer and not so
<b>Floyd</b> | narrow, it would make a great bed. From here, you can jump up to the
