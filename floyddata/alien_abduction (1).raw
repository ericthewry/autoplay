The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Roofed</i>, written by Jim Munroe, and <I>Alien Abduction?</I>, written by Charles Gerlach.  The first game of the day, <I>Roofed</I>, was originally released as part of the Casual Gameplay Design Competition 7, where it took fifth place. The second game of the day, <I>Alien Abduction?</I>, was originally released as part of the 1996 Interactive Fiction competition, where it took ninth place.  You can learn more about these games, including how to download them, by visiting the the ifWiki sites for <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Roofed'><U>Roofed</U></A> and <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Alien_Abduction%3F'><u>Alien Abduction?</u></A>, respectively.</br></br>If you'd like, you can skip straight to the <a href="#alien"><U><I>Alien Abduction?</I></U></A> transcript.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> |    rampage,  the people of Springfield have not
<b>Floyd</b> |    forgotten.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |       Upon hearing that the home considered him
<b>Floyd</b> |    rehabilitated and was considering  releasing
<b>Floyd</b> |    him early, a large crowd gathered around the
<b>Floyd</b> |    Mayor's office and staged a  loud protest on
<b>Floyd</b> |    his lawn.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |       The mayor promised to do his best to stop
<b>Floyd</b> |    Knott's release, but unless the county comes
<b>Floyd</b> |    up with more  money for  the facility,  they
<b>Floyd</b> |    will have to release twenty patients and lay
<b>Floyd</b> |    off several staff members in order to remain
<b>Floyd</b> |    operational.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |       A spokesman for the complex said: "We are
<b>Floyd</b> |    only thinking of releasing those individuals
<b>Floyd</b> |    that  have  responded  completely  to  their

<b>Floyd</b> |        At  the  urgings  of his  lawyer,  Knott
<b>Floyd</b> |    pleaded  no contest at  his hearing  and has
<b>Floyd</b> |    been  committed  to an institution  for  the
<b>Floyd</b> |    criminally insane.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The other is from just two weeks ago:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Springfield --  Although ten years  have passed
<b>Floyd</b> |    since  Peter Knott  went  on  his  murderous
<b>Floyd</b> |    rampage,  the people of Springfield have not
<b>Floyd</b> |    forgotten.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |       Upon hearing that the home considered him
<b>Floyd</b> |    rehabilitated and was considering  releasing
<b>Floyd</b> |    him early, a large crowd gathered around the
<b>Floyd</b> |    Mayor's office and staged a  loud protest on
<b>Floyd</b> |    his lawn.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |       The mayor promised to do his best to stop
<b>Floyd</b> |    Knott's release, but unless the county comes
<b>Floyd</b> |    up with more  money for  the facility,  they
<b>Floyd</b> |    will have to release twenty patients and lay
<b>Floyd</b> |    off several staff members in order to remain
<b>Floyd</b> |    operational.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |       A spokesman for the complex said: "We are
<b>Floyd</b> |    only thinking of releasing those individuals
<b>Floyd</b> |    that  have  responded  completely  to  their
<b>Floyd</b> |    therapy and that  we believe  pose no threat
<b>Floyd</b> |    to themselves or to others."
