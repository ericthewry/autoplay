						<strong><I>Hunger Daemon</I> by Sean M. Shore</strong><br/>
						
						<span class="fontish smallest">As played on ifMUD on October 23, 2014</span>
					</p>


					<p class="leftalign">
					<span class="fontish smaller">Like ClubFloyd, the idea behind NightFloyd is that a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.<br><br>Unlike ClubFloyd, NightFloyd often takes on significantly larger works of interactive fiction, knowing going in that each one will take multiple sessions (but not always, as you'll see in this transcript). NightFloyd is also a bit more informal than ClubFloyd in that it's only announced on the ifMUD #clubfloyd bulletin board, and the time shifts around to meet player's schedules far more than ClubFloyd does. NightFloyd is organized by genericgeekgirl, aka Adri.<br>						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<I>Hunger Daemon</I> by Sean M. Shore.
						<I>Hunger Daemon</I> took first place in the 2014 Interactive Fiction Competition, and went on to be nominated for Best Game and Best Implementation in the 2014 Xyzzy Awards. 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting

					</span><br>
					<br>
					
						
					
					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing this game, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played this game, and think you might like to at some
						point, I do not recommend reading any further. Instead,
						you might want to return to the <a class="decorate" href=

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Restaurant Basement</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | You're in the basement of a defunct little bistro in the West 7th
<b>Floyd</b> | neighborhood of Saint Paul.  This is where your cult does most of its
<b>Floyd</b> | culting, on account of how your Aunt Sandy doesn't want any sacrifices
<b>Floyd</b> | in the house, and well, fair enough.  Uncle Stu owns the building, so
<b>Floyd</b> | you're not squatting or anything, but he's kept the place in a state
<b>Floyd</b> | of perpetual Coming Soonedness, so that you all can do your thing here
<b>Floyd</b> | with no interference.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As I say, <span class="floydstyle em">defunct</span> bistro, so the restaurant-type stuff you'd
<b>Floyd</b> | normally find here is mostly gone.  In their place there's a group of
<b>Floyd</b> | guys wearing hooded robes, facing an altar at one end of the chamber.
<b>Floyd</b> | Your Uncle Stu has a lectern in front of him, atop which is a decrepit
<b>Floyd</b> | leather-bound book from which he is chanting.  There's a wooden stair
<b>Floyd</b> | leading to the pantry above and a winged horror slumped in a folding
<b>Floyd</b> | chair in the corner.

</b><b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">( - About and Credits)</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Hunger Daemon</span> is an entry in the 2014 Interactive Fiction
<b>Floyd</b> | Competition.  There are a couple of short timed sequences where it is
<b>Floyd</b> | possible to lock yourself out of victory for a move or two, but it
<b>Floyd</b> | will be very obvious when this happens, because the game will end.
<b>Floyd</b> | Outside of that, the various "winning" endings should always be
<b>Floyd</b> | available.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To initiate a conversation with a character, you can TALK TO the
<b>Floyd</b> | character, or SAY HELLO TO her, or ASK her ABOUT or TELL her ABOUT
<b>Floyd</b> | something.  Use TOPICS to display conversation topics.  Occasionally a
<b>Floyd</b> | character might respond to something not in her topics list.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can use GO TO to return to places you've already been.   There are
<b>Floyd</b> | also a few other nonstandard verbs.  I hope that they're obvious in
<b>Floyd</b> | context.  Note: you might find yourself needing to INFLATE or SQUEEZE
<b>Floyd</b> | or REMEMBER some things.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks to Graham Nelson and Emily Short for Inform 7, and to Eric Eve,
<b>Floyd</b> | David Fisher and Wade Clarke for very helpful extensions.  All praise
<b>Floyd</b> | to my testers: Sam Kabo Ashwell, Neil Butters, Bob Reeves, Gráinne
<b>Floyd</b> | Ryan, Andrew Schultz, and Steven Westwood.  Any remaining shortcomings
<b>Floyd</b> | or errors in this game are wholly my responsibility.  Lovecraftian

<b>Floyd</b> | You're in Carver's Cave, a small natural fissure underneath Saint

<b>Floyd</b> | the city would open it back up again, until finally they chose to
<b>Floyd</b> | block it off entirely.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There's a beach of sorts, and beyond that, a calm, dark pool extending
<b>Floyd</b> | into the blackness.  Water laps gently near your feet, and there's an
<b>Floyd</b> | audible trickle from somewhere deep in the darkness.  It's otherwise
<b>Floyd</b> | deathly quiet, and very chilly.  You can leave to the south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lying on the beach is the hacked-up corpse of a giant serpent,

<b>Floyd</b> | "Sweet!" says Jeff.  "Alright, dude.  Showtime."  He gathers up some
<b>Floyd</b> | crap from behind the counter and leads you downstairs, to the shrine
<b>Floyd</b> | of Great Cthulhu, peace be upon him.  Jeff starts by drawing a
<b>Floyd</b> | trapezoid on the wood floor with a piece of chalk.  "Hey, better get
<b>Floyd</b> | your robe on," he says.  "Make this all official-like.  I think the
<b>Floyd</b> | big guys like it when we're dressed for the part."  Seems reasonable,
<b>Floyd</b> | so you comply.  "Sit on this side," he says, pointing to the wide end;
<b>Floyd</b> | he himself sits at the narrow end.  OK, yeah, this is starting to come
<b>Floyd</b> | back to you now.  He scrawls out an Elder Sign in the middle, and then
<b>Floyd</b> | lights a candle on either side of you.  He dips into a bag of, well,
<b>Floyd</b> | it looks like red sand, but is probably something like granulated
<b>Floyd</b> | Shoggoth nightmares.  Wait, no -- the bag is from Petco.  Anyway, he
<b>Floyd</b> | sprinkles that around a bit, then places the printout of the woman and
<b>Floyd</b> | her hairclip in the center, on top of the sign.  He grabs your hands
<b>Floyd</b> | and closes his eyes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "OK, so now repeat after me:  <span class="floydstyle em">Ehye f'geb Tsathoggua wgah'n</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">k'yarnak gof'nn...</span>"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I forget Tsathoggua vogon kayak golfing..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This goes on for much longer than you were hoping.  Finally Jeff
<b>Floyd</b> | yells, "Iä! Iä!"  The sand begins to swirl around until it resolves
<b>Floyd</b> | into the form of a street map.  Wow, this is pretty bitchin'.  You can
<b>Floyd</b> | feel power flowing through you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Barry, get ready!  Watch for the spark!"  At this, the image and the
<b>Floyd</b> | hairclip are consumed in brilliant green flames, accompanied by thick
<b>Floyd</b> | smoke.  The fumes begin to sting your eyes and nose.  You're tearing
<b>Floyd</b> | up, and you feel an insistent itch in your nasal passages.  A sneeze

<b>Floyd</b> | Pandemonium grips the main sanctuary of the synagogue.  Your Uncle
<b>Floyd</b> | Stu, transformed by the daylong ritual you escaped, clutches a

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (first taking the shofar)
<b>Floyd</b> | You leap over to the podium and grab the horn.  Seized by a sudden
<b>Floyd</b> | flash of insight and pity, you inhale until you're full to bursting,
<b>Floyd</b> | and put the horn to your lips.  You sound a massive, deep blast that
<b>Floyd</b> | reverberates against the walls of the sanctuary.  You keep the blast
<b>Floyd</b> | going, a single piercing note, forcing the air from your lungs until
<b>Floyd</b> | they begin to ache.  You look up, and see the congregation recovering.
<b>Floyd</b> | The horn's blast is drowning out the crystal!  Leah slowly uncurls
<b>Floyd</b> | herself, opens her eyes, and sees you sounding the horn.  She seems
<b>Floyd</b> | oddly calm now, and starts to crawl away.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Still you blow, your face turning red, then purple, the same note
<b>Floyd</b> | sounding, shaking the very walls of the temple.  You close your eyes
<b>Floyd</b> | as you expel the last bit of air.  Finally, there's a cracking sound,
<b>Floyd</b> | and a pulse of white light.  The crystal shatters.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The rabbi stands, a trickle of blood running along his jawline and
<b>Floyd</b> | down his chin.  "<span class="floydstyle em">Tekiah gedolah!</span>" he shouts, as the other
<b>Floyd</b> | congregants snap out of their fugues.  Suddenly, there's another
<b>Floyd</b> | crack, and your dumbstruck uncle crumples to the ground.  Standing
<b>Floyd</b> | over him is Leah, clutching a Torah in both hands.  Her face is caked
<b>Floyd</b> | with blood, her dress dirty and wrinkled, her mascara running in thick
<b>Floyd</b> | black streaks down her face.  She looks up at you and smiles.  She's
<b>Floyd</b> | the most beautiful woman you've ever seen.  Three Saint Paul policemen
<b>Floyd</b> | burst in with tasers and handcuffs, but frankly, their job has been
<b>Floyd</b> | done for them.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I knew you couldn't be all bad," Leah says, between strained breaths.
<b>Floyd</b> | "You were so gentle with my roommate's beagle when we brought her in
<b>Floyd</b> | with a scratched eye last winter.  It was really sweet."  At this, she
<b>Floyd</b> | throws up.  Still, it's a nice moment.
