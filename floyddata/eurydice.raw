					<p class="leftalign">
					<span class="fontish smaller">The idea behind ClubFloyd

						people meet online to cooperatively play a game of 
						interactive fiction.<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Eurydice</em> written by Anonymous.
						<I>Eurydice</I> was released as part of the 2012 Interactive Fiction Competition, in which it took second place. 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting

					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of

</b><b>Floyd</b> | Eurydice isn't exactly over-endowed with special commands because I
<b>Floyd</b> | lack the programming werewithall for anything that cool.  I hope most
<b>Floyd</b> | of the things you might want to do are accomodated in the body of the
<b>Floyd</b> | game anyway and that context-specific actions are adequately sign
<b>Floyd</b> | posted.  But you might want to consider the following: PLAY (a musical
<b>Floyd</b> | instrument should you acquire one), TALK TO (for interacting with
<b>Floyd</b> | people) and TURN AROUND (under a very specific set of circumstances).
<b>Floyd</b> | I would also recommend that you try repeating actions if it seems
<b>Floyd</b> | appropriate, since you will likely find they have different outcomes -
<b>Floyd</b> | especially when it comes to talking to people.  With reference to
<b>Floyd</b> | TURNING AROUND, if you happen to be in a situation in which it might
<b>Floyd</b> | not be ideal to TURN AROUND, doubling back on yourself will also
<b>Floyd</b> | count.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And many many many thanks to my long-suffering, unsuspecting beta
<b>Floyd</b> | testers: Issy, Guy, Julian, Jessica, Dan, Shim and Arthur, with
<b>Floyd</b> | special thanks to Issy for the lovely artwork.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Also, um, to Emily Short (who has no idea who I am - and for that
<b>Floyd</b> | matter I don't know who she is) but without her I wouldn't know a damn
<b>Floyd</b> | thing about Inform 7.  In all honesty, I still don't know that much.
<b>Floyd</b> | The actual coding underpinning this thing is a terrible mess, but
<b>Floyd</b> | that's not Emily Short's fault.  Pro tip: if you want to learn how to
<b>Floyd</b> | use Inform 7 don't start with an absurdly convoluted story about

<b>Floyd</b> | Celine's gifts, it came exquisitely wrapped - black and gold, perhaps,
<b>Floyd</b> | to match the mask itself.  You wonder if Celine's box of wrapping
<b>Floyd</b> | paper, ribbons and decorations is still beneath the eaves, or if her
<b>Floyd</b> | parents took that too.  "Why go to all that trouble for something
<b>Floyd</b> | that's just going to be ripped off?" you'd ask.  But Celine loved the
<b>Floyd</b> | ephemeral.  And, so, apparently did you.

<b>Floyd</b> | The extensive living / dining area was one of the features that drew

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Currently, it's all cluttered with people. Your housemate John is
<b>Floyd</b> | sitting cross-legged on the floor at the end of the coffee table,
<b>Floyd</b> | frowning over a game of a Go.  His opponent, Twitch, sits opposite and
<b>Floyd</b> | appears much more laid-back about the whole business.  Rick is slumped
<b>Floyd</b> | on the sofa, a bottle of port at his elbow; Elsie is sitting next to
<b>Floyd</b> | him, apparently watching the game.  Jess is huddled in a cloak on the
<b>Floyd</b> | other sofa, Adrian beside her, looking almost as uncomfortable as you
<b>Floyd</b> | feel.  As for Laurie (fucking Laurie), she's leaning against the
<b>Floyd</b> | fireplace, and wearing an expression of infinite suffering like she's
<b>Floyd</b> | living her own little Victorian melodrama
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The coat stand is still in its corner, looming like an unexpected

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Currently, it's all cluttered with people. Your housemate John is
<b>Floyd</b> | sitting cross-legged on the floor at the end of the coffee table,
<b>Floyd</b> | frowning over a game of a Go.  His opponent, Twitch, sits opposite and
<b>Floyd</b> | appears much more laid-back about the whole business.  Rick is slumped
<b>Floyd</b> | on the sofa, a bottle of port at his elbow; Elsie is sitting next to
<b>Floyd</b> | him, apparently watching the game.  Jess is huddled in a cloak on the
<b>Floyd</b> | other sofa, Adrian beside her, looking almost as uncomfortable as you
<b>Floyd</b> | feel.  As for Laurie (fucking Laurie), she's leaning against the
<b>Floyd</b> | fireplace, and wearing an expression of infinite suffering like she's
<b>Floyd</b> | living her own little Victorian melodrama
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The coat stand is still in its corner, looming like an unexpected
<b>Floyd</b> | guest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your escape routes are east into the kitchen, or south into the hall.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Jess and Adrian converse in soft whispers.

<b>Floyd</b> | her, back to the wall, feet dangling off the end of the bed.  You'd
<b>Floyd</b> | snuck in and you're kneeling on the floor, elbows folded on the

<b>Floyd</b> | between you are brightly coloured cards. You're playing Once Upon A
<b>Floyd</b> | Time, a game for telling fairytales.  "Are you sure I used to like
<b>Floyd</b> | this?" Celine is asking.  "Yes," you say, "it's one of your
<b>Floyd</b> | favourites."  "You used to win all the time," Jess adds.  Celine
<b>Floyd</b> | laughs, uncertain.  "That doesn't seem very likely," she says.  "It'll

<b>Floyd</b> | course, doesn't.  None of it does.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A small, perfectly square, yellow-painted room, probably identical to

<b>Floyd</b> | You are standing on the pavement outside your house.  The street looks
<b>Floyd</b> | exactly as it always looks, except evening has crept fully across the
<b>Floyd</b> | sky during your wanderings and the nascent night is definitely cold.
<b>Floyd</b> | You are conscious, for a second or two, of a vague nagging feeling, as
<b>Floyd</b> | if you have left something behind, but it passes swiftly.  Hinksey
<b>Floyd</b> | Park still lies, like a shadow, to the northwest and the rest of the

<b>Floyd</b> | running a reverent finger over one of the leaves.  "I'll love her, I

<b>Floyd</b> | As soon as you enter his office, the Doctor's attention flies to the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The woman meets his ardent gaze with disinterest.  "There's something
<b>Floyd</b> | you can do for my friend here," she says.  "And don't give me the
<b>Floyd</b> | usual rubbish about the rules, I know just how flexible your rules can
<b>Floyd</b> | be."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "That was an isolated incident," he replies, flushing. He seems to
<b>Floyd</b> | have forgotten you're standing there, because he blurts out his next
<b>Floyd</b> | words with a terrible, naked earnestness: "I know I have wronged you
<b>Floyd</b> | but I cannot ... that is ... I need ... " His hand moves compulsively
<b>Floyd</b> | to his heart as if he means to pluck it out and offer it to her, but
<b>Floyd</b> | she glares him back to silence.  Finally, he says, with something of
<b>Floyd</b> | his customary coldness: "I would do anything to assure your comfort
<b>Floyd</b> | while you're here with me."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She thrusts the plant into his face.  "Then I want this," she says.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I offer you my kingdom and all you want is a weed?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  She shrugs.  "You'll never understand."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Very well," says the Doctor, finally.  "Since you ask it of me."  He
<b>Floyd</b> | turns on you, contempt scored across his face. "You'll find Celine in
<b>Floyd</b> | the gardens beyond the Sun Room.  Take her with you, as you wish, but
<b>Floyd</b> | don't look back or she's mine forever."  And that seems to be the
<b>Floyd</b> | mattered settled.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The woman, still cradling the houseplant drifts out.  She does not

<b>Floyd</b> | favourites."  "You used to win all the time," Jess adds.  Celine
<b>Floyd</b> | laughs, uncertain.  "That doesn't seem very likely," she says.  "It'll

<b>Floyd</b> | A small, perfectly square, yellow-painted room, probably identical to

<b>Floyd</b> | It is a transitory space.  Above the bed, the wall is splashed with a

<b>Floyd</b> | The extensive living / dining area was one of the features that drew
<b>Floyd</b> | you all to this house when you were looking for places to rent.  That
<b>Floyd</b> | and - despite the fact none of you have been able to bring yourself to
<b>Floyd</b> | do anything as prosaic as cleaning for days - the fact it's not an
<b>Floyd</b> | abject shit hole like most of places on offer when you were doing the
<b>Floyd</b> | rounds.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Currently, it's all cluttered with people. Your housemate John is
<b>Floyd</b> | sitting cross-legged on the floor at the end of the coffee table,
<b>Floyd</b> | frowning over a game of a Go.  His opponent, Twitch, sits opposite and
<b>Floyd</b> | appears much more laid-back about the whole business.  Rick is slumped
<b>Floyd</b> | on the sofa, a bottle of port at his elbow; Elsie is sitting next to
<b>Floyd</b> | him, apparently watching the game.  Jess is huddled in a cloak on the
<b>Floyd</b> | other sofa, Adrian beside her, looking almost as uncomfortable as you
<b>Floyd</b> | feel.  As for Laurie (fucking Laurie), she's leaning against the
<b>Floyd</b> | fireplace, and wearing an expression of infinite suffering like she's
<b>Floyd</b> | living her own little Victorian melodrama
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You muster up your courage and sidle past the subdued monster, holding
<b>Floyd</b> | your breath lest you rouse it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Warneford Hospital Approach</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | You could be visiting a stately home, or an Oxford college, or a
<b>Floyd</b> | country church, except you're not.  You know there are more modern
<b>Floyd</b> | constructions hidden away behind it, one of which - the severely acute
<b>Floyd</b> | ward - lies like Sleeping Beauty's castle behind thorns of metal and
<b>Floyd</b> | stone.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Circling an oval of moderately well-kept grass is a gravel path and,
<b>Floyd</b> | beyond it to the west, a sandstone building gleams palely golden
<b>Floyd</b> | against the shadowed sky. The gates loom to the northwest.

<b>Floyd</b> | As you cross the lawn, your footsteps lost among the many you have

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Path</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | The path sidles away down the side of the main building, taking you
<b>Floyd</b> | away from facades.  Here, there are no country house lawns, no
<b>Floyd</b> | sandstone and classical pillars. There are patches of scrubby grass,
<b>Floyd</b> | borders that may perhaps bloom one spring, and scattered buildings
<b>Floyd</b> | that are too perfectly, facelessly functional to have anything of
<b>Floyd</b> | beauty or ugliness to them.  There are jaunty painted signs to

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Vaughan Thomas waits to the west, the Hospital Approach is to the

<b>Floyd</b> | Vaughan Thomas Ward is another grey building.  It has a bow-window

<b>Floyd</b> | You look around for the nurse but then notice that the door seems to

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Vaughan Thomas Exterior</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | Vaughan Thomas Ward is another grey building.  It has a bow-window
<b>Floyd</b> | which looks like an ill-at-ease addition to its uniformity.  There is
<b>Floyd</b> | also an awkward, spindly tree guarding a nearby bench.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The only thing that follows you now, it seems, is silence.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The door that leads west into Vaughan Thomas has been painted blue.
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a doorbell next to it in industrial grey.  The path leading
<b>Floyd</b> | to and from Vaughan Thomas lies to the east.

<b>Floyd</b> | The path sidles away down the side of the main building, taking you
<b>Floyd</b> | away from facades.  Here, there are no country house lawns, no
<b>Floyd</b> | sandstone and classical pillars. There are patches of scrubby grass,
<b>Floyd</b> | borders that may perhaps bloom one spring, and scattered buildings
<b>Floyd</b> | that are too perfectly, facelessly functional to have anything of
<b>Floyd</b> | beauty or ugliness to them.  There are jaunty painted signs to
<b>Floyd</b> | Cotswold House and Wintle Ward.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Vaughan Thomas waits to the west, the Hospital Approach is to the
<b>Floyd</b> | east.

<b>Floyd</b> | Here on the Warneford lawn again you can see a streak of lightness at

<b>Floyd</b> | the Warneford.  Before you, to the northwest, the wrought iron gates,

<b>Floyd</b> | You run through the gates and, as soon as both feet are indisputably

<b>Floyd</b> | before you, looking no different to the last time you saw her alive,
<b>Floyd</b> | is too much for you. You fall but soft grass catches you, and laughter
<b>Floyd</b> | as heady as wine comes bubbling out of your mouth. Eurydice leans over
<b>Floyd</b> | you, while behind her the darkness peels away from the sky like a
<b>Floyd</b> | layer of dead skin.  There is a moment of confusion.  You feel an
<b>Floyd</b> | inexplicable coldness seeping into your skin from what should be the
<b>Floyd</b> | sun-warmed grass, and there is a babble of concerned voices - the
<b>Floyd</b> | wrong voices - calling out a name - the wrong name.  But then Eurydice
<b>Floyd</b> | kisses you and her lips are flower-petal soft and her mouth tastes of
<b>Floyd</b> | music and the sky is the colour of lapis-lazuli and, on the breeze,
<b>Floyd</b> | comes the scent of olive trees...
