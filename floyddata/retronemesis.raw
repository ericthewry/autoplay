ClubFloyd Transcript:<BR><B>The Hugo Open House Competition (Session II) by Various Authors</b></FONT><FONT FACE='arial, sans-serif, helvetica' SIZE='1'></BR>As played on ifMUD on January 22, 2012</FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2">
The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is the second of two transcripts of the games in the <i>The Hugo Open House Competition</i>, written by various authors (the first session transcript can be found <A HREF="http://www.allthingsjacq.com/intfic_clubfloyd_20120103.html"><U>here</U></A>). 

</BR></BR>It should be noted that one of the games, <I>Party Arty, Man of La Munchie</I> by Jonathan Blask as "Roody Yogurt", is not found in this transcript, as it was also released as part of the The penultimate not numbered New Year's Speed IF, and ClubFloyd has already played it; that game's transcript can be found <A HREF="http://www.allthingsjacq.com/intfic_clubfloyd_20120102.html#g3"><U>here</U></A>. There was also a seventh game in this 'competition', <I>Teleporter Test</I> by Paul Robinson, that was added late, and ClubFloyd was unfortunately not aware of it when the Hugo Open House Competition sessions occurred.

</BR></BR>You can learn more about all these games, including how to download them, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/The_Hugo_%22Open_House%22_Competition'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</BR></BR>

<b>Floyd</b> |   I'm in a tattoo parlor, getting the Zork logo inked on my forearm, in
<b>Floyd</b> | order to get more screen time for the "GET LAMP" documentary. Jason
<b>Floyd</b> | Scott is here, grinning like the Sentient Demon Sun on the day mankind
<b>Floyd</b> | slowly discerns that there has always been a second, sentient, demon
<b>Floyd</b> | sun. He switched the original "Zork" logo the artist was using for
<b>Floyd</b> | reference with the one from Zork III when the guy was
<b>Floyd</b> | self-administrating a body shot. I'm no stranger to drinking on the
<b>Floyd</b> | job, but the artist pooled the booze in the  "o" of his self-stenciled
<b>Floyd</b> | "MOM" tattoo before lighting it on fire. So I'm sufficiently distracted
<b>Floyd</b> | to where I don't realize that the guy is painfully drawing in extra
<b>Floyd</b> | Roman numerals until it's too late.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Scott's filming the whole thing, panning up to my grimacing. The Zork
<b>Floyd</b> | logo is made up of a bunch of little rocks, and the surface area for
<b>Floyd</b> | the extra ones is greater than that of a big batch of Safeway-Brand
<b>Floyd</b> | discount popcorn chicken. I can't even remember why "being on film" was
<b>Floyd</b> | so important to me, except that I wanted more exposure than Kent
<b>Floyd</b> | Tessman, CM, that smug bastard. Scott had a deal for me: First, help
<b>Floyd</b> | him break into Adam Thornton's second home in Canada, so we can film
<b>Floyd</b> | ourselves torching the place in order to dramatize the ending of
<b>Floyd</b> | Trinity. And secondly, be the subject for "the tattoo scene" to show
<b>Floyd</b> | how crazy text game fans are. I'd get featured in seven extra clips by
<b>Floyd</b> | doing all this.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "How many clips am I in now?" I asked. I'm fucking shrewd, just look at
<b>Floyd</b> | me. If it were like four or something, well, I'm no fool. Four clips is
<b>Floyd</b> | enough to splice together a Youtube video with and get some thoughtful
<b>Floyd</b> | comments, maybe even some that don't bash women, wets or Jews.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "This many," he said, holding up a copy of Zork Zero with his hand over
<b>Floyd</b> | the "Zork" part. Fuck!

<b>Floyd</b> | The Basement
<b>Floyd</b> |   We had that tattoo conversation in Colorado after I had my original
<b>Floyd</b> | interview that was useless to him. He had driven out from Wisconsin.
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm not actually that great with geography, so if that's impossible
<b>Floyd</b> | because of the Thousand Lakes or the precipice of a gaping chasm, then
<b>Floyd</b> | I guess he took a ferry. He bought hookers for the interview in an
<b>Floyd</b> | attempt to relax me beforehand, but one of them was scorching hot and
<b>Floyd</b> | looked like a girl I never got in high school, so I kept messing up
<b>Floyd</b> | what I was trying to say and making everything worse. Plus, it all took
<b>Floyd</b> | place in my basement, which is pretty much just an old oriental rug and
<b>Floyd</b> | nine Mr. Do! cabinets in various states of disuse.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The one gal I was trying to get the phone number of was down to pasties
<b>Floyd</b> | and heels when there was a knock on the door. Normally that doesn't
<b>Floyd</b> | happen that much because 1) I live like a disgusting orc at the bottom
<b>Floyd</b> | of a spider-pit and 2) I have a self-styled moat around the house,
<b>Floyd</b> | consisting of that week's curry oil, a kraken and old Monster Energy
<b>Floyd</b> | Drink cans that I "recycle" back into the "environment" by my lonesome.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Who is it?" I bellowed. I hoped that taking charge of the situation
<b>Floyd</b> | would impress the girl I liked, but she was a hooker. Without even
<b>Floyd</b> | answering, five guys from the Lyons Pinball Team came downstairs. I
<b>Floyd</b> | recognized them instantly: the Jerk Who Monopolizes the Fireball
<b>Floyd</b> | Machine, the Bastard Who Monopolizes the Orbitor 1 machine, the
<b>Floyd</b> | Whoreson Who Monopolizes the Twilight Zone Machine and two guys who
<b>Floyd</b> | constantly play grabass near the bill change machine.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Who the fuck are these guys?" I asked Scott anyway.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Got my fingers in a lot of pies," he said, while at the same time
<b>Floyd</b> | knuckle-deep into the one called Chillaxxx.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After a little while it registered to him that, no, seriously, I wanted
<b>Floyd</b> | to know what those guys were doing here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm filming them after you, and I needed to consolidate some things.
<b>Floyd</b> | You girls don't mind, do you?" The girls shook their heads and
<b>Floyd</b> | tittered; who knows what that means.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There is an extremely beautiful girl waiting to have sex with me here.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Van
<b>Floyd</b> |   Back in the present time, I paid the tattoo artist. I was actually
<b>Floyd</b> | racking up a substantial bill on this excursion. I usually bribe the
<b>Floyd</b> | border guard when I travel to Canada, since I am too repulsive to just
<b>Floyd</b> | be let into most NATO countries without a lot of paperwork, bother and
<b>Floyd</b> | disapprovingly clucked tongues. But more people means more bribing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I haven't bribed this many people since I played Exodus: Ultima III."
<b>Floyd</b> | It's not a text game reference, so Scott doesn't acknowledge it. Which
<b>Floyd</b> | is fair, because I rarely got satisfying replies from anyone in that
<b>Floyd</b> | game. That's where the comparisons really end, though, because at no
<b>Floyd</b> | point in Exodus did Dupre or Chuckles tell you that every time they
<b>Floyd</b> | travel to Canada, they're consumed by the desire to snuff out a handful
<b>Floyd</b> | of lives.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Not just any humans," Scott says. "It's Canadians I specifically
<b>Floyd</b> | loathe, which is why I'm letting you work out your little dominance
<b>Floyd</b> | issues with Tessman on my dime." I attempt to interrupt, in order to
<b>Floyd</b> | remind him who bribed whom, when he shuts me up by hinting at a scrap
<b>Floyd</b> | of a story that features Steve Meretzky, my idol. But he goes back to
<b>Floyd</b> | talking about his true passion: killing off animals.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "But you know how, if you are really into cake but can't have it, you
<b>Floyd</b> | might take up smoking?" I'm hypnotized by this point by the idea that I
<b>Floyd</b> | might get an untold tidbit from Planetfall, so I just sort of go along
<b>Floyd</b> | with it all. I tell him 'sure.' "It's the same thing with me. I come
<b>Floyd</b> | from a long line of famous Scotts, who bagged the big game. Tigers,
<b>Floyd</b> | lions, blue whales, probably a Rakasha in there, too, for all I know.
<b>Floyd</b> | Well, it just so happens that it's illegal to film yourself killing
<b>Floyd</b> | animal after animal, using the stuff I have in that bag." He makes a
<b>Floyd</b> | dismissive wanking noise. He then points to the bag on the floor in
<b>Floyd</b> | front of me. "Could you get me the lens in there." He doesn't phrase it
<b>Floyd</b> | as a question.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Snowy Trail
<b>Floyd</b> |   Scott takes in the wonderful nature and hocks a loogie into a drift.
<b>Floyd</b> | "We're hunting something called the Beast of Exmoor," he sneers. "It
<b>Floyd</b> | just so happens to be at Adam Thornton's house."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Did you know he had a MAME machine?" I ask.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I know the location of every single MAME and JAMMA machine in the
<b>Floyd</b> | western hemisphere," he says. "Ask me the pinouts! ASK ME THE FUCKING
<b>Floyd</b> | PINOUTS!" I do, because he might have a gun in the van. With the way
<b>Floyd</b> | this trip is going, I might suddenly learn that he can turn himself
<b>Floyd</b> | into a gun, all like Galvatron but with Scourge's goatee. He starts
<b>Floyd</b> | listing off voltages and I do the right-hand rule a couple times to
<b>Floyd</b> | mime like I am following along. I usually do this sort of thing at
<b>Floyd</b> | work, when one of my co-workers starts talking about Java. I don't mind
<b>Floyd</b> | programming in Java, but I can't stand to hear other people talk about
<b>Floyd</b> | it. This creates a few problems for me that I end up having to hear
<b>Floyd</b> | about at my yearly performance review. After confirming that he's not
<b>Floyd</b> | going to launch into a Meretzky story any time soon, I let my mind
<b>Floyd</b> | wander. When did it go all wrong?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It occurs to me that it went all wrong when I let the hookers in, so
<b>Floyd</b> | it's a pretty quick self-reflection.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thornton's house is to the north. I'm not just saying that because I

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I actually do want to interview Thornton for this 'documentary',"
<b>Floyd</b> | sneers Scott, as we get into the right ZIP code, or whatever they use
<b>Floyd</b> | in Canada. "I'm just trying to think of a way to do it where we kill
<b>Floyd</b> | everything in his house afterwards." He scrunches up his forehead and
<b>Floyd</b> | nose in mild, distracted thought.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, you know, as an experienced text gamer, I am trained in creative

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Come on, what makes you think Thornton will be able to slur seven

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I want you to imagine a cross between a puma and a panther." I have a
<b>Floyd</b> | documented problem visualizing genetic monstrosities, so I just nod.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Okay, this cat has gone forth and killed reams of livestock all across
<b>Floyd</b> | Canada. It throws down chickens like a pack of orange Tic-Tacs. It even
<b>Floyd</b> | eats the common predators up there, like, I dunno, mongooses and
<b>Floyd</b> | wolverines." I start to suspect that Scott is one of those guys who
<b>Floyd</b> | don't actually know a lot about the nation of Canada, like 1) Americans
<b>Floyd</b> | who think that Toronto is a quick drive from Calgary, and 2) the
<b>Floyd</b> | entirety of the Québécois. "The Beast is completely out of control, but
<b>Floyd</b> | nobody will do anything for two reasons. The first is the tax credit
<b>Floyd</b> | dispersed to the locals when half their stock goes missing, the second
<b>Floyd</b> | is because they all want to skull-fuck it."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He clears his throat. "Although the thing is described as a puma
<b>Floyd</b> | crossed with a panther, I don't think that does it justice. You might
<b>Floyd</b> | be thinking of a four-legged beast, or some odd amalgam of the two
<b>Floyd</b> | distinct beasts, if you're some kind of thick-browed goddamn sped. You
<b>Floyd</b> | have to eliminate that First World mindset."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm, of course, freezing my testicles off in a Saints jersey,
<b>Floyd</b> | undershirt, work boots, pince-nez and little else, involved in some
<b>Floyd</b> | kind of amateur poaching/arson operation that's being filmed for
<b>Floyd</b> | posterity. Aside from introducing some trouble with malaria and voting,
<b>Floyd</b> | I can't feel any less First World.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It's actually a woman, and it has a great body." Scott turns to look
<b>Floyd</b> | me in the eye for the first time since Edmonton. He searches for any
<b>Floyd</b> | trace that I might think this is some sort of anthropomorphic
<b>Floyd</b> | animal/fetish thing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Great rack," he continues. "Fangs, of course, but who isn't into that?
<b>Floyd</b> | Certainly not the kind of people that would live up here in this frozen
<b>Floyd</b> | wasteland. Sleek, athletic legs... and she kills prey for her food and
<b>Floyd</b> | all that. She's an unbelievably sexy creature of mythology, and we're
<b>Floyd</b> | going to get her on film when she's passed out at Thornton's."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Wait... you know that she's here? How? How do you know these things?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "How did I know that Don Woods killed a dragon with his bare hands and
<b>Floyd</b> | then blogged about it in Willie Crowther's FORTRAN game, dummy? I just
<b>Floyd</b> | do. We're going to get into Thornton's place under the guise of
<b>Floyd</b> | interviewing him and then scour his place once he passes out and his
<b>Floyd</b> | eyes are liquor-scented 'XXX's. We'll film the Beast of Exmoor and then
<b>Floyd</b> | burn the place to the ground, killing everyone inside." My heart skips
<b>Floyd</b> | a beat, as Thornton has a really nice Atari trackball on his MAME
<b>Floyd</b> | system. Maybe I've become as inhuman as everyone else in my life. Maybe
<b>Floyd</b> | I just love trackballs. Probably both.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He gives me the key so we can get in. I'm sure I'll lose it soon.

<b>Floyd</b> | Inside the House
<b>Floyd</b> |   We enter the house and Adam is waiting for us.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm Adam, good to meetcha," he says. He had actually met me twice
<b>Floyd</b> | before, but he's so booze-fueled, I doubt he'd be able to spell my name
<b>Floyd</b> | if I spotted him both 'B's. "Can I get you two something to drink?"
<b>Floyd</b> | Before we can even say anything, he's taken us to his second bathtub.
<b>Floyd</b> | "There are few rules here," he says. "Don't bathe in the second through
<b>Floyd</b> | sixth bathtub. Don't ask questions about what I'm brewing or have
<b>Floyd</b> | brewed in those bathtubs." He walks us out to the MAME cab. "Lastly,
<b>Floyd</b> | all these games are yours to play and set high scores on, except one,"
<b>Floyd</b> | he says.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Boon-ga Boon-ga?" I ask.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "What? No. Major Havoc. Don't fuck with it - I don't have my roller set
<b>Floyd</b> | right, and I don't want to go digging back there to reset the score if
<b>Floyd</b> | one of you degenerates gets a high score with the arrow keys." There
<b>Floyd</b> | aren't any arrow keys on a MAME cabinet, but I'm temporarily blind
<b>Floyd</b> | after smelling the bathtub concoction, and Scott's focused on looking
<b>Floyd</b> | for the Beast. I try to soak in some of the craftsmanship of the table:
<b>Floyd</b> | it's divided into four sections - each player gets his own joystick,
<b>Floyd</b> | six cherry microswitch buttons, a martini holder and a bolted-on
<b>Floyd</b> | cigarette tray.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Why don't you," whispers Scott, "distract him while I try to flush out
<b>Floyd</b> | the Beast." By the end of it he's not whispering any more, because he
<b>Floyd</b> | got a good glance at Thornton's eyeballs, which look like twin,
<b>Floyd</b> | bloodshot magnets of a like charge, both trying to escape his skull in
<b>Floyd</b> | opposite directions. "In fact," he says to me directly in front of
<b>Floyd</b> | Thornton, "Why don't you go into the other room with him while I look
<b>Floyd</b> | for the Beast so we can burn this place down."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "OK," I say.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "OK," says Thornton.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thornton takes me over to the MAME cab and wipes his chin with the back
<b>Floyd</b> | of his arm. He had somehow consumed a fifth of something in the brief
<b>Floyd</b> | seconds I was listening to Scott. "It'sh my pride and joy, you know,"
<b>Floyd</b> | he slurs. "It's the most important thing I have ever contributed to the
<b>Floyd</b> | world."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It's a quality machine, definitely," I say as I spin through the
<b>Floyd</b> | front-end software, looking for the one game he said I couldn't play. I
<b>Floyd</b> | need help.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "No, thish homebrew," he says while one of his knees gives out, and at
<b>Floyd</b> | first I think he means some text game he crammed into MAMEWah before
<b>Floyd</b> | realizing, no, he was talking booze-homebrew. "The cat-girl is good
<b>Floyd</b> | too," he says. I'm slightly surprised that he has any clue that there
<b>Floyd</b> | is a creature of myth reportedly hanging around his place.

<b>Floyd</b> | female seductress inside. It's like the show Max Headroom, if they put
<b>Floyd</b> | Amanda Pays in the TV instead. And she is, like, half-puma, too.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I need you to let me out. I'll do anything for you... I'd be so
<b>Floyd</b> | grateful." She starts to lick her lips and I see the sharpened
<b>Floyd</b> | incisors. Suddenly it's as if I had been drinking all the bathtub gin
<b>Floyd</b> | for the last ... well, I don't know how long Thornton has been
<b>Floyd</b> | continually drunk, let's just go with "the last forty years."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Did you find anything?" yells Scott from upstairs.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Let me tell you about this particular Mr. Do! level on here," I say in
<b>Floyd</b> | reply, knowing that no human being with a working brain stem will
<b>Floyd</b> | notice if I don't finish that sentence.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Open the coin door," she says, all sexy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I can't, though. "It's locked."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | That's all the opening the Beast needed. She wasn't actually in the
<b>Floyd</b> | MAME machine's monitor, it was just a combination of her reflection and
<b>Floyd</b> | my fucked-up vision, thanks to smelling all the homebrew. The Beast of
<b>Floyd</b> | Exmoor drives its fangs into the back of my neck, and I instantly make
<b>Floyd</b> | a mess out of my shorts. I slump down against the MAME machine,
<b>Floyd</b> | smearing blood all over it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Jason....!" I attempt to yell his name, to warn him.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "scott, scott," says the Beast, mimicking the Loud Room from Zork I,
<b>Floyd</b> | but kind of messing it up. I raise a finger to correct her, but am in
<b>Floyd</b> | such poor condition that my held possessions instead scatter around on
<b>Floyd</b> | the ground.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "My wife!" exclaims Thornton, as he bursts into tears. "My sweet, feral
<b>Floyd</b> | wife... why must you kill again, you know it drives me to drink..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Jason Scott comes flying down the stairs, equipment in tow, camera
<b>Floyd</b> | trained on the Beast. "You!" he bellows to Mrs. Thornton, the Beast of
<b>Floyd</b> | Exmoor. "You're, you're -- "
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Sated," she says, as she picks up the book of Frontalot matches from
<b>Floyd</b> | just beyond my reach and lights a cigarette. She blows out the match
<b>Floyd</b> | and discards it towards one of the hallways with a floor that is soaked
<b>Floyd</b> | with standing alcohol.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The match re-ignites during its graceful arc, and everything gets loud
<b>Floyd</b> | and orange.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "This is great footage," says Scott, with his eye into the camera. "I
<b>Floyd</b> | see you're awake. I only saved you because I'll need you to bribe the
<b>Floyd</b> | authorities when they get here. Of course, we're so deep into the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In your earliest memory of her the two of you are together on the

<b>Floyd</b> | don't know where your Mom is; over talking to one of the other moms,
<b>Floyd</b> | perhaps. All the other kids are climbing around on a towering metal
<b>Floyd</b> | jungle gym. The fall wind is brisk, and the metal is cold to the touch.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see her standing there, alone. Her blonde hair is in messy
<b>Floyd</b> | pigtails; her eyes, the bluest blue.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Wanna spin?" she asks, and without warning she throws her arms out
<b>Floyd</b> | like airplane wings and begins spinning in place. She tosses her head
<b>Floyd</b> | back and laughs and laughs. Her pigtails are parallel with her arms
<b>Floyd</b> | now.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A dozen rotations later she collapses in a dizzy pile, still giggling.

<b>Floyd</b> | My Bedroom
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The vinyl record on the record player continues to spin as the needle
<b>Floyd</b> | reaches the end of the track. The repeated clicking coming from the
<b>Floyd</b> | speakers indicates the song has ended.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Play another one," she says. Digging through the small pile of records
<b>Floyd</b> | on the floor, the choices are limited.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "We've already heard them all," you say to her, but she doesn't seem to
<b>Floyd</b> | care. "Which one do you want? I Love Rock and Roll? We Will Rock You?
<b>Floyd</b> | The Devil Went Down to Georgia?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "We Will Rock You!" she says. Carefully you lift the record player's
<b>Floyd</b> | arm, remove the last record, pop the yellow, spiral adapter into the
<b>Floyd</b> | middle of the next 45, and place "We Will Rock You" down on to your
<b>Floyd</b> | cheap, plastic turntable. After a moment of crackling, those familiar
<b>Floyd</b> | drums kick in. Boom Boom Clap. Boom Boom Clap.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As they do, She stands up and begins marching around the room, stomping
<b>Floyd</b> | and clapping. Stomp Stomp CLAP. Stomp Stomp CLAP. You follow her lead
<b>Floyd</b> | and soon the two of you are marching around your room in a circle.
<b>Floyd</b> | Stomp Stomp CLAP. Stomp Stomp CLAP! The two of you mumble your way
<b>Floyd</b> | through the verses, but really belt out the chorus.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "WE, WILL, WE, WILL, ROCK YOU!" the two of you shout.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When the guitar solo rolls around you pick up your tennis racket and
<b>Floyd</b> | nail the solo. Your fingers touch each string carefully and
<b>Floyd</b> | methodically as if you're actually playing the guitar. You hope she
<b>Floyd</b> | notices your attention to detail as you play the tennis racket more
<b>Floyd</b> | accurately than anyone ever has. As the song comes to an end the two of
<b>Floyd</b> | you collapse on my floor. Your leg brushes against hers. It feels nice.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The two of you continue to laugh, lying on your backs and staring at
<b>Floyd</b> | the ceiling. You're still holding that dumb tennis racket.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh my God, it's so hot here. Can you open your window?"

<b>Floyd</b> | The Mustang
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Mustang's window goes down as you crank the handle around in a
<b>Floyd</b> | circle. No power windows back then, not for a broke high school student
<b>Floyd</b> | such as yourself, anyway.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "How much further is it?" she asks.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It's right up here, right past this parking lot," you say -- at least
<b>Floyd</b> | you hope it is, never having actually been there before.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Right past the parking lot is an unlit dirt road. Recent rains have
<b>Floyd</b> | turned the dirt path into muddy ruts, and you weren't expecting it to
<b>Floyd</b> | be this bad. Before you know it, your wheels are spinning. You whip the
<b>Floyd</b> | steering wheel back and forth, but it's no use. You're stuck.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You turn the ignition off and get out of your car to assess the
<b>Floyd</b> | situation. "Listen," she says. "I can hear the falls!" Seeing your car
<b>Floyd</b> | stuck in six inches of mud has changed the mood, but there's nothing
<b>Floyd</b> | you can do about that now. You stare at the car, wondering how you're
<b>Floyd</b> | ever going to get it out of here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "C'mon!" she says, running up the dirt road. At the end of the road is
<b>Floyd</b> | a barbed-wire fence. You lift the top wire up and hold the bottom one
<b>Floyd</b> | down with your foot, allowing her to crawl through the opening. Once
<b>Floyd</b> | through she does the same for you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It's getting louder," she says excitedly, and she's right. You can now
<b>Floyd</b> | plainly hear the rushing water. As the two of you walk past the last
<b>Floyd</b> | row of trees, you can finally see it -- a giant, natural waterfall.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you step into the opening your foot slips on the wet grass and you
<b>Floyd</b> | hit the ground hard. "God DAMN it," you shout, which makes her laugh.
<b>Floyd</b> | Once the sting from the fall wears off you notice you're lying in a big
<b>Floyd</b> | muddy hole.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Still laughing, she plops down next to you and wipes the mud from your
<b>Floyd</b> | face. Then, without saying a word, she leans over and kisses you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You muster up all your courage. "Let's spend the night together," you
<b>Floyd</b> | say.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Let's spend the rest of our lives together," she says, and kisses you
<b>Floyd</b> | again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As soothing as the sound of the waterfall is, the rising sun finally
<b>Floyd</b> | wakes the two of you. Your car is exactly where you left it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "How about this," you suggest. "You get in the car and turn the wheels
<b>Floyd</b> | all the way to the right. I'll rock the car a bit to get things going.
<b>Floyd</b> | On the count of three, you hit the gas and shout "PUSH!" Then, I'll
<b>Floyd</b> | push. Sounds like a plan?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Sounds like a plan," she says, taking her spot inside the car. You
<b>Floyd</b> | begin to rock the car as the two of you count together. One ... two ...
<b>Floyd</b> | three ...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "PUSH!"

<b>Floyd</b> | The Hospital
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "PUSH!" screams the nurse, over your wife's cries. You grip her hand
<b>Floyd</b> | and squeeze. She squeezes back, ten times harder.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "There's the head," the doctor says, calmly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "One more push now, come on now," says the head nurse. "PUSH!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She does. Your wife's screams are followed by a moment of silence.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And then ... a cry. A crying baby.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It's a boy!" says the nurse. A boy. A son. My son.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Our son.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The nurses whisk him away for a moment to clean him up. As they wipe
<b>Floyd</b> | off the blood and count his fingers and toes, you take a moment to
<b>Floyd</b> | check on your wife.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Is he okay?" she asks.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "He's fine, just fine," you say. "You okay?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Eh," she says, before the tears well up in those blue eyes. "I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | okay," she says. "What happened to your shirt?" she asks. Confused, you
<b>Floyd</b> | look down -- there's a hole in your shirt surrounded by blood, but you
<b>Floyd</b> | aren't sure where it came from.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Huh, that's weird," you say. As you touch your shirt, a nurse taps you
<b>Floyd</b> | on your shoulder.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Would you like to hold your son now?" she says. He's so tiny, and
<b>Floyd</b> | looks ridiculous in his little matching blanket, hat and mittens.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Everybody's waiting outside," your wife says. "Go on out."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You walk out into the hallway and a dozen people run toward you to see
<b>Floyd</b> | your newborn son. Everybody is smiling and crying at the same time.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh, Dad," you say. "Grab my camera there and shoot a picture of me and
<b>Floyd</b> | the boy, will ya?" you say. He picks up the camera and points it at
<b>Floyd</b> | you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ready?" he asks.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Hold on," you say, as one of the baby's mittens is about to fall off.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Wait until I say "shoot". You wrestle the mitten the best you can back
<b>Floyd</b> | on to a baby who does not want to wear it. Whenever you're ready for
<b>Floyd</b> | him to take the picture, say "SHOOT".
