The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>One Eye Open</i>, written by Colin Sandel and Carolyn VanEseltine.  <I>One Eye Open</I> was originally released as part of the 2010 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took third place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/One_Eye_Open'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | One Eye Open
<b>Floyd</b> | An Interactive Nightmare by Colin Sandel and Carolyn VanEseltine
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 1 / Serial number 100929 / Inform 7 build 6E72 (I6/v6.31 lib
<b>Floyd</b> | 6/12N)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After only ten days, you're becoming surprisingly comfortable with
<b>Floyd</b> | life as a Corona Corporation guinea pig.  It helps that your routine
<b>Floyd</b> | is so reliable - meals, exercise, rest, and sleep are clearly arranged
<b>Floyd</b> | on a schedule hanging beside the white clock in your room.  As for the
<b>Floyd</b> | tests - well, you've grown used to the sight of your blood in a sample
<b>Floyd</b> | vial, and the rest is mostly paperwork.  Personality tests, aptitude
<b>Floyd</b> | tests, intelligence tests, psychological tests, Rorschach and the MMPI
<b>Floyd</b> | and even kinetic family drawing... you're starting to worry that
<b>Floyd</b> | they'll run out of tests by the end of the month.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Although 7:30 PM is always the day's last test, you never leave your
<b>Floyd</b> | room alone, so you were still watching American Beauty when Dr. Marnie
<b>Floyd</b> | Ephart knocked at the door.  "Oh, you're almost to the end!" she said
<b>Floyd</b> | brightly, seeing the screen.  "I can wait until you're through."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "No, that's fine."  You hit PAUSE to freeze Angela in mid-motion as
<b>Floyd</b> | you got up from the couch.  "I've seen it before."  Last Monday,
<b>Floyd</b> | actually.  The video collection isn't that good, and, considering what
<b>Floyd</b> | they're paying you, it's a pity Corona couldn't invest in a few more
<b>Floyd</b> | options.  It's hard to complain, though; the staff is friendly, the
<b>Floyd</b> | tests aren't hard, and the salary is great.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | During the day, Raymond, Best, or one of the scientists might be
<b>Floyd</b> | around, but at night, it's usually just the two of you, and the hall
<b>Floyd</b> | you cross now is deserted.  You accompany her through the antechamber
<b>Floyd</b> | and into the main testing chamber.  By now, you're used to being
<b>Floyd</b> | watched from behind one-way glass, but the observational room is fully
<b>Floyd</b> | lit today, and you can easily see inside.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Back in a moment," Dr. Ephart says cheerfully.  "See you on the other
<b>Floyd</b> | side!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Test Chamber, Corona Labs
<b>Floyd</b> | In the center of the room, a single black office chair sits in front
<b>Floyd</b> | of a broad, heavy desk.  The desk and chair are familiar, but the
<b>Floyd</b> | wireless keypad sitting on the desk is new.  There are five large
<b>Floyd</b> | white buttons on the keypad, each displaying a different symbol in
<b>Floyd</b> | broad black strokes.  The symbols are a circle, a cross, a set of
<b>Floyd</b> | three wavy lines, a square, and a five-pointed star.  As always, you
<b>Floyd</b> | are quite aware of the cameras watching you from above.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To the west, a windowless door separates the testing room from the
<b>Floyd</b> | antechamber outside.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The familiar black office chair sits invitingly nearby.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Through the thick pane of glass, you can see the curved desk in the
<b>Floyd</b> | observational room.

<b>Floyd</b> | sits down before pressing the intercom button.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "This is a different kind of test," Dr. Ephart explains.  "I have
<b>Floyd</b> | twenty-five cards here, each of which shows one of the symbols on your
<b>Floyd</b> | keypad."  She holds up five cards and fans them so you can see the
<b>Floyd</b> | circle, cross, wavy lines, square, and five-pointed star.  "I'm going
<b>Floyd</b> | to draw one of these cards and concentrate on the shape.  I want you
<b>Floyd</b> | to concentrate, to really focus your mind, and try to pick the same
<b>Floyd</b> | symbol that I do.  After you've decided on your symbol, press it on

<b>Floyd</b> |    I always considered my interest in the paranormal purely academic.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Well, things are clearly getting exciting for our guests from
<b>Floyd</b> | Corona Labs.
<b>Floyd</b> |    I'm not sure what's different, but I've heard signs of a struggle
<b>Floyd</b> | from McMoneagle's room during the day. Nurse Kim reports that his
<b>Floyd</b> | sleeping at night has been disruptive and suspects that his nightmares
<b>Floyd</b> | are more intense than when he first arrived. I want to know more, but
<b>Floyd</b> | obviously none of the Corona employees are telling me anything at all.
<b>Floyd</b> | As always, Cross watches me whenever I'm near their annex.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Something very suspicious is going on. They're experimenting on
<b>Floyd</b> | that young man, and it's obviously not anything safe. Be it on their
<b>Floyd</b> | heads if he dies, or becomes violent. They'd better be able to contain
<b>Floyd</b> | it, or we are going to come down on them as hard as the law allows. I
<b>Floyd</b> | swear it.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Yehuda has seemed the most concerned of the lot of them, and has
<b>Floyd</b> | mentioned to me that he may need to requisition "a few medications"
<b>Floyd</b> | from me in the near future. Truth be told, I hope he does so. That
<b>Floyd</b> | might give me some insight to just what in heaven's name they're

<b>Floyd</b> | 4/20/78
<b>Floyd</b> |  I knew it! I was right about him!
<b>Floyd</b> |  Ian is consistently testing better than any other subject we've put
<b>Floyd</b> | through the paces. His score with the Zener cards is consistently over
<b>Floyd</b> | 50% and he's shown some promise with psychometry. Dr. Atwater says
<b>Floyd</b> | that it's all within the limits of random chance, of course. That man
<b>Floyd</b> | would, presented with a UFO, write it off as a trendy new model of
<b>Floyd</b> | Chevette.
<b>Floyd</b> |  We still have some testing to do to determine Ian's psychological
<b>Floyd</b> | resilience and mental strength. There is some concern about his
<b>Floyd</b> | chronic nightmares and emotional difficulties, but I honestly think
<b>Floyd</b> | that one comes from the other. It's not uncommon for psychics to have
<b>Floyd</b> | problems like these.
<b>Floyd</b> |  If everything checks out, it should be about a week before he's
<b>Floyd</b> | introduced to the symbiont. I have a lot of faith, but it still makes

<b>Floyd</b> |  Ian is suffering a lot, and he says that his headaches are worse than

<b>Floyd</b> | be difficult for all of us until his mind adjusts to the symbiont. I'm

<b>Floyd</b> | them if it weren't a set part of our counseling sessions. He's very
<b>Floyd</b> | reluctant to talk about them, and refused to do so until I reminded
<b>Floyd</b> | him that failing to do so might hamper testing.
<b>Floyd</b> |  There's a common theme to his nighttime ordeals. Imagery involving
<b>Floyd</b> | teeth, internal organs, and being trapped in a moist, wet space are
<b>Floyd</b> | showing up over and over again. I've got to assume that Ian is
<b>Floyd</b> | obsessed with being eaten.
<b>Floyd</b> |  I can't help but wonder if he witnessed something awful when he was

<b>Floyd</b> | Raymond Pearce, M.D.
<b>Floyd</b> | Assistant Director, Mt. Airy Hospital
<b>Floyd</b> | May 8th, 1978
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  Well!
<b>Floyd</b> |    Dr. Yehuda has come to requisition supplies as he said he might,
<b>Floyd</b> | but I daresay I expected the man to be more composed when he did so.
<b>Floyd</b> |    He was wild-eyed when he came to my office, with the air of a
<b>Floyd</b> | fugitive who had just escaped a pursuer. It was therefore somewhat
<b>Floyd</b> | less of a surprise when he asked that I not report the requisition to
<b>Floyd</b> | Mr. Cross. Much as I would have liked to use the information as a
<b>Floyd</b> | bargaining chip, I am inclined to be more lenient to Dr. Yehuda as
<b>Floyd</b> | opposed to Cross, not to mention the fact that any requisition at all
<b>Floyd</b> | would give me information that I didn't have before.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Though suspicious, I therefore consented.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Dr. Yehuda asked for a dose of liquid tyramine for synthesis, as
<b>Floyd</b> | well as a drug that contained diazepam, benzodiazepenes, and beta
<b>Floyd</b> | blockers. Concerning the tyramine, I knew that the hospital had only
<b>Floyd</b> | one supply of the stuff suitable for the lab, and that went by the
<b>Floyd</b> | brand name Vanemine. We also had a cocktail matching the doctor's
<b>Floyd</b> | second request, which sold under the brand name Sandepam. I assured
<b>Floyd</b> | him that both would be made available to him.
<b>Floyd</b> |    As soon as I was clear of the Doctor, I began researching his
<b>Floyd</b> | choices, starting with the most specific and targeted. Given its
<b>Floyd</b> | specific chemical cocktail, Sandepam is primarily kept as a treatment
<b>Floyd</b> | for a potentially fatal adrenergic storm. While there are a lot of
<b>Floyd</b> | causes of such a condition, an overdose of tyramine is one. I can
<b>Floyd</b> | assume, then, that the relationship between the drugs is causal. So
<b>Floyd</b> | why would he need tyramine in the first place? I have trouble
<b>Floyd</b> | believing that Corona has hired out an annex to research some kind of
<b>Floyd</b> | advanced "cheese effect."
<b>Floyd</b> |    Given the secretive and dangerous air about the project combined
<b>Floyd</b> | with a need for high levels of a potentially life-threatening
<b>Floyd</b> | norepinephrine, I can only assume that they are playing with
<b>Floyd</b> | McMoneagle's brain. Are they trying to create a supersoldier? An
<b>Floyd</b> | advanced neurotoxin?
<b>Floyd</b> |    This is too dangerous. I've got to get to the bottom of it, even if
<b>Floyd</b> | it puts my position in danger.

<b>Floyd</b> | Alice's Diary, 4/17/78
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |  I know it's totally unprofessional, but I can't help but think that
<b>Floyd</b> | the patient in room 320 is really interesting.
<b>Floyd</b> |  I don't know much about him. He's in an annex that's being used by an
<b>Floyd</b> | outside corporation for a secret project or something. I'm not even
<b>Floyd</b> | really supposed to talk to him, but ...
<b>Floyd</b> |  Well, he looks so sad. He hasn't gone home in a week and a half and
<b>Floyd</b> | he'll be here for even longer than that, and he's got to be really
<b>Floyd</b> | lonely. They can't expect me to come through the room and give him
<b>Floyd</b> | food and change his linens and keep my mouth clamped shut the whole
<b>Floyd</b> | time. That's not fair to him and it's not fair to me either.
<b>Floyd</b> |  More than food and linens and medication, what a patient like that
<b>Floyd</b> | needs right now is a friendly face and light conversation if he
<b>Floyd</b> | happens to be up late. That's not a crime, is it?
<b>Floyd</b> |  And I've gotta admit ... he's kind of cute.

<b>Floyd</b> | Unofficial log, April 15, 11:00 am
<b>Floyd</b> |    I suppose someone must have listened to Elaine's assertion that
<b>Floyd</b> | this test subject was different from the rest, since we've just gained
<b>Floyd</b> | a new member of the team.
<b>Floyd</b> |    This was not a pleasant cup of chicory to down first thing in the
<b>Floyd</b> | morning. Don't get me wrong -- I would love, more than anything, to
<b>Floyd</b> | welcome Simon Cross to our ranks, and G-d knows that we could stand to
<b>Floyd</b> | gain another team member. Of all of the positions we had open prior to
<b>Floyd</b> | today, however, I'm not sure I ever would have counted "Company Spook"
<b>Floyd</b> | among them.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Perhaps I am being unfair, but it is my opinion that hypnotizing
<b>Floyd</b> | yourself into believing that a knife is a rolling pin will not prevent
<b>Floyd</b> | you from needing stitches after trying to make bread dough. Cross's
<b>Floyd</b> | official title is "auditor." He claims that he is here to oversee

<b>Floyd</b> | one bit. Cross oozes "professional interests." He brushes his teeth
<b>Floyd</b> | with it, or he wouldn't be able to give me that sharkish grin.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Still, we are bedfellows now. There's nothing to do but see to it
<b>Floyd</b> | that he is comfortable ... and bored.

<b>Floyd</b> | Unofficial log, May 6th, 8:00pm
<b>Floyd</b> |    Ian's test was strange today.
<b>Floyd</b> |    As I've said in my notes, Ian is showing a great deal of promise in
<b>Floyd</b> | remote viewing. He's able to come up with at least one salient, unique
<b>Floyd</b> | detail about anything he is asked to see.  Over the past day or two,
<b>Floyd</b> | his "scrying" has been strikingly accurate, including not only
<b>Floyd</b> | corroborating details but also an understanding of the situations he
<b>Floyd</b> | has been asked to view.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Today's trial, though, has left me with a nasty sense of
<b>Floyd</b> | foreboding.  Dr. Atwater had just excused himself to make a run to the
<b>Floyd</b> | convenience store, so I proposed to Ian that he perform a viewing on
<b>Floyd</b> | the doctor.  I was initially merely disappointed when Ian described an
<b>Floyd</b> | office within the facility, indicating guesswork on Ian's part.  After
<b>Floyd</b> | that, the boy became seriously agitated, babbling about being in
<b>Floyd</b> | danger.  He dissolved into a panic attack and spoke very fast. It was
<b>Floyd</b> | hard to understand him, but he seemed to be saying that Cross and Dr.
<b>Floyd</b> | Atwater were "out to get him," claiming that "they want to terminate
<b>Floyd</b> | me."
<b>Floyd</b> |    I did my best to placate the poor boy, but he was having none of
<b>Floyd</b> | it.  By the look in his eyes, he seemed to be caught in the vision and
<b>Floyd</b> | unable to escape it.  After a few minutes, I saw no recourse but to
<b>Floyd</b> | tranquilize him and have him moved back to his room under supervision.
<b>Floyd</b> | Once awake, he was very paranoid, still believing firmly that Cross
<b>Floyd</b> | and Dr. Atwater were conspiring to end his life.  By my estimation,
<b>Floyd</b> | this must have been his nightmares bleeding over into his visions,
<b>Floyd</b> | tainting them with the paranoia of being chased on a nightly basis.
<b>Floyd</b> | It's possible that Ian's abilities interpreted Dr. Atwater's departure
<b>Floyd</b> | from the facility as abandonment, termination. It's the best that I
<b>Floyd</b> | can guess.
<b>Floyd</b> |    There is a part of me that believes that I should have put all of
<b>Floyd</b> | this into the official report.  Instead, I used the most generic terms
<b>Floyd</b> | I could.  Panic attack.  Adverse effects.  Unexpected delusions.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Why not the truth, Theo?  You are a Doctor and an employee of
<b>Floyd</b> | Corona.  They don't pay you to omit details.
<b>Floyd</b> |    The truth is ... by now, I trust Ian's abilities more than I trust
<b>Floyd</b> | Dr. Atwater's belief in the project.  When Ian told me that Dr.
<b>Floyd</b> | Atwater wanted him to die, well, it was very difficult not to believe
<b>Floyd</b> | him.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Where is this project going, and why are we in a handbasket?
<b>Floyd</b> |    - Theo Yehuda

<b>Floyd</b> | of the morgue is lined with large drawers for corpse storage, like a

<b>Floyd</b> | a large industrial sink.  Nearby, a hospital gurney squats at an odd
<b>Floyd</b> | angle, one of its wheels bent sharply to the side. There is a spatter
<b>Floyd</b> | of dried blood on the drawers, marring the otherwise spartan
<b>Floyd</b> | cleanliness of the area.  The doors beneath the large counter stand

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A heavy glass door to the west leads back to the autopsy room.

<b>Floyd</b> | Unofficial log, April 15, 11:00 am
<b>Floyd</b> |    I suppose someone must have listened to Elaine's assertion that
<b>Floyd</b> | this test subject was different from the rest, since we've just gained
<b>Floyd</b> | a new member of the team.
<b>Floyd</b> |    This was not a pleasant cup of chicory to down first thing in the
<b>Floyd</b> | morning. Don't get me wrong -- I would love, more than anything, to
<b>Floyd</b> | welcome Simon Cross to our ranks, and G-d knows that we could stand to
<b>Floyd</b> | gain another team member. Of all of the positions we had open prior to
<b>Floyd</b> | today, however, I'm not sure I ever would have counted "Company Spook"
<b>Floyd</b> | among them.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Perhaps I am being unfair, but it is my opinion that hypnotizing
<b>Floyd</b> | yourself into believing that a knife is a rolling pin will not prevent
<b>Floyd</b> | you from needing stitches after trying to make bread dough. Cross's
<b>Floyd</b> | official title is "auditor." He claims that he is here to oversee
<b>Floyd</b> | Corona's professional interests in the Project, and I don't doubt him
<b>Floyd</b> | one bit. Cross oozes "professional interests." He brushes his teeth
<b>Floyd</b> | with it, or he wouldn't be able to give me that sharkish grin.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Still, we are bedfellows now. There's nothing to do but see to it
<b>Floyd</b> | that he is comfortable ... and bored.

<b>Floyd</b> | One Eye Open
<b>Floyd</b> | An Interactive Nightmare by Colin Sandel and Carolyn VanEseltine
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 1 / Serial number 100929 / Inform 7 build 6E72 (I6/v6.31 lib
<b>Floyd</b> | 6/12N)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After only ten days, you're becoming surprisingly comfortable with
<b>Floyd</b> | life as a Corona Corporation guinea pig.  It helps that your routine
<b>Floyd</b> | is so reliable - meals, exercise, rest, and sleep are clearly arranged
<b>Floyd</b> | on a schedule hanging beside the white clock in your room.  As for the
<b>Floyd</b> | tests - well, you've grown used to the sight of your blood in a sample
<b>Floyd</b> | vial, and the rest is mostly paperwork.  Personality tests, aptitude
<b>Floyd</b> | tests, intelligence tests, psychological tests, Rorschach and the MMPI
<b>Floyd</b> | and even kinetic family drawing... you're starting to worry that
<b>Floyd</b> | they'll run out of tests by the end of the month.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Although 7:30 PM is always the day's last test, you never leave your
<b>Floyd</b> | room alone, so you were still watching American Beauty when Dr. Marnie
<b>Floyd</b> | Ephart knocked at the door.  "Oh, you're almost to the end!" she said
<b>Floyd</b> | brightly, seeing the screen.  "I can wait until you're through."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "No, that's fine."  You hit PAUSE to freeze Angela in mid-motion as
<b>Floyd</b> | you got up from the couch.  "I've seen it before."  Last Monday,
<b>Floyd</b> | actually.  The video collection isn't that good, and, considering what
<b>Floyd</b> | they're paying you, it's a pity Corona couldn't invest in a few more
<b>Floyd</b> | options.  It's hard to complain, though; the staff is friendly, the
<b>Floyd</b> | tests aren't hard, and the salary is great.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | During the day, Raymond, Best, or one of the scientists might be
<b>Floyd</b> | around, but at night, it's usually just the two of you, and the hall
<b>Floyd</b> | you cross now is deserted.  You accompany her through the antechamber
<b>Floyd</b> | and into the main testing chamber.  By now, you're used to being
<b>Floyd</b> | watched from behind one-way glass, but the observational room is fully
<b>Floyd</b> | lit today, and you can easily see inside.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Back in a moment," Dr. Ephart says cheerfully.  "See you on the other
<b>Floyd</b> | side!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Test Chamber, Corona Labs
<b>Floyd</b> | In the center of the room, a single black office chair sits in front
<b>Floyd</b> | of a broad, heavy desk.  The desk and chair are familiar, but the
<b>Floyd</b> | wireless keypad sitting on the desk is new.  There are five large
<b>Floyd</b> | white buttons on the keypad, each displaying a different symbol in
<b>Floyd</b> | broad black strokes.  The symbols are a circle, a cross, a set of
<b>Floyd</b> | three wavy lines, a square, and a five-pointed star.  As always, you
<b>Floyd</b> | are quite aware of the cameras watching you from above.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To the west, a windowless door separates the testing room from the
<b>Floyd</b> | antechamber outside.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The familiar black office chair sits invitingly nearby.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Through the thick pane of glass, you can see the curved desk in the
<b>Floyd</b> | observational room.

<b>Floyd</b> | Unofficial log, May 11th, 11:30 am
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    I can't believe that I didn't do more digging when I first signed
<b>Floyd</b> | on with this G-d damned company. A little bit of snooping would have
<b>Floyd</b> | saved me a world of horror.  While I knew that Ian was not the first
<b>Floyd</b> | subject of Corona's experiments, what I did not know was exactly how
<b>Floyd</b> | the others had been deemed unsuitable.  I wonder if "Reacted poorly to
<b>Floyd</b> | the symbiont" managed to make it onto their epitaphs, or whether it
<b>Floyd</b> | was scrawled in the margins of a toe tag.  Knowing what I have learned
<b>Floyd</b> | about Corona, I would be surprised if they lent even that much dignity
<b>Floyd</b> | to their "lab rats."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    The cherry on the proverbial sundae: their very best metric of
<b>Floyd</b> | success, the sign that they are on the right track: the death of a
<b>Floyd</b> | researcher at the hands of a psychic test subject, purposefully hopped
<b>Floyd</b> | up on a potentially fatal brain-eating symbiont.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    This has to stop.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    I am working on an inoculation against the symbiont.  The fact that
<b>Floyd</b> | Ian survived it is a good sign that his own psychic ability might be
<b>Floyd</b> | enough to withstand its death. The theory is as follows:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    I need a sample of the symbiont, dead, just as for a standard
<b>Floyd</b> | vaccine.  This should be easy; Atwater indicated to me in April that
<b>Floyd</b> | the symbiont died in response to standard chemicals, so long as it
<b>Floyd</b> | wasn't already in a living being's system.  A dose of the vaccine
<b>Floyd</b> | would be enough to kill the symbiont itself, but its bond with Ian's
<b>Floyd</b> | mind will be harder to break.  With this in mind, a very strong dose
<b>Floyd</b> | of tyramine will give him the adrenal spike he needs to break that
<b>Floyd</b> | psychic link.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    He'll need almost immediately to take a strong dose of medicine to
<b>Floyd</b> | stave off an adrenergic storm; that amount of tyramine would be fatal
<b>Floyd</b> | to anyone, even a psychic of his stature.  With that in mind, I have
<b>Floyd</b> | requisitioned a drug with enough levels of diazepam, benzodiazepenes
<b>Floyd</b> | and beta blockers.  If he takes them in turn, it'll be hell on his
<b>Floyd</b> | system ... but he will live and the symbiont won't.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    I have the diazepam formula. I just hope I can get ahold of the
<b>Floyd</b> | tyramine-fortified vaccine before that spook, Cross, realizes what I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | up to.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    - Theo Yehuda
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Below, you find a recipe detailing the creation of a vaccine.  It
<b>Floyd</b> | requires a sample of contaminated blood, "Vnmne", formaldehyde, and
<b>Floyd</b> | "Hrtmn for dilut", all combined in precise measurements and directly
<b>Floyd</b> | injected into the subject.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | No wonder Dr. Yehuda preferred to type his notes - his handwriting was
<b>Floyd</b> | abysmal.

<b>Floyd</b> | April 3rd, 1978

<b>Floyd</b> | Corona is to throw their money away. Such tremendous cost of research!
<b>Floyd</b> | Such lucrative pay for the staff! Such reparations to the families of
<b>Floyd</b> | the dead!
<b>Floyd</b> |    This project has killed fifteen fools who believed themselves to be

<b>Floyd</b> | tests, psychological profiles. They would pass muster or fail, and
<b>Floyd</b> | those who failed would be turned away. The poor fools who pass receive

<b>Floyd</b> | died thanks to the "symbiont."
<b>Floyd</b> |    Symbiont. Pah. I'm no microbiologist, but I recognize the symptoms
<b>Floyd</b> | of a parasite when I see one, and this one has killed everyone that
<b>Floyd</b> | it's been fed to. The thing dies like any other microorganism when
<b>Floyd</b> | exposed to formaldehyde in the lab as when creating a vaccine, but

<b>Floyd</b> |    I don't know what kind of disaster they've uncovered but it's
<b>Floyd</b> | happening right now and it's in my hospital.
<b>Floyd</b> |    They're all running around like they're possessed. The subject,

<b>Floyd</b> | energy than I've ever seen him display. He went down the stairs, not a
<b>Floyd</b> | doctor or escort in sight. I should have followed, but something gave
<b>Floyd</b> | me this unearthly fear. Ridiculous, but it's hard not to fall prey to
<b>Floyd</b> | the mysticism that's surrounded this whole absurd affair.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Minutes later, I heard screaming, like the kind in the giant
<b>Floyd</b> | monster pictures my nephew is so damn fond of. I couldn't tell where
<b>Floyd</b> | it was from. Now there's something strange going on in the wet lab,
<b>Floyd</b> | something obscuring the window in there.
<b>Floyd</b> |    It's now or never. I have a terrible feeling about all this, but I

<b>Floyd</b> | Alice's Diary, 5/6/78
<b>Floyd</b> |  Today must have been different for Ian. When I came in, he greeted me
<b>Floyd</b> | with a plea to keep him company and keep him awake. I was glad to be
<b>Floyd</b> | able to help, so we talked late into the night.
<b>Floyd</b> |  It feels like he's putting a lot of trust in me, even though he
<b>Floyd</b> | doesn't like to talk about his nightmares or his past. He seems to be
<b>Floyd</b> | afraid of himself, and said over and over that he didn't want to hurt
<b>Floyd</b> | anybody. He's afraid, he says, and he doesn't want to hurt anybody. It
<b>Floyd</b> | was hard not to laugh at the notion of Ian hurting anybody. He
<b>Floyd</b> | wouldn't -- couldn't -- hurt a fly.
<b>Floyd</b> |  He really didn't want to fall asleep, but eventually he just couldn't
<b>Floyd</b> | stay up any longer. I tucked him in and tried to make him as
<b>Floyd</b> | comfortable as I could for when the nightmares came.
<b>Floyd</b> |  I think I'm developing feelings for Ian. His eyes are so expressive
<b>Floyd</b> | and he feels for other people so keenly. Unprofessional or not, Ian's
<b>Floyd</b> | a really special person and I hope Corona's able to cure him of
<b>Floyd</b> | whatever it is that he's got. I wish I could do something for him.

<b>Floyd</b> |    This was not a pleasant cup of chicory to down first thing in the

<b>Floyd</b> | gain another team member. Of all of the positions we had open prior to
<b>Floyd</b> | today, however, I'm not sure I ever would have counted "Company Spook"
<b>Floyd</b> | among them.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Perhaps I am being unfair, but it is my opinion that hypnotizing

<b>Floyd</b> | official title is "auditor." He claims that he is here to oversee

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And with the name comes identity:

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your awareness doubles - you remember drinking tea with Dr. Ephart
<b>Floyd</b> | after signing your guinea pig contract, but there's an echo in your
<b>Floyd</b> | mind, the echo of tens or hundreds of other snacks and meals grabbed
<b>Floyd</b> | quickly in this room, either alone or with others.  These thoughts
<b>Floyd</b> | aren't yours, but they strike and dissolve upon your own thoughts like
<b>Floyd</b> | falling raindrops, shifting them subtly with every touch.  Grasping
<b>Floyd</b> | for inner purchase, you come up with a name:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Abeni - no, Elizabeth, Elizabeth "Best" - Ife.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And with the name comes identity:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I said my name was Elizabeth, and they called me Betsy, then Bets.
<b>Floyd</b> | When Marlene's kid garbled it to Best, I kept it - that was perfect!
<b>Floyd</b> | I'll be the best they've ever seen.  A lab tech now, but that's just

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Her thoughts are inflicted strangely - there's a lilt to them, a sway.

<b>Floyd</b> | own copy.  It's called Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!  For a
<b>Floyd</b> | physicist, Richard Feynman got up to some absolutely crazy shit -
<b>Floyd</b> | playing the bongos, going to Japan and Brazil, sending puzzle letters
<b>Floyd</b> | with his wife to dodge the government censors, and so on.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You even had the chance to try out one of his stunts.  After reading
<b>Floyd</b> | about how he cracked all the locks at Los Alamos, you went wandering
<b>Floyd</b> | around the building in search of locks to try his techniques on, and
<b>Floyd</b> | you went into a whole bunch of filing cabinets with no one the wiser.
<b>Floyd</b> | You also found this great old desk hidden in the basement with a safe
<b>Floyd</b> | bolted onto it.  That was totally weird!  You managed to get it open,
<b>Floyd</b> | and there were even some papers inside....
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | That's been bothering you, a bit - because the papers in there were
<b>Floyd</b> | old, but they talked about a set of experiments that sounded very
<b>Floyd</b> | familiar.  There's no way anyone else could know about Naegleria
<b>Floyd</b> | splendens, is there?  You passed them over to Dr. Ephart - she'll
<b>Floyd</b> | figure out what to do from here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Where is your mind going?  You must need that espresso very badly!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Something inside you (not Best, but you) snaps shut like a clamshell,
<b>Floyd</b> | preserving that moment and that memory.  It might be important....

<b>Floyd</b> | Only a single object dares to split the room: a wall-mounted

<b>Floyd</b> | Mr. Schuyler was right; there is entirely too much humanity in this
<b>Floyd</b> | project.
<b>Floyd</b> | Only Atwater displays even the remotest scrap of professional
<b>Floyd</b> | detachment, which he manages to keep entirely useless through the
<b>Floyd</b> | judicious application of insecurity and megalomania. Yehuda, while

<b>Floyd</b> | matter how much faith Mr. Schuyler has in her abilities, is little
<b>Floyd</b> | more than a hippie who lacked the good graces to be born in the
<b>Floyd</b> | correct decade.
<b>Floyd</b> | I have no doubt that my presence has their dander up. I will never be
<b>Floyd</b> | able to oil my smile so much that it would not arouse their collective
<b>Floyd</b> | suspicion. But that's of no consequence. They know their jobs, shaken
<b>Floyd</b> | nerves will not deter them, and this is precisely as it should be.

<b>Floyd</b> | S.C. - Entry 1978-05-07-0400
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "No battle plan survives contact with the enemy."
<b>Floyd</b> | Atwater spoke to me about the possibility of terminating McMoneagle.
<b>Floyd</b> | It is true and observable that Ian has suffered more severe effects
<b>Floyd</b> | than any of the previous test recipients had before their brains
<b>Floyd</b> | succumbed to the symbiont's side effects. Since Atwater has never had
<b>Floyd</b> | faith in the possible success of the project, psychotic reactions hold
<b>Floyd</b> | no hope for him. He would just as soon destroy the subject and move to
<b>Floyd</b> | the next.
<b>Floyd</b> | What I did not know upon this meeting is that Atwater had given an
<b>Floyd</b> | innocuous excuse to Yehuda concerning his absence from the test -- a
<b>Floyd</b> | trip to the store. This rendered him an adequate target for a remote
<b>Floyd</b> | viewing session, by Yehuda's reckoning. Ian "overheard" Atwater's
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation with me and became overwrought.
<b>Floyd</b> | When he went to sleep, his psychic abilities manifested, somehow
<b>Floyd</b> | dealing severe trauma to Atwater's heart. By the time the doctor was
<b>Floyd</b> | taken to the hospital, he was already dead.
<b>Floyd</b> | While I was notified almost immediately, this is going to be
<b>Floyd</b> | incredibly inconvenient to keep quiet and controlled. Elaine should be
<b>Floyd</b> | easy to manipulate; her faith in the project will ensure her loyalty.
<b>Floyd</b> | Yehuda will be another matter. I will speak to him directly, but even
<b>Floyd</b> | then I will need to keep an eye on the man. He has too much humanity
<b>Floyd</b> | to be a good Doctor.
<b>Floyd</b> | I realize that it is my job to babysit the ignorant, but that does not

<b>Floyd</b> | With a satisfying clatter, six dice bounce across the surface of the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "No, John, let me tell YOU something," he says. "The Schuyler family

<b>Floyd</b> | stuff is the real deal, and whoever pulls it off first is going to be
<b>Floyd</b> | set for generations."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He grabs three of the dice, leaving the three that show sixes.  With
<b>Floyd</b> | an offhand gesture, he tosses them again.  One of the three comes up a
<b>Floyd</b> | six.  "Look, this Buchanan broad is too hippy dippy for the Institute,
<b>Floyd</b> | but she's the real deal and she'll do anything for a break.  They want
<b>Floyd</b> | to look legit, fine, but they won't land the project.  We will."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He picks up one of the unlucky dice, then the other.  He pauses for a
<b>Floyd</b> | moment, listening to the phone, then laughs.  "Well, John, I imagine
<b>Floyd</b> | she'll go nuts after a little while, but if you're not willing to
<b>Floyd</b> | squeeze an orange hard enough, you'll never get a glass of juice.
<b>Floyd</b> | Well, all right John.  Talk to you later."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The man hangs up the phone, then throws the final two dice one last
<b>Floyd</b> | time.  Both come up sixes.  He leans back in his chair and smiles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Heh-heh," he says. "Yahtzee."

<b>Floyd</b> | You smile quietly.  You're seeing things differently too, now, and so

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Ian McMoneagle looks you in the face with wide, terrified eyes, his

<b>Floyd</b> | One Eye Open
<b>Floyd</b> | An Interactive Nightmare by Colin Sandel and Carolyn VanEseltine
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 1 / Serial number 100929 / Inform 7 build 6E72 (I6/v6.31 lib
<b>Floyd</b> | 6/12N)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After only ten days, you're becoming surprisingly comfortable with
<b>Floyd</b> | life as a Corona Corporation guinea pig.  It helps that your routine
<b>Floyd</b> | is so reliable - meals, exercise, rest, and sleep are clearly arranged
<b>Floyd</b> | on a schedule hanging beside the white clock in your room.  As for the
<b>Floyd</b> | tests - well, you've grown used to the sight of your blood in a sample
<b>Floyd</b> | vial, and the rest is mostly paperwork.  Personality tests, aptitude
<b>Floyd</b> | tests, intelligence tests, psychological tests, Rorschach and the MMPI
<b>Floyd</b> | and even kinetic family drawing... you're starting to worry that
<b>Floyd</b> | they'll run out of tests by the end of the month.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Although 7:30 PM is always the day's last test, you never leave your
<b>Floyd</b> | room alone, so you were still watching American Beauty when Dr. Marnie
<b>Floyd</b> | Ephart knocked at the door.  "Oh, you're almost to the end!" she said
<b>Floyd</b> | brightly, seeing the screen.  "I can wait until you're through."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "No, that's fine."  You hit PAUSE to freeze Angela in mid-motion as
<b>Floyd</b> | you got up from the couch.  "I've seen it before."  Last Monday,
<b>Floyd</b> | actually.  The video collection isn't that good, and, considering what
<b>Floyd</b> | they're paying you, it's a pity Corona couldn't invest in a few more
<b>Floyd</b> | options.  It's hard to complain, though; the staff is friendly, the
<b>Floyd</b> | tests aren't hard, and the salary is great.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | During the day, Raymond, Best, or one of the scientists might be
<b>Floyd</b> | around, but at night, it's usually just the two of you, and the hall
<b>Floyd</b> | you cross now is deserted.  You accompany her through the antechamber
<b>Floyd</b> | and into the main testing chamber.  By now, you're used to being
<b>Floyd</b> | watched from behind one-way glass, but the observational room is fully
<b>Floyd</b> | lit today, and you can easily see inside.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Back in a moment," Dr. Ephart says cheerfully.  "See you on the other
<b>Floyd</b> | side!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Test Chamber, Corona Labs
<b>Floyd</b> | In the center of the room, a single black office chair sits in front
<b>Floyd</b> | of a broad, heavy desk.  The desk and chair are familiar, but the
<b>Floyd</b> | wireless keypad sitting on the desk is new.  There are five large
<b>Floyd</b> | white buttons on the keypad, each displaying a different symbol in
<b>Floyd</b> | broad black strokes.  The symbols are a circle, a cross, a set of
<b>Floyd</b> | three wavy lines, a square, and a five-pointed star.  As always, you
<b>Floyd</b> | are quite aware of the cameras watching you from above.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To the west, a windowless door separates the testing room from the
<b>Floyd</b> | antechamber outside.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The familiar black office chair sits invitingly nearby.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Through the thick pane of glass, you can see the curved desk in the
<b>Floyd</b> | observational room.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | &gt;That was a rhetorical question.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Through the thick pane of glass, you see Dr. Ephart come into the
<b>Floyd</b> | observational room carrying a stack of cards and a notebook.  She
<b>Floyd</b> | waves to you in friendly fashion, sets her notebook on the desk, and
<b>Floyd</b> | sits down before pressing the intercom button.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "This is a different kind of test," Dr. Ephart explains.  "I have
<b>Floyd</b> | twenty-five cards here, each of which shows one of the symbols on your
<b>Floyd</b> | keypad."  She holds up five cards and fans them so you can see the
<b>Floyd</b> | circle, cross, wavy lines, square, and five-pointed star.  "I'm going
<b>Floyd</b> | to draw one of these cards and concentrate on the shape.  I want you
<b>Floyd</b> | to concentrate, to really focus your mind, and try to pick the same
<b>Floyd</b> | symbol that I do.  After you've decided on your symbol, press it on
<b>Floyd</b> | the keypad.  We'll do five of these."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Dr. Ephart shuffles her cards together and draws the first card.  She
<b>Floyd</b> | holds the card up with its back to you.

<b>Floyd</b> | Your last visit to this room was your last breath of normalcy; now,

<b>Floyd</b> | viscera lies in a wide cone, sprayed toward the door through which you
<b>Floyd</b> | entered.  Blood drips from the walls and ceiling in the shape of that
<b>Floyd</b> | same cone, pelting you with a gentle crimson rain.  The most complete
<b>Floyd</b> | part of the remains is a single high-heeled shoe, which lies just in
<b>Floyd</b> | front of the pile.  The ficus tree that previously stood in the corner
<b>Floyd</b> | now lies on its side, its leaves glistening with blood.  Its pot, now
<b>Floyd</b> | cracked, lies on its side in a pile of blood-drenched topsoil.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The screaming from inside the test chamber hammers down, not only on

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Test Chamber, Mt Airy Hospital
<b>Floyd</b> | While you are not entirely sure what you expected to find, you are
<b>Floyd</b> | halted in your tracks nonetheless.  The floor of the test chamber is
<b>Floyd</b> | littered with glittering shards of reflective glass.  The one-way
<b>Floyd</b> | mirror between the test chamber and the observation room is opaque,
<b>Floyd</b> | but it pushes outward in the center to form a pair of jagged,
<b>Floyd</b> | irregular halves like a pair of jaws.  From the hips up, Ian
<b>Floyd</b> | McMoneagle is trapped in the grip of those jaws, his face twisted into
<b>Floyd</b> | a mask of pain.  The mirror's halves grind against muscle and bone,
<b>Floyd</b> | tearing him apart as they draw him in.  And yet he lives....
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Ian McMoneagle looks you in the face with wide, terrified eyes, his
<b>Floyd</b> | bloody bangs obscuring his gaze but not reducing its weight.  He opens
<b>Floyd</b> | his mouth and screams in guilty agony.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The mirror pulls Ian in more deeply.  The hideous cracking sound that
<b>Floyd</b> | follows is almost surely his pelvis.

<b>Floyd</b> | A darkened office. The orange light of dusk spilling through venetian
<b>Floyd</b> | blinds, laying bright stripes on the dark wood of an expensive luxury
<b>Floyd</b> | desk.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With a satisfying clatter, six dice bounce across the surface of the
<b>Floyd</b> | desk, coming to rest with assorted results: 6 6 2 6 3 1.  The man who
<b>Floyd</b> | threw them, a middle-aged man with a face craggier than his age should
<b>Floyd</b> | allow, wears Brylcreemed black hair, a power suit, and the receiver of
<b>Floyd</b> | an office telephone held firmly to the side of his head.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "No, John, let me tell YOU something," he says. "The Schuyler family
<b>Floyd</b> | didn't get to be where it is because we refused to take risks.  This
<b>Floyd</b> | stuff is the real deal, and whoever pulls it off first is going to be
<b>Floyd</b> | set for generations."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He grabs three of the dice, leaving the three that show sixes.  With
<b>Floyd</b> | an offhand gesture, he tosses them again.  One of the three comes up a
<b>Floyd</b> | six.  "Look, this Buchanan broad is too hippy dippy for the Institute,
<b>Floyd</b> | but she's the real deal and she'll do anything for a break.  They want
<b>Floyd</b> | to look legit, fine, but they won't land the project.  We will."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He picks up one of the unlucky dice, then the other.  He pauses for a
<b>Floyd</b> | moment, listening to the phone, then laughs.  "Well, John, I imagine
<b>Floyd</b> | she'll go nuts after a little while, but if you're not willing to
<b>Floyd</b> | squeeze an orange hard enough, you'll never get a glass of juice.
<b>Floyd</b> | Well, all right John.  Talk to you later."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The man hangs up the phone, then throws the final two dice one last
<b>Floyd</b> | time.  Both come up sixes.  He leans back in his chair and smiles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Heh-heh," he says. "Yahtzee."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then, he puts five dice back in the game box and one die in his
