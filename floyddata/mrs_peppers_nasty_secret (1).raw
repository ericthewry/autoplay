The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Mrs. Pepper's Nasty Secret</i>, written by Jim Aikin and Eric Eve.  <I>Mrs. Pepper's Nasty Secret</I> was originally released in two competitions which ran concurrently: the IF Beginner's Comp and the Interactive Short Fiction Competition. The game took first place in both of these competitions.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Mrs._Pepper%27s_Nasty_Secret'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Walking home from school is mostly okay, except for one big problem:

<b>Floyd</b> | Every day you have to pass right by Mrs. Pepper's house.  She may not
<b>Floyd</b> | actually be a witch, but she sure acts like one.  She's ugly and
<b>Floyd</b> | crabby, and she seems to go out of her way to cause trouble for you.
<b>Floyd</b> | The time she came at you with the garden rake, swinging it like it was
<b>Floyd</b> | a giant claw ... you still shudder when you think of it.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Last Friday was a new low.  You would never, ever skateboard in her
<b>Floyd</b> | driveway -- that would be practically suicidal.  But somehow when you
<b>Floyd</b> | got to the driveway your skateboard swerved, all by itself, as if
<b>Floyd</b> | somebody had put a spell on it.  And then you fell off.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | While you were picking grit out of the ugly scrape on your skinned

<b>Floyd</b> | elbow, Mrs. Pepper appeared out of nowhere and snatched up your
<b>Floyd</b> | skateboard!  She screeched something about rowdy children,
<b>Floyd</b> | trespassing, and needing to be taught a lesson.  She swung the
<b>Floyd</b> | skateboard at you like it was a bat, and then ran off with it,
<b>Floyd</b> | cackling.  Afterward you rang her doorbell for what seemed like an
<b>Floyd</b> | hour, begging her to give the skateboard back, and she wouldn't even

<b>Floyd</b> | come to the door.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And now it's Monday afternoon, and here you are, on your way home from
<b>Floyd</b> | school as usual (but with no skateboard).  Just up ahead is Mrs.
<b>Floyd</b> | Pepper's driveway....

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After a brief pause, the front door opens.  Mrs. Pepper ventures out
<b>Floyd</b> | on the porch, looks around to make sure no one is close enough to
<b>Floyd</b> | sneak past her into the house, and then bends to retrieve the flyer.

<b>Floyd</b> | For long seconds, she peers at it closely, holding it in both hands.
<b>Floyd</b> | Maybe it's only your imagination, but it looks as if her hands are
<b>Floyd</b> | actually trembling with desire.  Then she turns on her heel and dives
<b>Floyd</b> | back into the house.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A moment later she bursts out again, a large purse over her arm.

<b>Floyd</b> | After carefully locking the door, she strides off in the direction of
<b>Floyd</b> | the driveway.  You hear her car coughing to life, and in a squeal of
<b>Floyd</b> | tires it backs down the driveway, careens into the street, reverses
<b>Floyd</b> | direction, and roars away in a cloud of blue exhaust vapors.

<b>Floyd</b> | Kitchen
<b>Floyd</b> | The kitchen is small, and equipped with the usual appliances,
<b>Floyd</b> | including a cupboard, a sink, a stove, and a refrigerator, though most
<b>Floyd</b> | of the space is taken up by the unusually bulky wooden table standing
<b>Floyd</b> | in the middle of the room.  The back door leads north, while to the

<b>Floyd</b> | south is an open doorway.  A flight of stairs on the west side of the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The fridge contains a large wedge of blue cheese and a stale loaf of

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | There's an overpowering smell of over-ripe cheese.

<b>Floyd</b> | Back Yard
<b>Floyd</b> | The back yard is in a dreadful state.  Except for a few sorry weeds,

<b>Floyd</b> | Moving rather carefully, the elf lifts one foot out of the soil of the
<b>Floyd</b> | pot and extends his leg until the foot (it doesn't really look much
<b>Floyd</b> | like a foot, but you don't get a very good glimpse) touches the soil.
<b>Floyd</b> | In the blink of an eye, his leg takes root. He repeats the procedure
<b>Floyd</b> | with the other foot, and then stands before you quite proudly in the
<b>Floyd</b> | rocky soil of the yard.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You've saved me!" he cries.  "I'm free from that horrible woman's
<b>Floyd</b> | schemes! It was my own fault," he says, looking chagrined.  "Her
<b>Floyd</b> | garden is such a disaster, so dreadful and dismal and abysmal.  Day
<b>Floyd</b> | after day I would see her out there raking, and nothing to rake but
<b>Floyd</b> | rocks!  Finally, one day it was too much for me.  I popped up and told

<b>Floyd</b> | her in no uncertain terms what a shameful mess she'd made of it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "She asked for my help.  Demanded it, truth be told.  I told her,
<b>Floyd</b> | there's not much I can do with a garden so decrepit.  I can encourage
<b>Floyd</b> | a seed to sprout, or perhaps coax a tree to bring forth a few extra
<b>Floyd</b> | blossoms, but fill a garden of gravel with flowers and vegetables?  It

<b>Floyd</b> | would take a hundred elves a hundred days to do it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "She listened to me, nodding all the while.  I thought she understood.
<b>Floyd</b> | But then she did -- something, I'm not sure what, except that I think
<b>Floyd</b> | it was a magic spell that came from the absurd thing she was wearing
<b>Floyd</b> | on her head.  I felt myself getting sleepy, and when I awoke I was in

<b>Floyd</b> | that lonely room, in this pot, completely cut off from the soil of the
<b>Floyd</b> | Earth.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "And then she told me if I wouldn't promise to make her garden grow,
<b>Floyd</b> | she would never let me go!  I told her it was beyond my poor powers,
<b>Floyd</b> | but she didn't want to believe me.  Lately she's begun tormenting me

<b>Floyd</b> | by not watering me.  As if that would convince me to promise something
<b>Floyd</b> | I can't possibly achieve.  We elves know better than to make promises
<b>Floyd</b> | we can't keep.  If you hadn't come along, I'm sure I would have dried
<b>Floyd</b> | up and blown away before another day had gone by. I'd like to give you
<b>Floyd</b> | a reward -- but sad to say, I'm not a leprechaun.  I haven't any gold.
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm just a common garden elf, with only a tiny bit of vegetable magic

<b>Floyd</b> | at my disposal.

<b>Floyd</b> | The front yard is mostly bare dirt and burned-out brown lawn, except

<b>Floyd</b> | The elf stops in the middle of the front yard and nods towards the

<b>Floyd</b> | no indeed.  Watch closely now."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | He gestures at the nearest branch with his long, slim, gnarled

<b>Floyd</b> | This chamber is not much larger than a closet.  The way out is to the

<b>Floyd</b> | Hall
<b>Floyd</b> | This hall is little more than a narrow passage connecting the rooms to

<b>Floyd</b> | Kitchen
<b>Floyd</b> | The kitchen is small, and equipped with the usual appliances,

<b>Floyd</b> | including a cupboard, a sink, a stove, and a refrigerator, though most
<b>Floyd</b> | of the space is taken up by the unusually bulky wooden table standing
<b>Floyd</b> | in the middle of the room.  The back door leads north, while to the
<b>Floyd</b> | south is an open doorway.  A flight of stairs on the west side of the
<b>Floyd</b> | room leads down, roughly opposite the window in the east wall.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The fridge contains a stale loaf of bread and a large wedge of blue
<b>Floyd</b> | cheese.

<b>Floyd</b> | Back Porch
<b>Floyd</b> | The back porch is a plain wooden structure, with no railing or
<b>Floyd</b> | decoration.  It looks as if it was tacked onto the house as an
<b>Floyd</b> | afterthought.  It's several feet above the ground, with a ramp leading

<b>Floyd</b> | up to one side.  The back door leading into the house is just to the
<b>Floyd</b> | south.

<b>Floyd</b> | Back Yard
<b>Floyd</b> | The back yard is in a dreadful state.  Except for a few sorry weeds,
<b>Floyd</b> | nothing grows here.  Someone has dug holes of various sizes, leaving
<b>Floyd</b> | mounds of dirt and gravel everywhere.  A concrete birdbath stands in
<b>Floyd</b> | the center of the yard.  The back porch of the house lies directly to
<b>Floyd</b> | the south.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The driveway is off to the southeast, past the corner of the garage.
<b>Floyd</b> | The garage itself stands directly to the east.

<b>Floyd</b> | Moving rather carefully, the elf lifts one foot out of the soil of the

<b>Floyd</b> | like a foot, but you don't get a very good glimpse) touches the soil.
<b>Floyd</b> | In the blink of an eye, his leg takes root. He repeats the procedure

<b>Floyd</b> | with the other foot, and then stands before you quite proudly in the
<b>Floyd</b> | rocky soil of the yard.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You've saved me!" he cries.  "I'm free from that horrible woman's
<b>Floyd</b> | schemes! I'd like to give you a reward -- but sad to say, I'm not a

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Front Yard
<b>Floyd</b> | The front yard is mostly bare dirt and burned-out brown lawn, except

<b>Floyd</b> | for a few hardy weeds.  A paved walkway crosses it, leading from the
<b>Floyd</b> | sidewalk on the south up to the front porch on the north.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | driveway runs past the yard on the east side, and a tall fence guards
<b>Floyd</b> | what must be the neighbors' yard on the west.  Growing next to the
<b>Floyd</b> | walkway is a scraggly, half-dead tree.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The elf stops in the middle of the front yard and nods towards the
<b>Floyd</b> | tree.  "Do you see that poor bedraggled orange tree there?  It hasn't
<b>Floyd</b> | borne fruit in years, and may never again, unless someone else buys
<b>Floyd</b> | this house and nurtures it back to health.  But it's not quite dead,
<b>Floyd</b> | no indeed.  Watch closely now."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | He gestures at the nearest branch with his long, slim, gnarled
<b>Floyd</b> | fingers.  As you watch, a single bud bursts forth at the end of the
<b>Floyd</b> | branch.  At first no more than a tiny green nub, it swells rapidly.
<b>Floyd</b> | In a few seconds a plump, ripe orange is hanging from the branch.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Go ahead," says the elf.  "Pick the orange and enjoy it.  It's yours.

<b>Floyd</b> | Oh," he adds, handing you your skateboard, "you nearly forgot this."
<b>Floyd</b> | Before you can stammer your thanks -- before you can blurt out the
<b>Floyd</b> | dozen questions jostling in your head about what it's like being an
<b>Floyd</b> | elf, and where he came from, and whether you'll ever see him again --
<b>Floyd</b> | the elf has somehow folded himself inward, like a fast-motion film of
<b>Floyd</b> | a growing plant when the film is run backwards.  He shrinks and runs

<b>Floyd</b> | downward into the soil, and he's gone.
