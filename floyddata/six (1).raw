The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Six</i>, written by Wade Clarke.  <I>Six</I> was originally released as part of the 2011 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took second place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Six'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.

<b>Floyd</b> | Your name is Harriet Leitner, it's the January summer school holidays
<b>Floyd</b> | and today has been a great day.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You turned six this morning! And so did your twin sister, Demi. While
<b>Floyd</b> | Demi is your twin, she is not one of those twins who looks the same as
<b>Floyd</b> | you. Mum has explained that that's because you and your sister are
<b>Floyd</b> | something called fraternal twins. You have decided that you like
<b>Floyd</b> | looking just like yourself, and Demi likes it that way, too.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Today, mum and dad are hosting a fancy dress birthday party for the
<b>Floyd</b> | pair of you and six of your friends: Marion, Ayla, Pia, Sam, Vince and
<b>Floyd</b> | Jack. You're dressed as a fairy and your sister is dressed as a witch,
<b>Floyd</b> | which is what each of you wanted.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You all ate heaps of lollies and played games in the morning, and now
<b>Floyd</b> | your parents have taken you to the park for lunch.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | While mum and dad are setting up the picnic, you and your friends are
<b>Floyd</b> | getting ready to play a game of hide and seek tip. Your sister is
<b>Floyd</b> | sitting this game out to drink some lemonade and cool down.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You agree to be in, and count with your eyes shut against a tree while
<b>Floyd</b> | your friends run off and hide in the park.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "... Forty-eight..." you shout at the top of your lungs. You think
<b>Floyd</b> | carefully about the next number. It's not easy counting this high, but
<b>Floyd</b> | Demi is good at it and she often helps you practise.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "... Forty-nine..." you shout at the top of your lungs.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "... Fifty! Ready or not, here I come!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You really want to win this game. It's time to catch your friends.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Edge of the Park
<b>Floyd</b> | You're at the south edge of the park. It's super hot today and the sun
<b>Floyd</b> | is pouring down on the grass and the flowerbeds. The trees here reach
<b>Floyd</b> | for the sky. Most of them are green and bright, but a few look unhappy
<b>Floyd</b> | and are covered in loose, dry leaves which wobble in the breeze. A good
<b>Floyd</b> | wind will blow them free.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | From here, paths lead north, east and west through the park, and to the
<b>Floyd</b> | south is the picnic area where mum and dad will set up lunch later.

<b>Floyd</b> | Hi. If you already know how to play modern Interactive Fiction games,
<b>Floyd</b> | all you have to do before you start playing Six is learn about the
<b>Floyd</b> | features specific to this game. You can do this by glancing through
<b>Floyd</b> | topics 2 to 6 from the main help menu before you return to the game.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you haven't played Interactive Fiction before, you probably got this
<b>Floyd</b> | game running for the first time by reading the "Instruction manual for
<b>Floyd</b> | those new to Interactive Fiction" which came with it. That manual
<b>Floyd</b> | contains all the information you can find in this built-in help menu,
<b>Floyd</b> | and more. So now you're probably ready to leave this menu and play the
<b>Floyd</b> | game, but remember that if you ever want a quick refresher course on
<b>Floyd</b> | some of Six's special features, you can come back here to the help menu
<b>Floyd</b> | by entering the command HELP.

<b>Floyd</b> | When you combine the game of Tip with the game of Hide and Seek, you
<b>Floyd</b> | get Hide and Seek Tip! Tip is the chasing game you might also know as
<b>Floyd</b> | "Tag", depending on where you live.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In Hide and Seek Tip, the player who is "in" (that's you) closes their
<b>Floyd</b> | eyes and counts to fifty while their friends run away and hide. Once
<b>Floyd</b> | you've finished counting, you have to go looking for your friends. When
<b>Floyd</b> | you find someone, you can't just say, "I see you", like in hide and
<b>Floyd</b> | seek. You have to actually touch the person and say "tip". This is
<b>Floyd</b> | called tipping someone.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Once you've found and tipped all six of your friends, you win the game.

<b>Floyd</b> | Coming up are some special commands you will need to use to play Six.
<b>Floyd</b> | You may discover new ones during the game, too.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | HANDY --- Type this during the game to receive a handy shortened list
<b>Floyd</b> | of all the commands listed below.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | TIP (PERSON) --- When you see one of your friends, try to TIP them.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | CHASE (PERSON) (DIRECTION) --- You can use the CHASE command to try to
<b>Floyd</b> | chase one of your friends in a particular direction. So if you type
<b>Floyd</b> | CHASE JACK WEST, and Jack doesn't outsmart you, Jack will end up
<b>Floyd</b> | running west and you will follow him.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Note that just typing CHASE (PERSON) without mentioning a direction is
<b>Floyd</b> | the same as trying to tip that person.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Chasing your friends where you want them to go can help you catch them,
<b>Floyd</b> | so don't forget to try it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | FOLLOW (PERSON) --- If someone just left the area you're in, you can
<b>Floyd</b> | follow them to wherever they went by typing FOLLOW (PERSON). If you go
<b>Floyd</b> | somewhere else first, though, you will lose track of any people you
<b>Floyd</b> | could have followed from your last location.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | SCORE --- Find out which friends you haven't tipped yet with this
<b>Floyd</b> | command.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | TALK (PERSON) --- To start talking to a person or an animal, or to talk
<b>Floyd</b> | to them some more, type TALK TO (PERSON), the shorter TALK (PERSON) or
<b>Floyd</b> | the supershort T (PERSON). And if there's only one other character
<b>Floyd</b> | around, you can just type TALK or T. Characters will say different
<b>Floyd</b> | things at different times and in different situations, so do lots of
<b>Floyd</b> | talking. If you like the way a conversation is going, TALK to the
<b>Floyd</b> | character again right away to keep it going.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Note that if you've played other Interactive Fiction games, none of the
<b>Floyd</b> | other usual communication commands will work here, and none are needed.
<b>Floyd</b> | There's no ASK, TELL, YES, NO, ORDER, etc& just TALK.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | SEARCH (SOMETHING) --- Some of your friends will be hiding behind stuff
<b>Floyd</b> | in the park. Type SEARCH (SOMETHING) to check if anyone is hiding
<b>Floyd</b> | behind it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Be careful! Just typing EXAMINE (SOMETHING) will not reveal a hidden
<b>Floyd</b> | person, though you will find out whether the object you examined is
<b>Floyd</b> | worth searching.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Also, you can replace the word "search" with "look" or "check" if you
<b>Floyd</b> | prefer, so you can type things like LOOK BEHIND TREE or CHECK UNDER
<b>Floyd</b> | TABLE, with one exception - typing plain old LOOK (THING) will not
<b>Floyd</b> | perform a search. That is no different than typing EXAMINE (THING).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | LISTEN --- If you're walking around the park and you hear someone make
<b>Floyd</b> | a noise, you might want to stop and listen carefully to see if you can
<b>Floyd</b> | work out where it came from. All you have to do is type LISTEN.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | MAP --- This command displays Demi's map of the park. A separate copy
<b>Floyd</b> | of the map is included with Six so that you can view it or print it
<b>Floyd</b> | outside the game.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | * HIT ENTER AT THE PROMPT TO REPEAT YOUR LAST COMMAND * --- As in most
<b>Floyd</b> | Interactive Fiction games, typing AGAIN (or G) will repeat your last
<b>Floyd</b> | command, but there's an easier way to do this in Six - just press ENTER
<b>Floyd</b> | at the prompt without typing any command. Using this method also shows
<b>Floyd</b> | you your last command, so you can be sure you're repeating the thing
<b>Floyd</b> | you actually wanted to repeat.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Please note that the UNDO command can't be repeated by any of these
<b>Floyd</b> | methods. If you want to UNDO several moves in a row without typing UNDO
<b>Floyd</b> | each time, you should tap the up arrow key after each UNDO to pull the
<b>Floyd</b> | command out of your command history, then press ENTER again.

<b>Floyd</b> | * Tip is a game of action, so timing is important in Six. Whenever you
<b>Floyd</b> | move or speak, it takes a turn, and everyone else in the game gets the
<b>Floyd</b> | chance to do something as well. Sometimes if you don't act at the right
<b>Floyd</b> | moment, your friends will escape from you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | * Typing in commands which don't make you move or talk - for instance,
<b>Floyd</b> | LOOK, EXAMINE or SCORE - will not take a turn. If your command doesn't
<b>Floyd</b> | work, that also won't take a turn. Six always shows you whether the
<b>Floyd</b> | last thing you typed took a turn via the NO TIME indicator, which
<b>Floyd</b> | appears in the status bar under your score. Just glance up to the top
<b>Floyd</b> | right corner of the screen, and if you see a line of plus signs there
<b>Floyd</b> | (+++++++) your last command did NOT take a turn. If the pluses aren't
<b>Floyd</b> | there, your last command took a turn as usual.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | * There will be other times when you might want to wait for something
<b>Floyd</b> | to happen. To make a turn pass, type WAIT, or the shortcut Z.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | * Tip is a game for persistent people! You should try to tip your
<b>Floyd</b> | friends lots of times, as they will always be running away from you.
<b>Floyd</b> | There is often a trick to tipping each friend. Pay attention to what
<b>Floyd</b> | your friends do and say and where they go as you chase them around.
<b>Floyd</b> | Don't forget to SEARCH interesting things you see in the park, too, in
<b>Floyd</b> | case your friends are hiding. TALK to all the people and animals you
<b>Floyd</b> | can in different situations, and keep talking to them if what they're
<b>Floyd</b> | saying is interesting, helpful or fun.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | * Tip is a game for witty people. Your friends will do some things
<b>Floyd</b> | differently every time you start a new game of Six, so keep your wits
<b>Floyd</b> | about you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | * Don't forget that you can type HANDY while playing to see a list of
<b>Floyd</b> | all the special and utility commands.

<b>Floyd</b> | Six takes place in Australia, so depending on where you live in the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lollies are sweets and chocolates.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In Australia, it's a tradition that each child at a birthday party
<b>Floyd</b> | receives a lolly bag when they leave. The bag is usually small enough
<b>Floyd</b> | to sit comfortably in the palm of the hand, and is filled up with an
<b>Floyd</b> | assortment of lollies before the party. You won't find out what's in
<b>Floyd</b> | your lolly bag until the party is over.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Fairy bread is white bread spread with margarine, covered in hundreds
<b>Floyd</b> | and thousands and cut into triangles. (If you don't know what hundreds
<b>Floyd</b> | and thousands are, they might be called "sprinkles" where you live.)
<b>Floyd</b> | Fairy bread is commonly served at children's parties.

<b>Floyd</b> | To the north is the entrance to the gazebo. The gazebo is a small house

<b>Floyd</b> | Your name is Demi Leitner, it's the January summer school holidays and
<b>Floyd</b> | today has been a great day.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You turned six this morning! And so did your twin sister, Harriet. As
<b>Floyd</b> | soon as you woke up, you ran to get mum and asked her to measure your
<b>Floyd</b> | height on the wall. You were very excited to find that you were taller
<b>Floyd</b> | again. When your friends started arriving for the birthday party, you
<b>Floyd</b> | put your witch's hat on to make yourself taller than all of them, even
<b>Floyd</b> | Pia.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One of the games you played at home this morning was pass the parcel,
<b>Floyd</b> | and you had a bit of an argument with Harriet over who was holding the
<b>Floyd</b> | parcel when the music stopped for the last time. You're certain it was
<b>Floyd</b> | you, and then dad said you could share it, but then you gave the parcel
<b>Floyd</b> | to Harriet anyway because you like to see her happy. You're better at
<b>Floyd</b> | most games than her, so sometimes you let her win.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You ate so many lollies this morning, you were starting to feel funny,
<b>Floyd</b> | but by the time everyone got to the park for lunch, you felt good
<b>Floyd</b> | again. And now it's time to play hide and seek tip. It's going to be
<b>Floyd</b> | great!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You agree to be in, and count with your eyes shut against a tree while
<b>Floyd</b> | your friends run off and hide in the park.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "... Forty-eight..." you shout at the top of your lungs.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "... Forty-nine..." you shout at the top of your lungs.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "... Fifty! Ready or not, the witch is coming for you!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You really want to win this game. It's time to catch your friends.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Edge of the Park
<b>Floyd</b> | This is the south edge of the park. The sky is blue and bright today,
<b>Floyd</b> | and the air is warm. Pretty flowers shake in the breeze around the base
<b>Floyd</b> | of some super-tall trees. A few of the trees look unwell, and the curly
<b>Floyd</b> | leaves on the unwell ones are ready to fall off.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Paths lead north, east and west, and to the south is the picnic area.

<b>Floyd</b> | West Side of the Moreton Bay Fig
<b>Floyd</b> | You stand before the biggest tree in the park, the Moreton Bay Fig. It
<b>Floyd</b> | seems to come from a world of giants. Close to the trunk, the roots
<b>Floyd</b> | alone are often taller than you are! They coil around each other like
<b>Floyd</b> | giant stone snakes. The tree blocks out the sky, and the top is so far
<b>Floyd</b> | away you can't see it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This is the west side of the tree. You can make your way east around to
<b>Floyd</b> | the other side. There are also paths to the south and west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To the north is the pointy-roofed little building called the gazebo,
<b>Floyd</b> | but nobody is in there today because the way in is blocked by a big
<b>Floyd</b> | spider web. Sitting in the middle of the web is the orb weaver spider
<b>Floyd</b> | who made it. Wow, that web is amazing!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Standing in the shade of the tree is a brave knight... well, maybe not
<b>Floyd</b> | a brave one. It's Sam. His grey armour doesn't fit him too well, so he
<b>Floyd</b> | looks a bit funny.

<b>Floyd</b> | You hear a bird cry out as you enter this big, open grassy area. To the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Paths also lead north, south and east from here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sitting on the hedge beside the entrance to the maze is a big black

<b>Floyd</b> | In the Hedge Maze
<b>Floyd</b> | You have entered the hedge maze. Tall green walls of square hedge bend
<b>Floyd</b> | around each other, forming tricky patterns. It's spooky and mysterious,
<b>Floyd</b> | even on a sunny day. But it's exciting, too.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There are yellow arrows painted on the ground wherever you walk here.
<b>Floyd</b> | If you ever get lost, you can follow the arrows to the exit.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &lt;&lt;  You won't need to make a map of the maze - In fact, it cannot be
<b>Floyd</b> | mapped! Just pay attention to what your ears and eyes tell you.   &gt;&gt;
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &lt;&lt;  Also, compass directions don't work in here. Use LEFT and RIGHT
<b>Floyd</b> | instead. You can type EXIT to leave the maze at any time.   &gt;&gt;
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now, how would you like to control your movements while in the maze?
<b>Floyd</b> | Please choose one of the following setups by pressing 1 or 2:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 1 - Type LEFT to go left, RIGHT to go right and L to look.
<b>Floyd</b> | 2 - Type L to go left, R to go right and LOOK to look.

<b>Floyd</b> | West Side of the Moreton Bay Fig
<b>Floyd</b> | You stand before the biggest tree in the park, the Moreton Bay Fig. It

<b>Floyd</b> |
