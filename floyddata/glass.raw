<b>Floyd</b> | The Prince sits awkwardly on the couch, holding his glass slipper and
<b>Floyd</b> | trying to keep it from crushing. Lucinda and Theodora have the ends of
<b>Floyd</b> | the same couch, and they are taking turns seeing who can bend lowest
<b>Floyd</b> | and show off the most cleavage; while the old lady, in her wing chair,
<b>Floyd</b> | carries on about nonsense. For instance:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Do tell me about your father's health," she says, leaning toward the
<b>Floyd</b> | Prince. "Is he still ailing? Has the Spanish doctor been able to do
<b>Floyd</b> | anything for him?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Prince looks uncomfortable: this line of reason leads directly to
<b>Floyd</b> | the problem of heirs. "I believe so, madam," he replies, with a bit of
<b>Floyd</b> | constraint.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can only squawk things for everyone to hear.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It's true, you know, that my father threw the ball in the hope that I
<b>Floyd</b> | would-- that is, that it would lead to a greater acquaintance--" The
<b>Floyd</b> | Prince stops again, rattled, and glares down at the small shoe cradled
<b>Floyd</b> | in his hands. "I had not been very attentive to ladies in my youth."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The old lady looks very strange at that remark. "Well-- my dear boy--"
<b>Floyd</b> | she begins. "I am glad you feel comfortable-- that is, I will not
<b>Floyd</b> | mention-- if you feel you prefer--"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He blinks thick girlish lashes, and you see why she is worried. "No, I
<b>Floyd</b> | didn't mean that I have a preference for boys, madam," he remarks,
<b>Floyd</b> | more at his ease now that she is uncomfortable. "Only that I have been
<b>Floyd</b> | very much occupied with other concerns, and not..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He gestures. The shoe almost slips off its pillow. He catches it just
<b>Floyd</b> | in time.

</b><b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle input">&gt; X SHOE</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is very small for an adult woman's foot.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm sure it's nothing surprising," remarks the old lady, "if you
<b>Floyd</b> | didn't meet anyone at the ball that you felt immediately you could
<b>Floyd</b> | marry. Such short acquaintances... there's much more to an alliance
<b>Floyd</b> | than that. One must feel at ease with the family, for instance."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Prince opens his mouth, then closes it again. "I did meet
<b>Floyd</b> | someone," he admits. "But I know nothing of her family. It hardly
<b>Floyd</b> | matters to me, however. It will be the woman who can wear this shoe."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The old woman laughs slightly. "How beautifully romantic! But -- she
<b>Floyd</b> | didn't give you her name?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Prince shakes his head, looking embarrassed again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "...but you would recognize her, at least," the lady says, looking
<b>Floyd</b> | down carefully at her hands folded on her skirt. "As soon as you saw
<b>Floyd</b> | her face--"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I can't be sure," the Prince replies.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a thick silence. The old lady frowns, suggesting very rapid
<b>Floyd</b> | and dangerous thought. Theodora lies back against the pillows,
<b>Floyd</b> | interested in the story and too stupid to realize it has to do with
<b>Floyd</b> | her. Lucinda-- but Lucinda's thoughts are always the hardest to read.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | More compact than Theodora, and with more self-control.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It wasn't a masked ball," the old lady says. "It wasn't even badly
<b>Floyd</b> | lit. Your father did not stint on the candles at all."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Prince opens his mouth.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh, dear, dear, I am being odiously prying. I'm so sorry. Perhaps you
<b>Floyd</b> | met this young lady out on the terrace..." She trails off, suggesting
<b>Floyd</b> | the very faintest disapproval of young ladies who linger on terraces,
<b>Floyd</b> | out of sight of chaperones, to hold conversations with Princes, and
<b>Floyd</b> | never tell their names.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I met her in candlelight," says the Prince, goaded. "But she left me
<b>Floyd</b> | at midnight."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The effect of this comment is like the shattering of glass: for a
<b>Floyd</b> | moment you wonder if he dropped the shoe...? No. It is merely that he
<b>Floyd</b> | has admitted, or near-as-admitted, that his chosen bride is one who
<b>Floyd</b> | appeared to him under a glamor, a magical enchantment. A crime
<b>Floyd</b> | punishable by death under his father's law.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A spark of comprehension comes into Theo's eyes. "Yes," she says. "She

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Prince looks at you for a long moment, then turns to the old lady;
<b>Floyd</b> | who shrugs, as though to say that she knows the game is up. Fishing in
<b>Floyd</b> | her pocket she draws out the true slipper. "The other one is only a

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You are a harridan," says the Prince. "A conniving, treacherous,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You could still try the shoe on Lucinda," she suggests mildly.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Do tell me about your father's health," she says, leaning toward the

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The Prince sits awkwardly on the couch, holding his glass slipper and
<b>Floyd</b> | trying to keep it from crushing. Lucinda and Theodora have the ends of
<b>Floyd</b> | the same couch, and they are taking turns seeing who can bend lowest
<b>Floyd</b> | and show off the most cleavage; while the old lady, in her wing chair,
<b>Floyd</b> | carries on about nonsense. For instance:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Do tell me about your father's health," she says, leaning toward the
<b>Floyd</b> | Prince. "Is he still ailing? Has the Spanish doctor been able to do
<b>Floyd</b> | anything for him?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Prince looks uncomfortable: this line of reason leads directly to
<b>Floyd</b> | the problem of heirs. "I believe so, madam," he replies, with a bit of
<b>Floyd</b> | constraint.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Heavens," says the Prince mildly. "A pet with theological leanings.
<b>Floyd</b> | How unusual. You're most fortunate in your domesticated animals,
<b>Floyd</b> | madam."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The old lady gives you a long, narrow-eyed look. Apparently she does
<b>Floyd</b> | not share the Prince's feelings on that topic.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm sure it's nothing surprising," remarks the old lady, "if you
<b>Floyd</b> | didn't meet anyone at the ball that you felt immediately you could
<b>Floyd</b> | marry. Such short acquaintances... there's much more to an alliance
<b>Floyd</b> | than that. One must feel at ease with the family, for instance."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Prince opens his mouth, then closes it again. "I did meet
<b>Floyd</b> | someone," he admits. "But I know nothing of her family. It hardly
<b>Floyd</b> | matters to me, however. It will be the woman who can wear this shoe."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The old woman laughs slightly. "How beautifully romantic! But -- she
<b>Floyd</b> | didn't give you her name?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Prince shakes his head, looking embarrassed again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "...but you would recognize her, at least," the lady says, looking
<b>Floyd</b> | down carefully at her hands folded on her skirt. "As soon as you saw
<b>Floyd</b> | her face--"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I can't be sure," the Prince replies.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a thick silence. The old lady frowns, suggesting very rapid
<b>Floyd</b> | and dangerous thought. Theodora lies back against the pillows,
<b>Floyd</b> | interested in the story and too stupid to realize it has to do with
<b>Floyd</b> | her. Lucinda-- but Lucinda's thoughts are always the hardest to read.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It wasn't a masked ball," the old lady says. "It wasn't even badly

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Prince opens his mouth.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh, dear, dear, I am being odiously prying. I'm so sorry. Perhaps you
<b>Floyd</b> | met this young lady out on the terrace..." She trails off, suggesting
<b>Floyd</b> | the very faintest disapproval of young ladies who linger on terraces,
<b>Floyd</b> | out of sight of chaperones, to hold conversations with Princes, and
<b>Floyd</b> | never tell their names.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I met her in candlelight," says the Prince, goaded. "But she left me
<b>Floyd</b> | at midnight."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The effect of this comment is like the shattering of glass: for a
<b>Floyd</b> | moment you wonder if he dropped the shoe...? No. It is merely that he
<b>Floyd</b> | has admitted, or near-as-admitted, that his chosen bride is one who
<b>Floyd</b> | appeared to him under a glamor, a magical enchantment. A crime
<b>Floyd</b> | punishable by death under his father's law.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Prince looks uncomfortable: this line of reason leads directly to

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The old woman laughs slightly. "How beautifully romantic! But -- she

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh, dear, dear, I am being odiously prying. I'm so sorry. Perhaps you
