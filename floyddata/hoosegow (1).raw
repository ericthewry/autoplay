The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Hoosegow</i>, written by Jack Welch and Ben Collins-Sussman.  <I>Hoosegow</I> was originally released in 2010 as part of the Jay is Games Casual Gameplay Design Competition 7, where it took first place.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The sheriff climbs onto his horse, spits, and you begin to rumble

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Muddy shakes his head. "No offense, Sheriff, but I reckon you got the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the twilight, you sight the sheriff's sturdy brick office near the
<b>Floyd</b> | edge of town. "That's mighty fine construction," notes Muddy, sounding
<b>Floyd</b> | less feisty now. "Mighty fine indeed." The coach rolls to a halt and a
<b>Floyd</b> | thick arm yanks you roughly from your seat. You land awkwardly in the
<b>Floyd</b> | rutted street, where the sheriff holds you in place with the heel of
<b>Floyd</b> | one boot. He yells to his men, "Bring the coach around back, we got to
<b>Floyd</b> | impound that evidence." You are shoved into the sheriff's office and
<b>Floyd</b> | then into a small holding cell.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The deputy wakes with a start, whips his dusty boots off the desk and
<b>Floyd</b> | stands, tucking his shirt back into his pants. The sheriff gives him a
<b>Floyd</b> | brief, judgmental glance and offhandedly tosses an arrest warrant on
<b>Floyd</b> | the desk. He barks, "Jimbo, listen up. Picked up these two down near
<b>Floyd</b> | the train. A federal marshal will be coming for them at eight o'clock
<b>Floyd</b> | tomorrow morning. There's going to be a hanging!" The deputy nods
<b>Floyd</b> | slowly. The sheriff continues, "Please take care of our 'guests'. I
<b>Floyd</b> | got to head down to Wichita Falls to discuss my invention with some
<b>Floyd</b> | investors, so you is in charge." The deputy smiles until the sheriff
<b>Floyd</b> | adds, "Jimbo, don't screw up," as he heads out the door.

<b>Floyd</b> | Jail Cell
<b>Floyd</b> | Why are you not surprised to have landed right back in the hoosegow
<b>Floyd</b> | after another one of Muddy's dubious plans? Will you ever learn? How
<b>Floyd</b> | did it come to this?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other,
<b>Floyd</b> | with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork
<b>Floyd</b> | above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff's
<b>Floyd</b> | office.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A broken stool lies on the floor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Muddy leans against the wall tapping a harmonica on his arm.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is
<b>Floyd</b> | stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious
<b>Floyd</b> | to your presence.

<b>Floyd</b> | * There are three ways of driving the deputy out of the jail; how many

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | * Did you try reading the initials engraved on the stool?  Repeatedly?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Some other random trivia:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | * The game is set in the Indian Territory, which would later become
<b>Floyd</b> | the Oklahoma territory and subsequently the state. How many references
<b>Floyd</b> | can you find to the musical "Oklahoma!"?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | * In the real Old West, it wouldn't have made any sense to put beans
<b>Floyd</b> | in a can. They were a cheap staple, transported dry, likely in sacks.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | * Boot spurs were referred to as "can openers" in the Old West.
<b>Floyd</b> | Really.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | * The transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, but it crossed
<b>Floyd</b> | two states to the north of Oklahoma. The first railroads in Oklahoma
<b>Floyd</b> | were built in 1870, and the state wasn't crossed until 1871.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | * The espresso machine was invented in 1901 in Italy, but we figured
<b>Floyd</b> | that so many Old West movies came from Italy, that it would look
<b>Floyd</b> | natural enough in our story.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | * The slang "hoosegow" comes from the Spanish juzgado, which was a
<b>Floyd</b> | type of judge tribunal.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, if you've read this far down the page, you deserve to know

<b>Floyd</b> | The sheriff enters the office, shotgun in hand. You and Muddy freeze
<b>Floyd</b> | in your tracks and raise your hands in the air. The sheriff kicks the
<b>Floyd</b> | prone deputy, who stirs slowly at first, but then jumps to his feet.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You." The sheriff points at you. "Your name Muddy?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "No. I ain't Muddy," you reply. "That there is Muddy. I is Rick."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Damn. What were she thinking?" growls the sheriff. "Mary Sue, you
<b>Floyd</b> | come on in here now, you hear?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A young woman -- you hesistate to guess her actual age on account of
<b>Floyd</b> | propriety -- edges nervously into the office, her eyes cast to the
<b>Floyd</b> | ground. By the way she walks, you guess she is in a family way, and
<b>Floyd</b> | after she turns towards Muddy, there's no question. Judging by the
<b>Floyd</b> | size of her belly, you'd have to say five, maybe six months. She
<b>Floyd</b> | raises her eyes to Muddy and her face brightens.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Oh, Lordie," mutters Muddy, closing his eyes and running his hand
<b>Floyd</b> | over his face. "The one thing I don't plan -- and look what happens."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lowering the shotgun, the sheriff walks over and puts his arm around
<b>Floyd</b> | Muddy's shoulders. Distributing cigars to you and the deputy, he
<b>Floyd</b> | smiles, "Deputy Jimbo, Rick -- I'd like you to meet my new son-in-law,
<b>Floyd</b> | Muddy. Ain't that right, Muddy?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I do reckon it's better than a-hanging."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Muddy never sees it coming. Mary Sue's roundhouse punch lands square
<b>Floyd</b> | on his jaw, launching him towards the jail bars like a sack of
<b>Floyd</b> | potatoes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well," you observe, "maybe this marriage just might work out."

<b>Floyd</b> | The sheriff's wheelchair rolls up the front ramp, and he enters the
<b>Floyd</b> | office with his multicultural posse, who represent the diverse members
<b>Floyd</b> | of the community of Endangered Arthropod Valley. Two of the named
<b>Floyd</b> | women in his posse discuss a subject other than men. The sheriff draws
<b>Floyd</b> | a nonlethal weapon that has not been tested on animals, and waves it
<b>Floyd</b> | in a non-threatening manner at you and your partner.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The deputy finishes his yoga stretches and stands up, draining his
<b>Floyd</b> | bottle of health water and setting the recyclable bottle on the
<b>Floyd</b> | renewable hardwood desk. "Sheriff, we had a right pleasant evening,
<b>Floyd</b> | and I reckon these gentlemen is sincerely regretful of their
<b>Floyd</b> | wrongdoings."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The sheriff agrees, "I do reckon, but they still got to repay their
<b>Floyd</b> | crime, even if the blame for that crime ultimately rests on society
<b>Floyd</b> | itself, and is the result of a poor educational system and the lack of
<b>Floyd</b> | adequate social welfare and state institutions."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The deputy nods sagely, "How about some community service? The
<b>Floyd</b> | Gunslinger's Significant Other Association runs a camp for autistic
<b>Floyd</b> | spectrum disorder orphan Native Americans on the outskirts of town. I
<b>Floyd</b> | reckon they could use a hand running their cruelty-free all-vegetarian
<b>Floyd</b> | farm."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a murmur of agreement from the posse, and the sheriff claps
<b>Floyd</b> | the deputy on his back. "That's mighty forward thinking of you,
<b>Floyd</b> | James."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Muddy gives you a distressed look and asks the sheriff, "I reckon I'd
<b>Floyd</b> | prefer the hanging. Is that still an option?"

<b>Floyd</b> | The sheriff strolls into the office and immediately notices the
<b>Floyd</b> | portrait. Hands on his hips, he admires the painting. "I declare, that
<b>Floyd</b> | *do* make the office. It breaks up that entire space. That wall were
<b>Floyd</b> | so stark and empty before you done hung it. I owe you two a debt of
<b>Floyd</b> | sincere gratitude."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Muddy considers the painting as well and then looks around the room.
<b>Floyd</b> | "That seemed the right place to hang it, considering you got all them
<b>Floyd</b> | wood tones in the desk and the cabinet, and yonder doorway gives that
<b>Floyd</b> | area a bright, natural light most of the day."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The deputy stirs. "Yeah," he adds, "It's a shame we don't got no
<b>Floyd</b> | windows in the office, excepting in the jail cell. I reckon we could
<b>Floyd</b> | knock out that front wall and put in a bay window, maybe add a window
<b>Floyd</b> | treatment that would soften the room a jot. Also, how about a stencil?
<b>Floyd</b> | Something rustic, running as a trim, just below the ceiling."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You brew four cups of dark, whole-bodied espresso, sprinkling the top
<b>Floyd</b> | with nutmeg. The steam curls upward and fills the room with a rich
<b>Floyd</b> | aroma. You settle down on the plush wraparound couch that has appeared
<b>Floyd</b> | in the office and join the sheriff, the deputy and Muddy in browsing
<b>Floyd</b> | through a book of fabric swatches.
