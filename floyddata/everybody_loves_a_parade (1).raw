NightFloyd Transcript:<BR><B><I>Everybody Loves a Parade</I> by Cody Sandifer</b></FONT><FONT FACE='arial, sans-serif, helvetica' SIZE='1'></BR>As played on ifMUD on September 7, 2011</FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2">
Like ClubFloyd, the idea behind NightFloyd is that a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</BR></BR>Unlike ClubFloyd, NightFloyd often (but not always) takes on significantly larger works of interactive fiction, knowing going in that each one will take multiple sessions.  NightFloyd is also a bit more informal than ClubFloyd in that it's only announced on the ifMUD #clubfloyd bulletin board, and the time shifts around to meet player's schedules far more than ClubFloyd does.  NightFloyd is organized by genericgeekgirl, aka Adri.</BR></BR>
Below is a transcript of <i>Everybody Loves a Parade</i>, written by Cody Sandifer.  <I>Everybody Loves a Parade</I> was released in 1997.  It was nominated for Xyzzies for Best NPCs and Best Puzzles.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Everybody_Loves_a_Parade'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | tadsr - A text-only TADS 2.5.10 Interpreter.
<b>Floyd</b> | Copyright (c) 1993, 2006 by Michael J. Roberts.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Cheap goddam bastards.  When the city of New York hired you on as
<b>Floyd</b> | Assistant to the Chief Engineer, the least they could have done was
<b>Floyd</b> | fork out a few hundred bucks for a one-way ticket.  And, come to think
<b>Floyd</b> | of it, a professional moving service.  Instead, here you are --
<b>Floyd</b> | shooting past the Arizona desert in a rented Move-It (tm) van, hauling
<b>Floyd</b> | your junk from one coast to the other.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To keep yourself awake, you flip on the radio.  Static.  Nothing but
<b>Floyd</b> | static.  You scan the countryside, hoping to find anything out of the
<b>Floyd</b> | ordinary.  Not a chance.  Nothing but sameness; hundreds of dead
<b>Floyd</b> | rabbits, thousands of cacti.  Your eyes come to settle on a single
<b>Floyd</b> | magnificent saguaro, and your head starts to nod.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As your head tilts forward, your eyes come to rest on the gas gauge,
<b>Floyd</b> | and a twist of anxiety shoots up your back.  The gas gauge flutters
<b>Floyd</b> | nervously above empty, and there's not a town in sight.  In fact, even
<b>Floyd</b> | if you find a place to stop, you're not even sure that you have the
<b>Floyd</b> | cash to fill up the van.  (Hmmm...didn't you spend your last five bucks
<b>Floyd</b> | on tacos 70 miles back?)  If you don't stumble across another pitiful
<b>Floyd</b> | desert ghost town -- and soon -- you'll be stranded.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For the next few miles, you concoct a desperate plan involving
<b>Floyd</b> | energy-saving relaxation techniques and, if necessary, upholstery
<b>Floyd</b> | sandwiches.  You start to wonder if day-old rabbit meat is safe to eat.
<b>Floyd</b> | Then, as your eyes refocus on the road, you realize that there's a
<b>Floyd</b> | billboard right smack dab in front of you. Your head twitches to the
<b>Floyd</b> | side, and you catch sight of the good news.  CHEWTON -- 10 MILES.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you get closer to town, you note that the speed limit drops to 35.
<b>Floyd</b> | Looks like the highway cuts through town.  Good.  It should be easier
<b>Floyd</b> | to find a gas station that way.  Then you spot the banner, bright
<b>Floyd</b> | purple and as gaudy as loafers at a funeral:  WELCOME TO CHEWTON!
<b>Floyd</b> | PLEASE STAY FOR OUR 40th ANNUAL ROCK FESTIVAL!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Huh.  You wonder which has-beens they talked into playing this cheap
<b>Floyd</b> | excuse for civilization.  Is Cheap Trick still around?  Did Journey
<b>Floyd</b> | regroup?  Lost in thought, you instinctively step on the gas to sneak
<b>Floyd</b> | under a closing railroad guard.  In seconds, a crowd of merry-makers
<b>Floyd</b> | walls you in.  You slam on your brakes and take in the spectacle which
<b>Floyd</b> | fills your field of vision:  hamburger vendors, screaming kids, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | colorful parade that stretches as far as the eye can see.  You squint
<b>Floyd</b> | to get a better look, and then roll your eyes and chuckle.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After all, you know what they say...

<b>Floyd</b> | Move-It Van
<b>Floyd</b> |    Aside from a few balled-up taco wrappers, there isn't much to see.
<b>Floyd</b> | The dashboard is cracked, the upholstery is soiled, and your seat is
<b>Floyd</b> | itchy and uncomfortable.  A garden of delights, it ain't.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Set into the dashboard are the usual Move-It(tm) luxuries:  a cigarette
<b>Floyd</b> | lighter, an ashtray, and a glove compartment.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Step right up ladies and gentlemen!"  With this statement, a juggler

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Cheap goddam bastards.  When the city of New York hired you on as
<b>Floyd</b> | Assistant to the Chief Engineer, the least they could have done was
<b>Floyd</b> | fork out a few hundred bucks for a one-way ticket.  And, come to think
<b>Floyd</b> | of it, a professional moving service.  Instead, here you are --
<b>Floyd</b> | shooting past the Arizona desert in a rented Move-It (tm) van, hauling
<b>Floyd</b> | your junk from one coast to the other.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To keep yourself awake, you flip on the radio.  Static.  Nothing but
<b>Floyd</b> | static.  You scan the countryside, hoping to find anything out of the
<b>Floyd</b> | ordinary.  Not a chance.  Nothing but sameness; hundreds of dead
<b>Floyd</b> | rabbits, thousands of cacti.  Your eyes come to settle on a single
<b>Floyd</b> | magnificent saguaro, and your head starts to nod.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As your head tilts forward, your eyes come to rest on the gas gauge,
<b>Floyd</b> | and a twist of anxiety shoots up your back.  The gas gauge flutters
<b>Floyd</b> | nervously above empty, and there's not a town in sight.  In fact, even
<b>Floyd</b> | if you find a place to stop, you're not even sure that you have the
<b>Floyd</b> | cash to fill up the van.  (Hmmm...didn't you spend your last five bucks
<b>Floyd</b> | on tacos 70 miles back?)  If you don't stumble across another pitiful
<b>Floyd</b> | desert ghost town -- and soon -- you'll be stranded.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For the next few miles, you concoct a desperate plan involving
<b>Floyd</b> | energy-saving relaxation techniques and, if necessary, upholstery
<b>Floyd</b> | sandwiches.  You start to wonder if day-old rabbit meat is safe to eat.
<b>Floyd</b> | Then, as your eyes refocus on the road, you realize that there's a
<b>Floyd</b> | billboard right smack dab in front of you. Your head twitches to the
<b>Floyd</b> | side, and you catch sight of the good news.  CHEWTON -- 10 MILES.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you get closer to town, you note that the speed limit drops to 35.
<b>Floyd</b> | Looks like the highway cuts through town.  Good.  It should be easier
<b>Floyd</b> | to find a gas station that way.  Then you spot the banner, bright
<b>Floyd</b> | purple and as gaudy as loafers at a funeral:  WELCOME TO CHEWTON!
<b>Floyd</b> | PLEASE STAY FOR OUR 40th ANNUAL ROCK FESTIVAL!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Huh.  You wonder which has-beens they talked into playing this cheap
<b>Floyd</b> | excuse for civilization.  Is Cheap Trick still around?  Did Journey
<b>Floyd</b> | regroup?  Lost in thought, you instinctively step on the gas to sneak
<b>Floyd</b> | under a closing railroad guard.  In seconds, a crowd of merry-makers
<b>Floyd</b> | walls you in.  You slam on your brakes and take in the spectacle which
<b>Floyd</b> | fills your field of vision:  hamburger vendors, screaming kids, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | colorful parade that stretches as far as the eye can see.  You squint
<b>Floyd</b> | to get a better look, and then roll your eyes and chuckle.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After all, you know what they say...

<b>Floyd</b> | Move-It Van
<b>Floyd</b> |    Aside from a few balled-up taco wrappers, there isn't much to see.
<b>Floyd</b> | The dashboard is cracked, the upholstery is soiled, and your seat is
<b>Floyd</b> | itchy and uncomfortable.  A garden of delights, it ain't.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Set into the dashboard are the usual Move-It(tm) luxuries:  a cigarette
<b>Floyd</b> | lighter, an ashtray, and a glove compartment.

<b>Floyd</b> | Oldsmobile, which is jacked up and in mid-repair.  On first impression,
<b>Floyd</b> | the garage appears to be deserted -- the garage is quiet, and a stout
<b>Floyd</b> | metal desk lies unmanned in one corner.  However, on further
