						The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each
						week at a pre-arranged time, a group of
						people meet online to cooperatively play
						a game of interactive fiction.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Midnight. Swordfight.</em> written by Chandler Groover.
						It received third place overall, and first place for the Miss Congeniality Award, in the 2015 Interactive Fiction Competition. 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting

					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing this game, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played this game, and think you might like to at some
						point, I do not recommend reading any further. Instead,
						you might want to return to the <a class="decorate" href=

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | charade?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You're overcome with outrage and you lunge toward Onegin. It's
<b>Floyd</b> | certainly a pretty sight to see him flinch, but your cutlass never
<b>Floyd</b> | even grazes him before you've been repelled by the countess. Her sword
<b>Floyd</b> | intercepts your own; she's faster; she has pushed you back.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Your challenge is with me!" she says.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And then her rapier is in your gut, your innards spilling out. Somehow
<b>Floyd</b> | she must have done it when your focus was on Onegin. His smile is the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You swing around, your cutlass slashing sideways through the air, in

<b>Floyd</b> | Ferdinand by surprise.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She has your wrist, her knee is in your gut, and suddenly your arm is

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I'll tell you how I first saw the countess," says Dmitri. "It was a
<b>Floyd</b> | twilight evening some years back, and I was standing outside with the
<b>Floyd</b> | crowd on the steps leading into the opera house. If you aren't
<b>Floyd</b> | familiar with the opera house, it's situated beside a canal, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | long stairway runs down from the piazza to the water. People arrive in
<b>Floyd</b> | gondolas, and naturally there's a lot of preening and parading on that
<b>Floyd</b> | staircase.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, from where I was standing I could see something marvelous
<b>Floyd</b> | coming down the water. It was like a carriage, like a chariot,
<b>Floyd</b> | completely gold and drawn by seven bottlenose dolphins. They were
<b>Floyd</b> | pulling it through the canal just like a horse would pull a carriage
<b>Floyd</b> | on a street. But what's a bottlenose dolphin, you ask? I didn't know
<b>Floyd</b> | at the time, but since then I've learned that they're a highly
<b>Floyd</b> | endangered marine mammal. They look like very large, sleek fish, and
<b>Floyd</b> | supposedly there aren't more than fifty still alive. And
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">seven</span> were pulling that chariot through the canal. You can
<b>Floyd</b> | imagine the spectacle when it drew to a stop at the staircase and its
<b>Floyd</b> | passenger emerged. That passenger was none other than the countess.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You don't need me to describe her appearance. She's always the most
<b>Floyd</b> | gorgeous person in the room -- or, in this case, on the waterfront.
<b>Floyd</b> | Everything she wore shimmered with diamonds. The world seemed to come
<b>Floyd</b> | into more focus around her, to clarify, like something magnified under
<b>Floyd</b> | a jeweler's loupe. You could feel that everybody in the crowd had
<b>Floyd</b> | either fallen in love with her immediately (if they weren't in love
<b>Floyd</b> | with her already), or that they were just boiling with jealousy, but
<b>Floyd</b> | she didn't pay any attention to them. She didn't climb the staircase
<b>Floyd</b> | either. Instead she went over to a walkway extending beneath a nearby
<b>Floyd</b> | bridge's underpass and came out again with the most grimy little
<b>Floyd</b> | urchin in the city. That child had been camped beneath that underpass
<b>Floyd</b> | for weeks, eating rats from a sewage pipe that emptied into the canal.
<b>Floyd</b> | Since there weren't many rats, the child wasn't very healthy. The
<b>Floyd</b> | countess took the child and actually wrapped it in her own cloak,
<b>Floyd</b> | right there in front of everybody at the opera house, and then she
<b>Floyd</b> | helped it step into her chariot and drove away again without even the
<b>Floyd</b> | slightest hello or goodbye to her socialite peers.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "What an outrage that scene caused! I can hardly remember the opera
<b>Floyd</b> | itself because I was still thinking about the countess during the
<b>Floyd</b> | whole performance. Later on, the scandal was splashed all over the
<b>Floyd</b> | papers, but the countess never cared. She had seen someone in need and
<b>Floyd</b> | that was the only thing that mattered to her. Now I have it on good
<b>Floyd</b> | authority that her street urchin eats all the rats that anyone could
<b>Floyd</b> | ever want."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "What does Ferdinand see in you, anyway? You're certainly not her peer

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Everyone else is gone, but Dmitri is sitting at the table as though

<b>Floyd</b> | Somehow a rift must have opened, because obese cherubs are pouring
<b>Floyd</b> | through the air onto the banquet-table; or at least, they would be
<b>Floyd</b> | pouring if they were in motion. There are several hundred, faces
<b>Floyd</b> | grimacing and feathered wings shedding blue pinions, and in their
<b>Floyd</b> | conglomerate they have impacted the table at one end, sending the
<b>Floyd</b> | other end skyward like a see-saw. Some even appear to be crawling
<b>Floyd</b> | upward along the table as rats would a mast aboard a sinking ship.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This arrangement has naturally relocated the banquet itself into
<b>Floyd</b> | midair, where roasts and cakes and goblets and plates hang with their
<b>Floyd</b> | glazes and their silver sparkling.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When it comes to the diners, most have already departed, although a
<b>Floyd</b> | few remain watching the cherubs with mild interest from seats pushed
<b>Floyd</b> | back against the walls. One lady dressed as a swan is eating angels on

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The countess is suddenly there, only inches away, but before she has
<b>Floyd</b> | the chance to strike with her tremendous kielbasa, your own sword
<b>Floyd</b> | rises to parry the blow. You did not even attempt to react; your
<b>Floyd</b> | vorpal blade did it for you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It also did much more than that. It has sliced her weapon in half,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When the vorpal blade has finished, your arm flicks it downward as an

<b>Floyd</b> |
