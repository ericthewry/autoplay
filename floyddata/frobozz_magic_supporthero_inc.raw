The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Frobozz Magic Support</i>, written by Nate&nbsp;Cull.  <i>Frobozz Magic Support</i> was originally released in 1996. It received a XYZZY Award nomination for Best Puzzles and won the XYZZY for Best Individual NPC. You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Frobozz_Magic_Support"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

</br>As a bonus, once we were done playing <i>Frobozz Magic Support</i>, we moved on to playing another Cull game, <i>Hero, Inc</i>, so I've just included that in the transcript as well.  Enjoy!</br>

So, if you've never played these games, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | "You think you can defeat ME?"  screams the Serious Fraud's voice,

<b>Floyd</b> | You're dead, man!  You're dead!  You're..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a sudden explosion from the lift shaft, and then silence.  The

<b>Floyd</b> | fades.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The watch beeps and displays: "ONE DOWN".
