						The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each
						week at a pre-arranged time, a group of
						people meet online to cooperatively play
						a game of interactive fiction.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>When the Land Goes Under the Water</em> written by Bruno Dias (as Nikephoros De Kloet).
						It was a Commended entry in ShuffleComp: Disc 2. 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting

					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing this game, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played this game, and think you might like to at some
						point, I do not recommend reading any further. Instead,

<b>Floyd</b> | Orichalcum is bright green and flecked with veins of gold, a nobler

<b>Floyd</b> | be: Polished and perfect, unbreakable, eternal. The walls of the
<b>Floyd</b> | Emperor's Palace, the Oceanic Bulwarks, all shone with gleaming green
<b>Floyd</b> | that reflected its tint onto the people and streets of the City. And
<b>Floyd</b> | then they were all shattered like the tiles in the square. Were they
<b>Floyd</b> | even orichalcum at all, she wondered, or just cleverly-painted ceramic
<b>Floyd</b> | glaze? She squinted at them, and could not remember the pattern of the

<b>Floyd</b> | Chanting Row was one of the city's main throughfares. It was wide as

<b>Floyd</b> | all the way to the Eastern Sea Gate.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In ages past, pleasure ships would dock right up to the avenue's end,
<b>Floyd</b> | disgorging nobles riding opulent sedan chairs. She had never seen
<b>Floyd</b> | that. Before the land's breaking, the eastern end of the row had been
<b>Floyd</b> | taken over by tenements and poorhouses, a dumping ground for the
<b>Floyd</b> | city's abandoned. The pleasure ships would dock on the Western Sea
<b>Floyd</b> | Gate, instead.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This stretch used to run west to east, straight and true, so much so
<b>Floyd</b> | one could see the sea from this end; but then it had become twisted
<b>Floyd</b> | and broken, surrounded by rubble. The square was to the west. The

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A cage of silver, blackening at the edges. Inside, ensconced safely

<b>Floyd</b> | that makes it uncomfortable to hold, though the stone emits no heat.
<b>Floyd</b> | Instead, one holds it by a leaden hoop attached to the top.
