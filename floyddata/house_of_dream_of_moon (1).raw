<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2">
The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>House of Dream of Moon</i> by the IF Whispers Team.  <i>House of Dream Moon</i> is the third creation from IF Whispers collaborations, which are a sort of interactive fiction coded in the spirit of <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse"><U>ex</U>q<U>uisite cor</U>p<U>se</U></A>, where multiple authors create a single piece of interactive fiction, but each author only has access to the code directly preceding theirs.

You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/House_of_Dream_of_Moon"><u>the IFwiki</u></A>.

</BR></BR><B>A Special Note:</B> Unfortunately, the day we played <I>House of Dream of Moon</I>, we were having some trouble with Floyd, and he crashed a few times.  This is an issue with Floyd, not the game.  I have included links which allow you to skip over any redundant commands we had to enter (sometimes quite a few) to catch up to where we were in the game prior to the crash.

</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played it, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | Near a Huge Device
<b>Floyd</b> | The trees have been cut back to make room for this tall device. Looking
<b>Floyd</b> | up at it, you see that it looks like...a phallus? Oh wait, it's a
<b>Floyd</b> | missile. Kind of the same thing, but instead of a little death there's
<b>Floyd</b> | great big death.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | A cheerful-looking man in a black two-piece suit and black horn-rimmed

<b>Floyd</b> | You can also see some rope here.

<b>Floyd</b> | Your very first night is over in your new house.  It still seems
<b>Floyd</b> | surreal that you are now the proud owner of this place.  It doesn't
<b>Floyd</b> | quite feel like home yet since you haven't been able to get your
<b>Floyd</b> | furniture.  However, you can't get the rental truck until tomorrow.
<b>Floyd</b> | Maybe today would be a good idea to explore those woods behind your
<b>Floyd</b> | house.  It'll be a good way to kill time until you can get properly

<b>Floyd</b> | moved in tomorrow.
