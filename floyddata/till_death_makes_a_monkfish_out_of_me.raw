The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Till Death Makes a Monk-Fish Out of Me</i>, written by Jon Ingold & Mike Sousa.  <i>Till Death Makes a Monk-Fish Out of Me</i> was originally released as part of the 2002 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took second place. It went on to be nominated for foud Xyzzy Awards, including Best Game, Best Individual Puzzle, Best Story, and Best Writing.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Till_Death_Makes_a_Monk-Fish_Out_of_Me"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

<b>Floyd</b> | A huge thanks to John Bichard, tester extraordinaire.  His timely
<b>Floyd</b> | reports and incredible attention to detail has made this game so much
<b>Floyd</b> | better.  Thank you!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Any bugs, typos, grammar gaffes or run-time errors are solely my fault.

<b>Floyd</b> | I probably added some "finishing touches" and neglected to have
<b>Floyd</b> | somebody else take a look.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Special thanks to Mike Roberts for TADS.  I am so looking forward to
<b>Floyd</b> | working with T3.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | A big thank you to Stephen Granade -- I can't envision the comp without
<b>Floyd</b> | him.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Most of the code is home grown, or taken from my other works.  I did
<b>Floyd</b> | need to borrow a couple of modules so thanks to Dan Schmidt for his
<b>Floyd</b> | disambig.t module.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Because this was the first game that required some parsing hacks, I
<b>Floyd</b> | needed to borrow code there too.  A very big thanks to Suzanne Britton
<b>Floyd</b> | for her Chatter library.  Her parseAskobjIndirect routine saved me a
<b>Floyd</b> | lot of time and frustration.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Last, but definitely not least, thanks Jon.  You were a pleasure to
<b>Floyd</b> | work with -- I'm in awe of your uncanny ability to write, create and
<b>Floyd</b> | problem solve.  I hope I didn't ruin the writing by adding some default
<b>Floyd</b> | responses here and there.  :)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 2 notes

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks to Paul O'Brian for his insigtful script file(s) -- numerous
<b>Floyd</b> | typos and default responses tweaked.  Thanks to Andrew Plotkin for
<b>Floyd</b> | providing different options for manipulating the Metal Rod.

<b>Floyd</b> |    The corridor continues around the curve of the base to the
<b>Floyd</b> | northwest, to the rooms of the various scientists.  This one is of
<b>Floyd</b> | interest though, perhaps - it is the door to Kurner's room - chosen by

<b>Floyd</b> | lottery, it is the nearest to all the machinery and so the loudest to
<b>Floyd</b> | be in.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The door itself is quite a sight if you like hybridised tech - Kurner
<b>Floyd</b> | being the paranoiac he is has fitted it with a Russian retinal scanner,
<b>Floyd</b> | a thumb-reader and a voice tag detector.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | On the screen is a collection of Dr.  Kurner's documents - mostly
<b>Floyd</b> | uninteresting; work reports, one is apparently the first draft of a
<b>Floyd</b> | novel called "Vengeance is my Sister".  There is one open already - and
<b>Floyd</b> | it catches your eye.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is the design for a black-box module with a multistrand wire feed
<b>Floyd</b> | that looks not a whole lot unlike the one plugged into your beloved
<b>Floyd</b> | upstairs.  You skim over the opening mechanism and make a note of it,
<b>Floyd</b> | before ploughing into the circuits themselves.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Quickly the patterns form.  The search processes have been altered - no
<b>Floyd</b> | longer the first-mind-in-set-location pattern you'd programmed, but
<b>Floyd</b> | rather a nearest-to-base scan.  And the criteria - you'd demanded a
<b>Floyd</b> | certain age, fitness, and suntan level for your subject.  Kurner's
<b>Floyd</b> | level is set for ... good grief...
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | That explains it then.  That box must have been in place this morning,
<b>Floyd</b> | when you stepped into the machine.  It's set up to find the nearest
<b>Floyd</b> | dead body it can and transfer.  Thinking back - didn't Kurner collapse
<b>Floyd</b> | when the machine fired?  Maybe he had a heart attack or something, then
<b>Floyd</b> | machine transferred you in.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Only one thing to do then.  Get back to the machine, and reprogram that
<b>Floyd</b> | box to get you back.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | Don't you mean "NOTES"?  I thought so...

<b>Floyd</b> | From Here to There -- a Brief Time-Line
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    The collaboration between Jon and I started on November 21, 2001
<b>Floyd</b> | when Jon responded to my personal ad on RAIF.  For the next two weeks,
<b>Floyd</b> | we bounced ideas back and forth and on December 11, 2001, Jon sent over
<b>Floyd</b> | the first script (opening scene).  By this time, we already had signed

<b>Floyd</b> | up for Adam Cadre's Spring Thing, with the full intention of finishing
<b>Floyd</b> | up this game for that comp.  We never made it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    I started coding on 12/11/01 and we worked through the holidays.  By
<b>Floyd</b> | mid January we had 3 written scripts -- and two weeks later, the first
<b>Floyd</b> | version of the game was sent to Jon for review/testing.  It ended with

<b>Floyd</b> | the PC leaving the mortuary.  Apart from a small post-holiday lag, we
<b>Floyd</b> | were firing on all cylinders.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Both Jon and I then, inexplicably, stopped.  We stopped emailing,
<b>Floyd</b> | writing and coding.  Weird.  On April 16, 2002, I sent Jon a note that
<b>Floyd</b> | said we should scrap the Spring Thing and possibly re-focus for the

<b>Floyd</b> | fall comp.  Jon agreed.  We decided to touch base in a month or so.
<b>Floyd</b> | For those of you keeping score, there were things going on, in both our
<b>Floyd</b> | worlds, that caused delays -- so we did understand how we ended up
<b>Floyd</b> | missing the May deadline.  Anyway...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Did I say a month?  I meant three.  In early July, Jon and I hooked

<b>Floyd</b> | up again and came up with a game plan to finish this.  It had been a
<b>Floyd</b> | long time since the original story was discussed/created and we needed
<b>Floyd</b> | to re-acquaint ourselves with the premise.  I had finished
<b>Floyd</b> | coding/testing the game which at that point, ended with the "chase"
<b>Floyd</b> | scene near the computer room.  The end script was all that was left --
<b>Floyd</b> | well, what I thought was the end script.  Unbeknownst to me, there was

<b>Floyd</b> | a lot of game left to be written/coded.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    By mid July, I lined up some beta testers so that we could get a
<b>Floyd</b> | head start on the testing.  John Bichard and Dave Gatewood helped quite
<b>Floyd</b> | a bit at this point.  While waiting for Jon's final script, I was busy
<b>Floyd</b> | fixing bugs, typos and errant daemons.  They also questioned some of

<b>Floyd</b> | the story which allowed Jon to make some changes with the final script.
<b>Floyd</b> | They were invaluable.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    By early August, Jon had sent over the script containing Kurner's
<b>Floyd</b> | Office followed by the end script.  Yikes.  I had a lot of coding to
<b>Floyd</b> | do.  On 9/1, I finished coding the end script supplied by Jon.  For the

<b>Floyd</b> | next 3 1/2 weeks, we tested, tested and tested.  The hint system was
<b>Floyd</b> | added as an afterthought and didn't get much testing, or in the very
<b>Floyd</b> | least, read by the grammar police.  :)

<b>Floyd</b> | Hi Mike -

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm a stupidly busy person at present, but one with a hankering to
<b>Floyd</b> | Write Stuff, and I read that your collaboration with Robb was a
<b>Floyd</b> | writer/programmer split...  which I find kinda tempting, so if you'll
<b>Floyd</b> | have me I'd be interested.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | If you say a "storyboard", how much work is there left for writing?
<b>Floyd</b> | Just get the text to fill the gap, or is there design still to do?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Cheers,
<b>Floyd</b> | Jon

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Jon,
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Where to begin...heh...
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | &ltsnip&gt;
<b>Floyd</b> | With that said, how's Make It Good and your other puzzle game going?  I
<b>Floyd</b> | wouldn't want conflicts skewing your schedule with those games --
<b>Floyd</b> | that's if you had a timetable in mind.  I was looking for a spring
<b>Floyd</b> | release and just like that, Adam announces his Spring Thing.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | During the first collaboration note (which ended up being the NTTS
<b>Floyd</b> | project), I had come up with several rules of engagement that was
<b>Floyd</b> | needed for the project (in terms of my part) to be successful.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I had to code it.  Writing is not my thing so what else would I do if I
<b>Floyd</b> | didn't code it?  The other author did most/all of the writing -- see

<b>Floyd</b> | point one.  It had to be in TADS.  I don't know Inform, nor do I care
<b>Floyd</b> | to learn another language -- I'm sorta saving that for TADS 3.  It had
<b>Floyd</b> | to be NTTS because it was inspired by my daughter.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Other than that, the collaboration just grew and came to be pretty
<b>Floyd</b> | successful.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With this collaboration, point 1, 2 and 3 will still be true.  I
<b>Floyd</b> | obviously have a different game in mind and would like to implement it,
<b>Floyd</b> | but I'm not closing any doors with other ideas.  And my idea of a
<b>Floyd</b> | storyboard is probably a lot different from that of a good writer.  I

<b>Floyd</b> | have a plot/theme (a hook, if you will) along with several puzzles.  I
<b>Floyd</b> | have an ending, but I don't care for it and it will probably change.
<b>Floyd</b> | It's a puzzle game.  The storyboard probably fits on one sheet of a
<b>Floyd</b> | legal pad.  Heh...  Are you still interested?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Cheers,

<b>Floyd</b> | -- Mike
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (by the by, I can't believe you wrote AR in the time it takes my three
<b>Floyd</b> | year old daughter to eat a piece of toast...  That timeline couldn't
<b>Floyd</b> | possibly happen for this one, Jon.  I have a full time job, a wife and
<b>Floyd</b> | twin daughters...  ..  :)

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We're still trying to decide if we can work together

<b>Floyd</b> | Hmm...  I don't have a vast amount of time, and I do have several

<b>Floyd</b> | - how long do you expect the game to be?  If we're talking Comp length

<b>Floyd</b> | then yeah, okay, let's do it, I can commit myself to that.  If we're
<b>Floyd</b> | talking longer, it might be a good idea if I pull out.  But -- but I've

<b>Floyd</b> | Yes, I'm thinking/planning Comp length game that would be entered into

<b>Floyd</b> | to give you the impression that I could manage an aggressive schedule
<b>Floyd</b> | (like AR) and I didn't want multiple projects impacting everything.
<b>Floyd</b> | So, I guess we're ready for the next step?

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I have to do a couple of things.  One, is get through this Thanksgiving
<b>Floyd</b> | holiday (it's today, and for a lot of my family, tomorrow as well).
<b>Floyd</b> | Then I need to put the storyboard in an email and shoot it off to you
<b>Floyd</b> | (it's currently scribbled across several pieces of paper in my work
<b>Floyd</b> | folder).  Once you get the plot/theme and what I'm trying to

<b>Floyd</b> | accomplish, we can then see if it's a match.  (Maybe you'll hate the

<b>Floyd</b> | Hi Mike -
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Right, yes.  That's the only other sticking point as I see it - if it's

<b>Floyd</b> | this sounds like fun!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Things I should perhaps note - no aggressive schedule is likely.  AR
<b>Floyd</b> | was an accident like that; not one I intend to repeat if I can help it.

<b>Floyd</b> | From:  Mike Sousa
<b>Floyd</b> | To:  ji207@cam.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Okay, here I go.  Before I get into the story, let me shed some light
<b>Floyd</b> | as to how I came up with the idea.  Also, I *hope* it's sorta unique --

<b>Floyd</b> | I've only been around for less than two years and haven't played all
<b>Floyd</b> | the recent games.  I've also written three and that has taken up a lot
<b>Floyd</b> | of 'play time' so to speak, so I typically give a game a short spin but
<b>Floyd</b> | rarely do I finish it.  Case in point, I *still* haven't finished
<b>Floyd</b> | Anchorhead, even though I've been playing it for over a year.  But
<b>Floyd</b> | anyway...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I think I was playing the opening of Hunt the Wumpus and kept dying.  I
<b>Floyd</b> | then thought about all the games I wrote and how dying was to be
<b>Floyd</b> | avoided at all risk -- it was, in fact, a failure that needed to be
<b>Floyd</b> | undone/restored.  (heh, NTTS -- scene 1, aside).  I then thought that
<b>Floyd</b> | certain games won't allow you to die (you do a good job of this, by the

<b>Floyd</b> | way, at least from what I've seen) and come up with clever messages to
<b>Floyd</b> | keep the player from reaching the dreaded "You have died" screen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | That's when I thought of a game that its primary goal was to try and
<b>Floyd</b> | kill yourself (and fail, multiple times).  Now, I don't want a suicide
<b>Floyd</b> | type of game -- that is not me, I'm an optimist by nature.  But I

<b>Floyd</b> | struggled to find the hook.  Why would the player want the PC to kill
<b>Floyd</b> | himself?  It needs to be worthwhile, because why would a player want to
<b>Floyd</b> | continue to try to harm the PC?  By the by, the 'puzzle' aspect comes
<b>Floyd</b> | in with different ways the PC tries to kill himself and because of
<b>Floyd</b> | Murphy's Law, he fails.  A simple example is taking sleeping pills but
<b>Floyd</b> | because of food poisoning (from the lunch he had several hours ago), he

<b>Floyd</b> | ends up throwing everything up and the suicide attempt fails.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | writing needs to be upbeat and have humor sprinkled in (including the
<b>Floyd</b> | puzzles) to keep it going.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The hook is this:  (or some variation -- this was just the first
<b>Floyd</b> | attempt)

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The player character was part of a science project to clone
<b>Floyd</b> | consciousness.  He was supposed to go back into his own body, but the
<b>Floyd</b> | project was sabotaged and he was sent to the body of a corpse instead
<b>Floyd</b> | (with The Bad Guy presuming that would kill him).  You awake from the
<b>Floyd</b> | morgue / whatever and need to kill yourself in order to shunt yourself

<b>Floyd</b> | back to where you belong.  So starts the journey of returning to your
<b>Floyd</b> | body -- your wife and kids miss you, ya know!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Here's how the story lays out:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Opening text (needs to be well done in order for the player to 'want'

<b>Floyd</b> | to kill the PC so that he can return to whatever and know that the PC
<b>Floyd</b> | is really the consciousness and not the 'body' of the PC.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | First puzzle is the only puzzle to the player.  Should be easy, well
<b>Floyd</b> | clued and set the tone for the rest of the game.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Middle game consists of x number of puzzles (death attempts, if you
<b>Floyd</b> | will) that will lead to solving the final puzzle in the end.  This can
<b>Floyd</b> | be inventory items that appear from failed attempts or just wisdom
<b>Floyd</b> | gained from the failed attempts.  All puzzles can/should be accessed by
<b>Floyd</b> | the PC at the same time -- avoiding the linear 'thing'.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | End game is the final puzzle that gets you 'back'.  I want it to be
<b>Floyd</b> | elaborate, multi-staged and fit into the overall theme of the game.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Well, there you have it.  Again, it's not a 'Jump' type of game.
<b>Floyd</b> | Suicide is not the message and that's an important distinction.  I just
<b>Floyd</b> | wanted to play with the standard 'avoid death at all costs, because

<b>Floyd</b> | that means you failed!'.  In this game, 'avoid staying alive at all
<b>Floyd</b> | costs, that means you failed!'.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I haven't written anything yet nor do I have 1 line of code written.
<b>Floyd</b> | What I do have is this email and 3 or 4 death attempts with solutions
<b>Floyd</b> | as to how they fail along with a list of other ways that the PC could

<b>Floyd</b> | try and kill himself -- it just needs a solution to the 'puzzle'.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now, before you respond, please note that I have extremely thick skin.
<b>Floyd</b> | I take criticism the way it should be taken -- use it to one's
<b>Floyd</b> | advantage.  If you don't like the idea, the theme, or the direction, a
<b>Floyd</b> | simple "Not what I had in mind" can do.  Obviously, I'm interested in

<b>Floyd</b> | what you think and whether you see the need for any subtle/drastic
<b>Floyd</b> | changes to the plot or if you have something totally different in mind.
<b>Floyd</b> | I guess what I'm saying is that just speak what you feel and it'll be
<b>Floyd</b> | put to good use.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;Hi Mike -
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;Heh...  I read your "hook" with a growing grin - this is exactly (give

<b>Floyd</b> | or
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;take a backstory) the idea I came up with a while back; a game where
<b>Floyd</b> | death
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;is the solution to a puzzle (mine was a "nine lives" game,
<b>Floyd</b> | incidentally,

<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;and is currently one/ninth written).  So -- hmmm -- I like the idea.
<b>Floyd</b> | I like
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;the tone as well, black comedy is fun, and the attempted-death
<b>Floyd</b> | resulting
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;in a step forward is a very neat and tidy idea indeed; as your player

<b>Floyd</b> | will
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;slowly begin to realise that he _has_ to try every available method of
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;death, and even though the PC will think maybe this one will work,
<b>Floyd</b> | there's
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;a certain inevitability about the failure each time.  So eventually we

<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;have, say, the player wants the hook from the ceiling, which he pulls
<b>Floyd</b> | down
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;with the rope, but if you just tug at the rope the PC responds "But if
<b>Floyd</b> | you
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;pull out the hook, you won't be able to use it as a noose!"  -- and

<b>Floyd</b> | when
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;you do try to hang yourself, out comes
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;the hook.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Excellent!  We're on the same page...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;Which would suggest to me that in the final stage, the solution is not
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;actually to kill yourself at all, but to do something cunning with
<b>Floyd</b> | what
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;you've collected so far.  That would need the backstory working out,

<b>Floyd</b> | so:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Yes, exactly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;Obvious thing needed - some sort of rigourous logic behind the
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;conciousness transfer, to ensure players aren't left going "but

<b>Floyd</b> | exactly
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;why would killing myself make any difference?"  That needs to be nice
<b>Floyd</b> | and
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;tight.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Yes.  The opening text is critical here and we can then either sprinkle
<b>Floyd</b> | more info during the game by flashbacks (I know, done to death at
<b>Floyd</b> | times, but in this case, has some merit) or supply some type of 'doc'
<b>Floyd</b> | that allows the PC to learn more about it...  Just throwing ideas
<b>Floyd</b> | out...
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;So, yeah, this sounds like a nice idea.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;Things that spring to mind:- first puzzle is to escape from inside a
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;coffin, then escape from the morgue, and should be done using the most
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;number of comic-book-style body-parts possible.  Lever things open

<b>Floyd</b> | with
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;arms, that sort of thing.  Something macabre, but intrinsically silly.

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;A nice framing story might be:  you are about to get married to your

<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;affection.  Given one chance to set things right as a restless spirit
<b>Floyd</b> | you
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;inhabit a body - but to your horror you find you've not got your old
<b>Floyd</b> | body,

<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;but the body of someone else!  So to get your old body back, you must
<b>Floyd</b> | leave
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;the one you're in and possess the right one.  (Admittedly; this allows
<b>Floyd</b> | for
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;no possibility of a truly "happy" ending).

<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;...the reason I suggest this is I just had a neat idea for a title:

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Hi Jon.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I gave more though to the zombie like example you had below and I don't
<b>Floyd</b> | know if the 'kill' yourself theme can survive the whole game.  My
<b>Floyd</b> | original thought was that the PC's consciousness (known as spirit going
<b>Floyd</b> | forward -- much easier to type) was transferred to somebody who was

<b>Floyd</b> | freshly dead, so to speak.  So I had visions of laying on a metal
<b>Floyd</b> | table, naked (save for a sheet), prep'd for an autopsy, with a tag on
<b>Floyd</b> | your toe that read "Jon Doe", uh, I mean, "John Doe", time of death, nn
<b>Floyd</b> | hours.  By taking this body over you could then be bound by 'normal'
<b>Floyd</b> | rules of physics when it came to attempting death.  I still like/want
<b>Floyd</b> | the morbid humor that can be brought, though.  So the first puzzle, as

<b>Floyd</b> | you mentioned, was escape from the coroner's 'office', but the
<b>Floyd</b> | puzzle(s) would be concentrating on finding out who you are/were
<b>Floyd</b> | (maybe), getting some clothes, and exiting the building without being
<b>Floyd</b> | noticed.  During this 'stage', a daemon/timer/trigger/whatever would
<b>Floyd</b> | unfold more of the story and set your goal. End this life so that your
<b>Floyd</b> | consci, uh, spirit can be channeled back to your body.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now, the framing of being murdered is good (best friend/arch rival) and
<b>Floyd</b> | if done by the spirit transfer science project, it lends itself to a
<b>Floyd</b> | happy ending because you can go back to your original body --- and it
<b>Floyd</b> | allows us to contemplate alternate endings in which you go back to the
<b>Floyd</b> | body of your arch rival or something...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Anyway, once you leave the building, you start your journey of trying
<b>Floyd</b> | to kill yourself (sorta like the 9 lives things) except each death
<b>Floyd</b> | attempt fails because of some silly/stupid reason of murphy's law.
<b>Floyd</b> | That's how we (um, you) can keep the writing light and not let the
<b>Floyd</b> | 'suicide' theme ever enter anybody's mind.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In this scenario, the big part missing is how do you go back to your
<b>Floyd</b> | body.  Do you finally succeed in a suicide attempt?  Do you consult a
<b>Floyd</b> | psychic?  Do you find a way to send a message to your lab partner or do
<b>Floyd</b> | you end up visiting your 'lab' and figure it out yourself?  (yeah, just
<b>Floyd</b> | throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks)

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But, if you think the only way this can be pulled off is the unreal
<b>Floyd</b> | nature (losing limbs, macabre plot that bring teh funny, etc...)  then
<b>Floyd</b> | we'll need to come up with a different middle game because if the
<b>Floyd</b> | player knows the PC is already 'dead', they probably wouldn't want to
<b>Floyd</b> | continue killing it...  maybe?

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Anyway, we should decide on the angle and the resulting end story for
<b>Floyd</b> | it.  Then we can figure out what's the best way to work together and
<b>Floyd</b> | start working on the opening text/scene with the flow of the first
<b>Floyd</b> | puzzle(s).
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Sound like a plan?

<b>Floyd</b> | Jon comes up with time travel twist...
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | To:
<b>Floyd</b> | Fr:  Jon
<b>Floyd</b> | Subject:  Game plans
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hi Mike -
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Bouncing ideas back and forth is good - generates good games, generates
<b>Floyd</b> | *enthusiasm*.  So here are a few more.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I like the metal table vision - actually, I like the tag-on-the-toe
<b>Floyd</b> | vision, that's funny; especially if we don't tell the player they've
<b>Floyd</b> | woken up as a corpse.  At some point maybe we could have a puzzle where

<b>Floyd</b> | teh PC needs to sign in somewhere/rent a car/that sort of thing, but he
<b>Floyd</b> | can't speak (because dead people don't breathe) so he hands over the
<b>Floyd</b> | tag with his name on.  Or rather, he sticks his foot on the counter
<b>Floyd</b> | because he can't untie the string.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One thought I had which would be nice design wise, was a gradual shift

<b>Floyd</b> | in what how the player sees the game; so, to start with, he sees a
<b>Floyd</b> | guillotine and sticks his head inside, hoping to lop his block off
<b>Floyd</b> | (which fails, but somehow opens up a door somewhere else).  However,
<b>Floyd</b> | our player will soon realise each time is going to fail which leads to
<b>Floyd</b> | the nice situation of the player having to convince the PC that what
<b>Floyd</b> | he's being asked to do is actually a suicide attempt, when in truth the

<b>Floyd</b> | player doesn't expect it to work.  (so, the hook-and-noose example from
<b>Floyd</b> | earlier).  I think that would be nicely comic.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I quite like the idea of coming back as the arch-rival; in fact, I was
<b>Floyd</b> | thinking - if we have the PC wake up as a freshly dead body, and
<b>Floyd</b> | scatter through the game (and maybe a short intro sequence in which the

<b>Floyd</b> | experiment happens, I'm a fan of run-in's in games) clues (conflicting
<b>Floyd</b> | + red herrings) as to who the body is.  Eventually it is revealed that
<b>Floyd</b> | you've woken up as who died, say, two days ago; and you have in fact
<b>Floyd</b> | gone back in time slightly.  You reverse your experiment, land up in te
<b>Floyd</b> | body of your arch rival, just in time to heft a hatchet and swing it
<b>Floyd</b> | into the machinery before the experiment starts...  (actually, I liked

<b>Floyd</b> | having a straight ghost/murder idea, just because I like the idea of
<b>Floyd</b> | the game ending with the PC 'coming to' dizzyily, looking around,
<b>Floyd</b> | seeing his former self enter the room, spotting the fire-axe on the
<b>Floyd</b> | wall...  game stops.  It's a cheeky ending, but quite fun.)  This would
<b>Floyd</b> | also open standard time-travel riffs:- our PC must fix the final step
<b>Floyd</b> | of the machinery which no-one knew needed doing, because when they

<b>Floyd</b> | arrived teh next morning it'd just been done by the PC, that sort of
<b>Floyd</b> | thing.  Which is to say - I'd like the time travel idea just so the
<b>Floyd</b> | game can end neatly, happily, but not-so-happily.  Bad guy (arch-rival)
<b>Floyd</b> | gets his comeuppance; only he's not really such a bad guy, as he didn't
<b>Floyd</b> | really do anything (we could sprinkle the game with the PC remembering
<b>Floyd</b> | what the arch-rival did actually do, and they could be a series of

<b>Floyd</b> | pathetic attacks, which have left the PC rather surprised by being
<b>Floyd</b> | murdered).

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Let me see if I can try to recap/extrapolate what the story looks like

<b>Floyd</b> | now, it's probably wrong, but it's a starting point...  :)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Short intro scene where the spirit experiment fails.  You see 'stuff',
<b>Floyd</b> | hints of what to do.  Your spirit is sent backwards in time to a dead
<b>Floyd</b> | body.  We need to validate this with some date doc in the game -- some
<b>Floyd</b> | world event in the newspaper or something.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Opening scene is now limited, you wake up on the metal table with a toe
<b>Floyd</b> | tag.  The Player will most likely think "heh, they *thought* I was
<b>Floyd</b> | dead, but I'm apparently not, but who am I?"  PC solves some easy
<b>Floyd</b> | puzzle(s) to get into the game (editorial to start -- I'm a huge fan of
<b>Floyd</b> | rewarding the player right away in the opening scene so that they feel

<b>Floyd</b> | as if they've accomplished something and gives them an edge to continue
<b>Floyd</b> | playing -- nothing turns me off more than wandering around in nn rooms,
<b>Floyd</b> | accomplishing nothing for 30 minutes -- maybe it's just my short
<b>Floyd</b> | attention span.  editorial ends)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Once the first puzzle(s) are done, the game opens up and the Player

<b>Floyd</b> | should know that he needs to (get back?  kill himself?  unknown -- go
<b>Floyd</b> | figure stuff out?)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The middle game will consist of attempts to end one's life that fails
<b>Floyd</b> | or did we switch gears to something else?  (I'm trying to stay with you
<b>Floyd</b> | but I'm getting the feeling I drive at 80KPH and you're approaching

<b>Floyd</b> | 100KPH!)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The end solution is to get back to the experiment and sabotage the
<b>Floyd</b> | machine that sent you back.  But if this is the goal, why would the
<b>Floyd</b> | Player (or PC) want to continually try and kill the PC?
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | I like your last paragraph in your last email, about the PC figuring
<b>Floyd</b> | out what to do, sorta gives the Player the "aha" moment which is one of
<b>Floyd</b> | the coolest things us authors can make the Player do.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | See if you can lay down the plot in terms of intro text/sequence,
<b>Floyd</b> | 'opening scene', middle game and how it all ties up at the end.  I've

<b>Floyd</b> | tried to do it here but there's some confusion on my part.  Before I
<b>Floyd</b> | can start contributing to a story, I need to have a firm grasp of the
<b>Floyd</b> | story -- call it a character flaw...  :)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Great stuff, Jon...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hi Mike -
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Right, I was thinking this through, here's where I'm at.  I have an
<b>Floyd</b> | idea for something building in my head, here's the backstory but below
<b>Floyd</b> | I explain how it's drip-fed to the player.  You may need to print this
<b>Floyd</b> | out and read it carefully, I think it's quite dense, and it's pretty
<b>Floyd</b> | long.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The body the PC transfers into is that of his arch-rival.  There is
<b>Floyd</b> | time-travel as before, but the arch-rival has died, unbeknownst to the
<b>Floyd</b> | player, before the start of the game.  The events run:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The experiment proceeds.  Just as the player enters we see the
<b>Floyd</b> | Arch-rival putting down a fire-axe.  The experiment goes wrong.  The

<b>Floyd</b> | player is zapped [to the evening of the previous day] into the body of
<b>Floyd</b> | the arch-rival-saboteur.  He breaks into the machine's room, in time to
<b>Floyd</b> | sabotage the machine just as the ORIGINAL PLAYER enters.  As the
<b>Floyd</b> | machine kicks in, the man in the machine slumps, you slump, and you
<b>Floyd</b> | wake up back in your own body.  The technicians look around in a panic
<b>Floyd</b> | as [it seems to them that] the Arch-rival has just dropped dead

<b>Floyd</b> | spontaneously (because they weren't aware of the fact he was a dead guy
<b>Floyd</b> | wandering around).  In fact, it seems to them that the machine
<b>Floyd</b> | malfunctioned and killed him.  So - the player succeeds in killing the
<b>Floyd</b> | BODY as we originally claimed he should.  We have a happy ending.  We
<b>Floyd</b> | have someone, a little confused by the fact one body has died twice.
<b>Floyd</b> | We end the game.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Follows a more detailed series of events/puzzles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ---
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Game begins with the doors sliding shut on the player's

<b>Floyd</b> | machine-experiment thing.  As it hisses closed an irreversible
<b>Floyd</b> | countdown is begun ("5...  4...")  There is a note taped to the inside
<b>Floyd</b> | of the (transparent) door.  The note, when the player examines it
<b>Floyd</b> | reads:  "I'll get you now" or somesuch.  [If we run with the plot
<b>Floyd</b> | detailed above, there are two choices at this point - one, we craft a
<b>Floyd</b> | note which can be read two ways, one is "I'll get you sonny" but it can

<b>Floyd</b> | also be read in its intended way; and it wasn't in fact written by any
<b>Floyd</b> | enemy at all.  This may be impossible, but then, it would be very neat
<b>Floyd</b> | if such a phrasing exists.  Two - the note was pinned before, by the
<b>Floyd</b> | rival himself, before he was killed.  This is a little unlikely, as why
<b>Floyd</b> | would he do that _before_ sabotaging the machine?  Maybe he did
<b>Floyd</b> | sabotage it, before he is killed, just not very well.  This is fine,

<b>Floyd</b> | and can be easily told to the player near the end.]  The player tries
<b>Floyd</b> | to escape, but cannot, tries to talk to his lab-technicians, but they
<b>Floyd</b> | can't hear.  If he bangs on the glass they wave excitedly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On count of four a lab boy says "Hey, look at this."  They all gather
<b>Floyd</b> | round, and very stupidly, and very slowly, speak in obvious sentences

<b>Floyd</b> | "Do you suppose that wire is supposed to be hanging out and sparking
<b>Floyd</b> | like that?".  It is made clear that some damage has been made to the
<b>Floyd</b> | machine, but that they're unable to do anything about it.  The player
<b>Floyd</b> | is forced to sit and watch, looking at his taped note, with no way out
<b>Floyd</b> | until he is ZAPPED.  (I think this sequence could be very funny.  I
<b>Floyd</b> | like the doors sliding shut with a polite note saying "You're about to

<b>Floyd</b> | die" -- ooh, better "If you are reading this, you are already dead.").
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Player comes to, lying in a long metal drawer in a wall of 'filing'
<b>Floyd</b> | cabinets (mortuary slabs, freezers, think the X-Files or that bit in
<b>Floyd</b> | Men In Black), where the corpse he's now in has been stored away.  On
<b>Floyd</b> | his toe-tag is written "Jack Doe".  We are several feet up from the

<b>Floyd</b> | floor, and attempting to jump down responds that it's far too far.  If
<b>Floyd</b> | you look around the cabinets, a few other drawers are labelled and
<b>Floyd</b> | mentioned:  "John Doe", "Jim Doe", "Jenny Doe"; just a handful though
<b>Floyd</b> | (we're not modelling an entire cabinet here, there's no need, just
<b>Floyd</b> | enough for the absurd image of a wall of Doe-family metal-pallets).
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The solution to getting to the ground is to pull open Jenny's cabinet
<b>Floyd</b> | which is below you, climb onto that, and then drop to the floor.  When
<b>Floyd</b> | you do, the PC comments that Jenny appears to be fast asleep, and you
<b>Floyd</b> | are "very careful" when you climb onto her pallet; only accidentally
<b>Floyd</b> | kicking her in the head when your foot slips and sitting on her chest.
<b>Floyd</b> | However, you stands gingerly, and "you don't seem to have woken her up.

<b>Floyd</b> | Phew!"  Of course, our player will quickly realise he is dead, she is
<b>Floyd</b> | dead, everybody's dead; but the PC continues to chatter about how they
<b>Floyd</b> | must have moved him here for observation after the experiment went a
<b>Floyd</b> | bit wrong.  (Our PC is dense, for comic value).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We end up on the floor of the room - one wall is filing cabinet

<b>Floyd</b> | drawers; there's a door and a large window.  The corridor beyond the
<b>Floyd</b> | window is dark, so the glass acts as a mirror - and you see your
<b>Floyd</b> | reflection - fat, old, long grey hair.  Crucially - not as you were
<b>Floyd</b> | (indeed, much as your arch-rival appeared in fact.  Those players who
<b>Floyd</b> | recognise this similarity will smile knowingly, the rest will not have
<b>Floyd</b> | the resemblance pointed out.  I think it's fair to have the PC not

<b>Floyd</b> | comment; or perhaps just say "you look a lot like someone, but can't
<b>Floyd</b> | put your finger on who".  Or maybe we should just say:  "You are your
<b>Floyd</b> | arch-rival's clone!!!").  The PC is a little confused by this generally
<b>Floyd</b> | though (see note below about What The Machine Does Anyway).  At the top
<b>Floyd</b> | of the window is written, as spelt out by the PC, YRAUTROM.  The PC
<b>Floyd</b> | comments that he thought this was a place in Brazil.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So we escape from the room, by some device available - maybe smash the
<b>Floyd</b> | window with something, maybe just tug the door open, something simple
<b>Floyd</b> | anyway (I'm tempted by a finger-print scanner and a jar of pickled
<b>Floyd</b> | fingers, but it's a little too-sick I think).  He leaves, the door
<b>Floyd</b> | swings to behind him, and he reads "Oh - MORTUARY.  That would explain

<b>Floyd</b> | the large bullet-hole in your chest, then."  (Or however the PC's body
<b>Floyd</b> | died, see note below Slight Logical Flaw).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now we find ourselves in a room, with an obvious device of lethal
<b>Floyd</b> | capability - say, an extremely large pounding machine, with a circular
<b>Floyd</b> | pad and a touch button that makes it go, right next to the pad.  You

<b>Floyd</b> | can't touch the button from the ground (it's on the other side), player
<b>Floyd</b> | types "Stand on pad", we move the player to the pad and have him look
<b>Floyd</b> | up and take a look at the incredibly large metal smashing ball hovering
<b>Floyd</b> | a fair distance above your head.  Any player worth his salt is going to
<b>Floyd</b> | push the button, there and then.  The ball is deflected somehow,
<b>Floyd</b> | smashing open a wall through which you can go.  But the PC comments (as

<b>Floyd</b> | I said before in previous email) that "maybe if you destroy this body,
<b>Floyd</b> | you'll go back!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There's a problem here though; in that I'd rather have the player
<b>Floyd</b> | _want_ to kill himself already, not because he is led to believe it
<b>Floyd</b> | will wrap up the plot, but rather he is led to believe it will take him

<b>Floyd</b> | somewhere new (no player will fall for the idea of such a short game as
<b>Floyd</b> | the "here's the shotgun.  Kill yourself and win"; but if we convince
<b>Floyd</b> | the player he's about to leap somewhere new, then the Murphy's-Law
<b>Floyd</b> | effect will be a surprise when it occurs, and funny).  To this end, we
<b>Floyd</b> | make the map look like it's a dead-end, so that players don't wonder
<b>Floyd</b> | "what's through this door, along this corridor, up this air vent?", and

<b>Floyd</b> | decide that exploration is reversible and death is not.  The problem
<b>Floyd</b> | here is suggesting that killing yourself will do anything at all
<b>Floyd</b> | positive, though.  I've not got an answer to that yet, something
<b>Floyd</b> | clue/info needs to be dropped but I don't know what.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So an attempt fails, and the player is offered another (similarly

<b>Floyd</b> | restricted, we are still linear here).  On the third, I think our
<b>Floyd</b> | player will have realised that killing himself is not going to happen;
<b>Floyd</b> | and that he is being toyed with, so on the third failure we open the
<b>Floyd</b> | game world up and let the player into a larger area to explore.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now; the rules have shifted - the PC is quite convinced that he wants

<b>Floyd</b> | to do nothing so much as stick his head in an oven, but the player will
<b>Floyd</b> | be certain that it's not going to work (after all, why should it work
<b>Floyd</b> | now, why would the author allow it _now_, when he didn't earlier?)  So
<b>Floyd</b> | the aim here is for the player to come up with solutions to problems
<b>Floyd</b> | under the rule that they involve certain death - eg.  the gun-corridor:
<b>Floyd</b> | the player wants to solve it just to get through.  The PC wants to die.

<b>Floyd</b> | Together, we have a puzzle.  This area should be nice and wide,
<b>Floyd</b> | puzzle-wise, and now we drop some information as to where you are, who
<b>Floyd</b> | you are, and when you are.  Somewhere along the way you acquire a
<b>Floyd</b> | lab-coat to cover your (a) nakedness and (b) gaping hole in chest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The main feature of this area is a window, through which you can see

<b>Floyd</b> | the Experimental Machine - you are in the basement of your own lab,
<b>Floyd</b> | which the PC can comment he did know about, he had heard rumours they
<b>Floyd</b> | kept bodies for inspection here, but only ones they'd caused to be die.
<b>Floyd</b> | --- So we mention that the PC had heard a rumour that ARCH-RIVAL had
<b>Floyd</b> | been killed but he didn't believe it, especially what with him being in
<b>Floyd</b> | the experiment room at the start of the game.  We drop a load of hints

<b>Floyd</b> | about time-travel:  the day of the week, maybe, or the world event like
<b>Floyd</b> | you said:  someone mentions something in the first scene (and the PC
<b>Floyd</b> | mentions it again in passing, "Like that carnival yesterday night")
<b>Floyd</b> | which contrasts with a newspaper headline somewhere in the game ("The
<b>Floyd</b> | carnival planned for tonight...")  As before - the game tells us, but
<b>Floyd</b> | it is never stated.  --- I always feel, as soon as you state stuff, it

<b>Floyd</b> | becomes cheesier.  But then, I'm a little pathological like that, I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | told.  ;) Anyway, the player may realise that he is the ARCH-RIVAL'S
<b>Floyd</b> | dead Body, but the PC does not realise this for a second, he just
<b>Floyd</b> | carries merrily along, eyeing everything up in terms of its lethal
<b>Floyd</b> | capacity.  (eg.  "The newspaper is made of glossy paper, with almost
<b>Floyd</b> | razor-sharp edges".)  b Anyway, this gives the player something to aim

<b>Floyd</b> | for - that room with the machine in.  We have a succession of problems
<b>Floyd</b> | which come together to get you there; and then once there you are on a
<b>Floyd</b> | tight timer:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The PC comments that one of the major circuit boards is gone - "Someone
<b>Floyd</b> | must have sabotaged it!  ...  but it's okay, that board is backed up

<b>Floyd</b> | elsewhere..."  People are arriving through the door; people including
<b>Floyd</b> | your former self.  There is a fire-axe against the wall.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I don't know how we convince the player to smash the machine with the
<b>Floyd</b> | axe.  If he remembers the beginning like a true time-travel junkie
<b>Floyd</b> | he'll do it on instinct, and it'll be a nice

<b>Floyd</b> | player-guesses-random-thing-that-works-moment.  Otherwise, we could
<b>Floyd</b> | contrive something:- the people open the door, you instinctively duck
<b>Floyd</b> | to hide, knocking the fire axe off the wall.  It hits the machine,
<b>Floyd</b> | breaking it, bounces and as you pick it up they enter, seeing you with
<b>Floyd</b> | axe.  Then the machine is operated (in a chunk of text, there's nothing
<b>Floyd</b> | left for the player to do) and we have our ending.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So, how does this hold up?  Problems?  Things you don't like?  The
<b>Floyd</b> | important design ideas are:  We drip-feed information to the player and
<b>Floyd</b> | change his view throughout, rather than setting up a "here's the idea.
<b>Floyd</b> | go play" situation.  We make the PC quite dumb, for comic value.  We
<b>Floyd</b> | pull a last punch.  ;)

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Main problems I see:  How do we insinuate that suicide might prove
<b>Floyd</b> | useful in a continuation-sense rather than a concluding-sense?  How do
<b>Floyd</b> | we make the player want to sabotage his own machine at the end?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Jon

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | -----
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A few further notes:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What The Machine Does Anyway:- I'd like the player not to be told what

<b>Floyd</b> | the experimental machine is actually _for_.  There's no reason to
<b>Floyd</b> | include it in the intro - it can just be a "generic science artefact"
<b>Floyd</b> | and then come the end the player will have assumed we have conciousness
<b>Floyd</b> | transferal going on.  Then we could have a nice joke with PC casually
<b>Floyd</b> | mentioning toward the end that the machine's purpose is much more
<b>Floyd</b> | mundane - say, it fixes colour-blindness, perhaps.  Whatever.  It need

<b>Floyd</b> | not make too much sense; it's effectively just a one-liner.  There's no
<b>Floyd</b> | reason to be too pedantic on "realism"/"explanation", so long as the
<b>Floyd</b> | player is given adequate guidance at each stage of the game.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Slight Logical Flaw:- The player wakes up in a body which has died.
<b>Floyd</b> | Now, we ask what's killed it?  If it's anything external (so, as above,

<b>Floyd</b> | a bullet-wound in the heart) then the player is not going to think of
<b>Floyd</b> | killing the body because the body is clearly _not alive anyway_.  He's
<b>Floyd</b> | only going to consider hanging himself/poisoning himself/etc if the
<b>Floyd</b> | body actually has some appearance of functioning biologically.  In
<b>Floyd</b> | which case, what the hell did our body die of?  It ought to be clear
<b>Floyd</b> | that it _was dead at some point_ I think.  Perhaps we have a bullet

<b>Floyd</b> | wound, with the rest of the body "alive around it - you can feel a
<b>Floyd</b> | pulse, you're breathing, it's just that at some point in your chest
<b>Floyd</b> | pink fades to grey and there's this ragged hole.  Weird."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The setting is, uhm, set.

<b>Floyd</b> | Subject:  Re:  Game plans
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Okay, sounds like a plan.  I'll send Adam an email and follow it up
<b>Floyd</b> | with
<b>Floyd</b> | the $5.  I don't remember seeing any requirement for a synopsis, but

<b>Floyd</b> | I'll
<b>Floyd</b> | check his site again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;PS.  Not meaning to deluge, but I was thinking:  the one thing the
<b>Floyd</b> | game is
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;missing in its plans which is serious is some *sparkle*.  I think

<b>Floyd</b> | having a
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;unique setting is really important for making a game memorable and
<b>Floyd</b> | stick
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;in the head.  I usually make this up as I go along, but that's no good
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;under a collaborative setup, so I think we should try to think of

<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;something.  You know - set it on a lab under the sea, or on another
<b>Floyd</b> | planet,
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;or make all the characters telepaths, trying to invent machines to
<b>Floyd</b> | "Turn
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;off" their telepathy because they can't stand it any more.  Just

<b>Floyd</b> | something
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;to give the world a 'flavour', a shape and a look of its own.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When I read the 'lab' under the sea I had an immediate positive
<b>Floyd</b> | response.
<b>Floyd</b> | Plus we can invent a cool underwater vehicle for a scene and/or

<b>Floyd</b> | puzzle...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sorry for the duplicate email, server issues at work...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We never did brainstorm on the title of the game.  It stands now as

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Till Death Makes a Monk-Fish out of Me (or, TDMAMOOM).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm thinking the game needs a smaller title.  No, I don't have one ;)
<b>Floyd</b> | -- but I could start thinking of one.  I'm thinking about the last 5
<b>Floyd</b> | winners, most had one or two word titles (All Roads, Kaged, Winter

<b>Floyd</b> | Wonderland, Photopia, The Edifice) -- okay, that has *nothing* to do
<b>Floyd</b> | with them winning, but still...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I guess it goes to how our game will be reference in short (TDMAMOOM,
<b>Floyd</b> | Till Death, Monk-Fish, Death, that Squid game, etc...)

<b>Floyd</b> | Hi Mike -

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Congrats on finishing...  excellent stuff...  mail me a copy and I'll
<b>Floyd</b> | take a look on, um, Tuesday when I have a day free.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Title:  Hmm...  I must confess I've being thinking of the game as "till
<b>Floyd</b> | Death..."  and more ...  but I have a particular affinity with overlong

<b>Floyd</b> | titles (everywhere except IF that is, my edinburgh play is called
<b>Floyd</b> | "Abraham Lincoln and the Art of Faking It", for instance).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So...  I'll have a think and see what I come up with.  Something eight
<b>Floyd</b> | letters long or less has always been my yardstick, just for classic
<b>Floyd</b> | filename purposes (I always felt one problem with "Spider and Web" was

<b>Floyd</b> | no-one could find it in the archive!)
