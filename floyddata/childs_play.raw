The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Child's Play</i>, written by Stephen&nbsp;Granade.  <i>Child's Play</i> was originally released as part of the 2006 IntroComp, where it placed as the first runner-up. The first full version of the game, which is the version played by ClubFloyd, was released in December of 2007. You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Child%27s_Play"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

</br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | This is the middle of the living room, it is all big and vast. But it
<b>Floyd</b> | would be bigger and vaster if there weren't all these pillows and stuff
<b>Floyd</b> | in a big ring around you. The mom is totally all paranoid and whatever,
<b>Floyd</b> | she is a new mom.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | There is a red footstool, it looms over you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The mom is playing with you and is all excited about it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can also see a squishy ball, a plush book, and your favorite toy
<b>Floyd</b> | here.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You eye your favorite toy and the mom sees you doing it and scoops it
<b>Floyd</b> | up. "No, no, we're going to try pulling up!" She is all the time trying
<b>Floyd</b> | to build your character or something. She waves the toy at you. "Look!
<b>Floyd</b> | Look where I'm putting it!" She drops the toy on the footstool where
<b>Floyd</b> | you can't see it unless you're all pulled up, that is just no fair.

<b>Floyd</b> | Small Open Area
<b>Floyd</b> | You are east of the gliding rocking chair that is fun to ride on and

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | About half a parent high in the bookcase is your favorite toy.

<b>Floyd</b> | Part of your playpen is here, there is more of it to the southwest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can also see a squishy ball, a tall plastic block, a short plastic

<b>Floyd</b> | Playtime

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Right behind Marion and Zoe the little red haired girl is Lisa who is
<b>Floyd</b> | Cassie's mom. Lisa is carrying Cassie all carefully but Cassie is
<b>Floyd</b> | squirming to get down. "Hi Farina, hi Marion--hang on Cassie, mommy's
<b>Floyd</b> | going to put you down," Lisa says and then she steps over the baby gate
<b>Floyd</b> | and dumps Cassie by the couch to the south of you.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Meanwhile the mom is putting all the pillows back on the couch and
<b>Floyd</b> | loveseat. As she finishes she asks Marion, "Can I put this toy in Zoe's
<b>Floyd</b> | backpack for now?" Marion is all "Sure!" as she puts Zoe on the floor
<b>Floyd</b> | over by the rocking chair and sits on the loveseat.

<b>Floyd</b> | By the Rocking Chair

<b>Floyd</b> | The gliding rocking chair is all tall and wooden. It is where the mom
<b>Floyd</b> | rocks you when she thinks you need a nap even though you do not need
<b>Floyd</b> | naps. The loveseat is west and there is a small open area to the east

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A backpack with bears on and your favorite toy in it is shoved behind

<b>Floyd</b> | the rocking chair next to the wall[14].
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can also see a smooth rock here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Zoe is sitting in a fog of grump on the floor.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | There is a ding-dong! and the mom goes and opens the front door. It is
<b>Floyd</b> | Becca and her son Jemison and some strange guy is there holding Watson
<b>Floyd</b> | Mason. "Come on in, everyone," the mom says. She turns to the strange
<b>Floyd</b> | guy, "I'm glad you could make it, Parry[15]."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Parry shrugs and smiles and says, "I always wondered what everyone did

<b>Floyd</b> | during playgroup."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Drink mimosas[16]!" Becca says over her shoulder to Parry and there is
<b>Floyd</b> | polite laughter and Parry smiles like he is kinda unsure about all of
<b>Floyd</b> | this.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Why don't you put Watson in here with the others?" the mom asks and
<b>Floyd</b> | Parry nods. He ends up putting Watson by Jemison over by the loveseat.
<b>Floyd</b> | Then all the standing adults sit down with Parry sitting near you so

<b>Floyd</b> | just a second. You blink and blink and then you can see the mom holding
<b>Floyd</b> | the blanket she was covering you with. "Oh, kid, I'm so sorry, I
<b>Floyd</b> | thought you were having fun," she says. "We'll do something else."

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Middle of the Living Room

<b>Floyd</b> | This is the middle of the living room, it is all big and vast. But it
<b>Floyd</b> | would be bigger and vaster if there weren't all these pillows and stuff
<b>Floyd</b> | in a big ring around you. The mom is totally all paranoid and whatever,
<b>Floyd</b> | she is a new mom.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a red footstool, it looms over you.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The mom is playing with you and is all excited about it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can also see a squishy ball, a plush book, and your favorite toy
<b>Floyd</b> | here.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You eye your favorite toy and the mom sees you doing it and scoops it
<b>Floyd</b> | up. "No, no, we're going to try pulling up!" She is all the time trying
<b>Floyd</b> | to build your character or something. She waves the toy at you. "Look!
<b>Floyd</b> | Look where I'm putting it!" She drops the toy on the footstool where
<b>Floyd</b> | you can't see it unless you're all pulled up, that is just no fair.
