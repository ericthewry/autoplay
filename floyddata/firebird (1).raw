The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Firebird</i>, written by Bonnie&nbsp;Montgomery.  <i>Firebird</i> was originally released in 1998.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/86"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.</br>

<b>Floyd</b> | PREREQUISITES
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | None.  No special knowledge of Russian folklore is necessary to play
<b>Floyd</b> | the game or solve its not too difficult puzzles.  If you're familiar
<b>Floyd</b> | with some version of the Firebird legend, that may or may not help you
<b>Floyd</b> | along.  Scholars from Vladimir Propp to Joseph Campbell have observed
<b>Floyd</b> | that the basic plot of the hero's story is unvarying; the storyteller
<b>Floyd</b> | merely chooses from available motifs to fill in the framework.  Some of

<b>Floyd</b> | the motifs I've selected are traditionally Russian, others are anything
<b>Floyd</b> | but, making this story what I hope to be a fresh retelling.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | FREEWARE OR CHARITYWARE
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game is free.  I encourage you to share it with others, but you

<b>Floyd</b> | may not charge any money for it beyond the cost of the media it is
<b>Floyd</b> | stored on.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you enjoy "Firebird," please consider a monetary donation to a
<b>Floyd</b> | charitable organization to show your appreciation.  Here are some
<b>Floyd</b> | suggestions:

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    1.  An organization in your area that helps resettle Russian
<b>Floyd</b> | immigrants.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    2.  A local arts organization that has recently or will soon program
<b>Floyd</b> | Stravinsky's "Firebird Suite."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    3.  A donation to make the 36-inch Lick Telescope Dome accessible
<b>Floyd</b> | for classes, concerts, and visitor programs.  Make checks payable to UC
<b>Floyd</b> | Santa Cruz Foundation, 74 River Street, 1st Floor, Santa Cruz, CA, USA
<b>Floyd</b> | 95060-4593.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | See "PERSONAL NOTES" below to read why I suggest these causes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you do make a donation, I would love to learn what cause my work
<b>Floyd</b> | benefited.  Please send me an e-mail at firebird@pobox.com.  Of course,
<b>Floyd</b> | no matter what, I am happy to hear your comments and field your
<b>Floyd</b> | questions on "Firebird."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | First and foremost, thanks to my collaborator, friend, and husband,
<b>Floyd</b> | Chris Nebel.  He ably provided programming tutelage, debugging
<b>Floyd</b> | assistance, and advice on game design.  On those more than a few

<b>Floyd</b> | occasions when my imagination outstripped my programming abilities,
<b>Floyd</b> | Chris rolled up his sleeves and came up with the code that would make
<b>Floyd</b> | the story come alive as I intended.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks also to Dave Baggett, who has always greeted news of the game's
<b>Floyd</b> | progress with encouraging words.  Above and beyond the call of duty, he

<b>Floyd</b> | risked eyestrain one night playtesting the first beta as we traveled
<b>Floyd</b> | I-5 in California to a destination south of Tracy, north of Valencia.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My betatesters taught me so much in seeing the game through the
<b>Floyd</b> | player's eyes.  You really can't say you've written interactive fiction
<b>Floyd</b> | until your work has gone through playtesting.  Big thanks go to:

<b>Floyd</b> | PERSONAL NOTES
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | I began this game in the summer of 1994 after editing some program
<b>Floyd</b> | notes for the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra's performance of
<b>Floyd</b> | Stravinsky's "Firebird Suite."  To help in my research, Chris loaned me
<b>Floyd</b> | a book of Russian folk tales that had been a present from his
<b>Floyd</b> | grandparents.
<b>Floyd</b> |    As time passed, we learned more about how Russian folk tales had

<b>Floyd</b> | been a part of Chris's family history.  His maternal grandfather was an
<b>Floyd</b> | astronomer who immigrated from Russia.  During the 1930s, he was
<b>Floyd</b> | working atop Mount Hamilton overlooking California's Santa Clara Valley
<b>Floyd</b> | (now also known as Silicon Valley). He took an interest in the teacher
<b>Floyd</b> | who schooled the children living up there.  They spent many an evening
<b>Floyd</b> | telling and retelling these old Russian tales, and before long they

<b>Floyd</b> | were married.  Russian folk tales thus played a part both in their
<b>Floyd</b> | courtship and in ours.  What's more, circumstances have brought Chris
<b>Floyd</b> | and I from Maryland to Silicon Valley to live within sight of Mount
<b>Floyd</b> | Hamilton and the historic Lick Observatory.

<b>Floyd</b> |    Some days more than a dozen men wait on you to offer their greetings

<b>Floyd</b> |    You expect to see your masseur here, but instead there is an awfully
<b>Floyd</b> | goofy-looking fellow fooling with a floppy hat and fiddling with a fake
<b>Floyd</b> | mustache.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Your allergist is here, wanting to give you another in a series of

<b>Floyd</b> |    One of your father's pages is here.  He bows low, hands you a
<b>Floyd</b> | message, and announces that a groom is waiting with one of your fastest
<b>Floyd</b> | horses at an inn just north of here.  You brush him aside and turn your
<b>Floyd</b> | attention to the message, which reads:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "My dear son Ivan,

<b>Floyd</b> |    I have spent many a sleepless night contemplating the fate of this
<b>Floyd</b> | tsardom.  Who will inherit my reign?  Not Dimitri.  I sent him in
<b>Floyd</b> | search of the Firebird, and he returned to me without ever having laid
<b>Floyd</b> | eyes on the creature.  His current shame is richly justified in view of
<b>Floyd</b> | the minuscule effort he put into the task.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Your brother Vasilii's failure to capture the Firebird was perhaps

<b>Floyd</b> | even more disgraceful.  After having seen the Firebird, he did not
<b>Floyd</b> | persevere in his pursuit.
<b>Floyd</b> |    That leaves you as my final hope, the last son able to lay claim to
<b>Floyd</b> | the reign of this land.  I have feared that you would not be able to
<b>Floyd</b> | leave the well-tended gardens of your own thoughts long enough to
<b>Floyd</b> | accomplish any task I set before you.  If you are reading this message,

<b>Floyd</b> | then you have survived the two tests I arranged for you.  First, you
<b>Floyd</b> | have killed something, anything.  Second, you have had to outwit
<b>Floyd</b> | someone, anyone.  I am not at all convinced that you will succeed, but
<b>Floyd</b> | at least I feel confident now that you will not make me look like a
<b>Floyd</b> | complete fool to other tsars.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Son, if you bring the magical Firebird back to me, you will inherit

<b>Floyd</b> | my tsardom and have your choice of a bride.  If you fail and return to
<b>Floyd</b> | me alive, you will marry a noblewoman of MY choice.  I think you have
<b>Floyd</b> | some idea of the group from which I will pick.  Happy hunting!

<b>Floyd</b> |    It's you, the food-service peasants, and a long wooden table.

<b>Floyd</b> | poetry until it coughed up its innards?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    This is the caterer's most senior serving wench, Flo.  She's known

<b>Floyd</b> | has an opinion about everything you ever have or haven't done in your

<b>Floyd</b> | you think she deserves as the impudent peasant she is, but your father
<b>Floyd</b> | has always forbidden it.  He thinks some honest criticism is good for
<b>Floyd</b> | you, and he's never been in disagreement with Flo's opinions.  Oh, it
<b>Floyd</b> | would be good to be tsar and take a switch to her.
<b>Floyd</b> |    You keep your cool for now.  "Wench, I am embarking on a long

<b>Floyd</b> | journey.  I require these provisions:  two sandwiches, one roast beef
<b>Floyd</b> | on rye, one sprout and avocado on whole grain.  (You assume the

<b>Floyd</b> |    Vasilii pricks up his ears as he labors nearby.  "He's ALLERGIC to

<b>Floyd</b> | rice pudding," he thinks, eyeing you suspiciously.
<b>Floyd</b> |    As insulting as Flo can be, she would never disobey you.  In a few

<b>Floyd</b> |    You've left the forest and rivers behind you to the west.  The

<b>Floyd</b> |    You feel a sharp prick in your back and turn to find your brother
<b>Floyd</b> | Vasilii armed to the teeth with kitchen knives and ready to attack.

<b>Floyd</b> | You unsuccessfully try to hide the Firebird's feather.  "That's it!  I

<b>Floyd</b> | Katschei stepped out of the cloud and demanded that my father give me
<b>Floyd</b> | to him.  When my father refused, Katschei slew him, all my kinsmen, and

<b>Floyd</b> | captivity.  Please go on your way, sir, and do your best."  She starts

<b>Floyd</b> |    "A storm had blown up quickly, and a bolt of lightning struck the
<b>Floyd</b> | castle just outside the window to my bedchamber.  I covered myself and
<b>Floyd</b> | you to protect you from the loud crash of thunder, and when I looked
<b>Floyd</b> | up, a dark gigantic figure was perched on the windowsill.  It was
<b>Floyd</b> | Katschei.  He had ridden that thunderbolt into my chamber.  He seized
<b>Floyd</b> | me, and was about to jump out the window with both of us.  I had only a

<b>Floyd</b> | moment to act, and in that moment I threw you out of his grasp and onto
<b>Floyd</b> | a pile of blankets on the bed.  In an instant, he swept me away in a
<b>Floyd</b> | cloud.  The last thing I heard were your cries and screams."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Were you my wet nurse?"  you ask.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "No, I was...I am...your mother."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "But I was not a motherless child," you protest in confusion.

<b>Floyd</b> |    "To keep peace in the tsardom, your father brought in another woman
<b>Floyd</b> | to take my place in secret.  But I am your mother.  Truly."  A tear
<b>Floyd</b> | forms in the corner of her eye.  "After Katschei had transformed me
<b>Floyd</b> | into a firebird, he made me his thief:  I was sent to steal for him all
<b>Floyd</b> | the copper and silver and gold and pearl that nine times nine tsardoms
<b>Floyd</b> | possessed.  I have been very busy all these years.  As much as I could,

<b>Floyd</b> | I visited your father's garden, in hope that he would start sending you
<b>Floyd</b> | boys out to capture me.  Dimitri was soon old enough to be given the
<b>Floyd</b> | task.  But I wouldn't be found so easily by him, or by Vasilii.
<b>Floyd</b> | Although I love them, I wanted you to be the one to rescue me.  Because

<b>Floyd</b> |    The walls, the ceiling, and nearly all the objects in the room are
<b>Floyd</b> | covered in row upon row of perfectly round, white pearls.  It is a
<b>Floyd</b> | monochromatic, pixellated visual nightmare.  The only architectural

<b>Floyd</b> | features that relieve the monotony are at the far end of the room:  a
<b>Floyd</b> | door frame and doorknob covered in black pearls.
<b>Floyd</b> |    The room's single occupant takes you out of the nightmare and into a
<b>Floyd</b> | dream.  A young woman is here, as beautiful to you as Venus emerging
<b>Floyd</b> | out of the ocean from an oyster.  Out of the hundreds of thousands of
<b>Floyd</b> | pearls in this room, she is indeed the only one of great price.  Her

<b>Floyd</b> | loveliness has made you speechless. She is also silent at first,
<b>Floyd</b> | studying you intently.  "I do not know who you are, sir, but you must
<b>Floyd</b> | be very clever and very brave to have made your way to my chamber.
<b>Floyd</b> | What is your name?"  she asks.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Ivan," you almost whisper, still taking her in.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "I am Pearl," she laughs.  "That is the name Katschei gave me.  I

<b>Floyd</b> | don't know what my parents called me."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Then Katschei brought you here when you were very young?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "As an infant, I imagine.  I do not know a time when I was not
<b>Floyd</b> | here."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Then how do you know he is not your father?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Because he has always boasted that he took me from a tsar and a

<b>Floyd</b> | tsarina.  The only child they ever had, he says.  He claims that he was
<b>Floyd</b> | a suitor to my mother, but she rejected him, so many years later he
<b>Floyd</b> | stole me to be raised as his bride."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Did he raise you himself?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Oh, no.  There were many nurses and governesses and tutors here
<b>Floyd</b> | when I was a child.  But as the days grow closer to our wedding, he has

<b>Floyd</b> | been guarding me very closely, and no one is here except him and his
<b>Floyd</b> | knights."  She motions toward the door leading further into the palace.
<b>Floyd</b> | You both hear the gruff laughter of battle-toughened men.  "He raised
<b>Floyd</b> | me to be his ideal bride, but I think he did a very poor job.  I cannot
<b>Floyd</b> | abide him."
<b>Floyd</b> |    Seeing her gentleness you have no trouble believing this.  You press

<b>Floyd</b> | on to a more curious subject.  "Is Katschei a bird?  Does he want a
<b>Floyd</b> | bird bride?"  You have only recently noticed her wings and lower body
<b>Floyd</b> | are that of a bird.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "This is a recent transfiguration.  He placed me in this form to
<b>Floyd</b> | make me undesirable to any man who might try to steal me from him."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Once again, he did a poor job."  She turns her eyes away modestly

<b>Floyd</b> | from you and your amorous words.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "If you do wish to spoil his wedding plans, I will tell you another
<b>Floyd</b> | of Katschei's failings."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Please do tell me."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "He chose to confide in me the secret of his immortality and
<b>Floyd</b> | strength."

<b>Floyd</b> |    "Is this the secret of where his soul is kept?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Yes.  How do you know so much already?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    You tell her about the Firebird and the other two captive birds and
<b>Floyd</b> | what they have revealed to you.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "It is all true.  His body is imperishable.  His soul is in an egg,
<b>Floyd</b> | a quite well-hidden egg.  The egg is in a duck, and the duck is in a

<b>Floyd</b> | hare, and the hare nests in a great hollow log that floats in a pond in
<b>Floyd</b> | a forest of the island Bouyan.  I wish I could tell you where to find
<b>Floyd</b> | the island, but I do not know that."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Very curiously hidden.  And say I retrieved the egg.  Would simply
<b>Floyd</b> | breaking it destroy Katschei?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Yes, but it must be broken in his sight.  You must find the egg and

<b>Floyd</b> | return. Katschei is very likely to be here feasting with his knights.
<b>Floyd</b> | You may have to fight the knights to reach him, so be sure to come
<b>Floyd</b> | ready for battle."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "I will do as you say, as swiftly as I can."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Please do be swift.  The wedding is approaching very quickly."  She
<b>Floyd</b> | shows you her wedding gown, which she is decorating very delicately

<b>Floyd</b> | with pearls.  You wonder aloud how she can do it at all with those
<b>Floyd</b> | wings.  "With much difficulty," she answers with a smile.
<b>Floyd</b> |    You resolve aloud to return with the egg as soon as you can.  In
<b>Floyd</b> | your own thoughts you swear very solemnly not to let Katschei touch
<b>Floyd</b> | this unspoiled beauty.

<b>Floyd</b> | True to his word, Vasilii has returned with help:  a dozen strong,

<b>Floyd</b> |    You suppress a sudden urge to rant.  "Vasilii?  A word with you,
<b>Floyd</b> | please?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "What?  I know, the sushi knives are a bit much, but they wouldn't
<b>Floyd</b> | leave without them."  He notices your look.  "All right, all right!  I
<b>Floyd</b> | know what you're thinking, but I'm serious!  You haven't seen them

<b>Floyd</b> | train!  There's nothing like it!"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Vasilii," you explain patiently, "they're CHEFS.  They prepare
<b>Floyd</b> | FOOD.  I mean, what are they going to do--grind pepper into the
<b>Floyd</b> | knights' eyes to blind them, then carve them into neat little filets
<b>Floyd</b> | and serve them with a spicy ginger sauce?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    You hadn't realized the chefs were listening, but there is a sudden

<b>Floyd</b> | flurry of conversation among them.  One steps forward.  "An excellent
<b>Floyd</b> | strategy, koutaishi-sama," he proclaims in a thick Japanese accent.
<b>Floyd</b> | "With you leading us, we must be victory!"
<b>Floyd</b> |    You try not to roll your eyes as you put on your best

<b>Floyd</b> | maybe--just maybe--these teppanyaki chefs will be up to the job.  "All

<b>Floyd</b> | right, everyone," you announce loudly, "we've got a wizard to kill.

<b>Floyd</b> | In the Great Hall of the Pearl Palace
<b>Floyd</b> |    Katschei's great hall is a place of feasting and boasting.

<b>Floyd</b> |    Katschei is at the head of the long banquet table, separated from
<b>Floyd</b> | you by his legion of knights that flank him on either side.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Three times nine of Katschei's most battle-tested knights [6] have
<b>Floyd</b> | gathered in this hall to feast and to defend their lord.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your brother Vasilii follows you.  The chefs follow you.  You stand

<b>Floyd</b> | proudly to face the knights and Katschei with your formidable army.
<b>Floyd</b> | The chefs surround you, faces set with fiercesome expressions and their
<b>Floyd</b> | cutlery held in ceremonial battle stances.  The knights are somewhat
<b>Floyd</b> | confused at the purpose of this arriving force.
<b>Floyd</b> |    "Are you bringing the next course?"  Katschei sputters.
<b>Floyd</b> |    At once a chef screams out in Japanese:  "Pepper shower attack!"

<b>Floyd</b> | (Vasilii is at your elbow to translate.)  The chefs pull out their
<b>Floyd</b> | pepper mills, leap onto the table, and, with aggressive grinding
<b>Floyd</b> | action, fill their opponents' eyes with a shower of ground pepper.
<b>Floyd</b> |    The knights leap up, lurching about, trying to find their footing
<b>Floyd</b> | and their weaponry through the stinging pain in their peppery eyes.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Another chef cries:  "Teppanyaki Technique--Perfected!"  Another:

<b>Floyd</b> | "Ginger Final Attack!"  (again, according to Vasilii's translation).
<b>Floyd</b> | Most of the chefs go to work with their cutlery:  the first wave with
<b>Floyd</b> | giant cleavers, hacking off limbs.  The second wave moves in with the
<b>Floyd</b> | carving knives, flaying off large slices of knight flesh.  A third
<b>Floyd</b> | group takes on the fine slicing.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Meanwhile, the "special forces" are preparing the final attack.

<b>Floyd</b> | They have set up some pots on makeshift fires and pull from their bags
<b>Floyd</b> | long ginger roots, bottles of rice vinegar, and other condiments.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | finished flesh is tossed from one set of chefs to the cooking team, who
<b>Floyd</b> | are giving the meat a quick marinade in the sauce.
<b>Floyd</b> |    When all of the knights have been disabled, the chefs start
<b>Floyd</b> | chanting, "kuroi tamago, kuroi tamago!"  Vasilii leans over to you, "I

<b>Floyd</b> | think they mean it's time to break the egg, Ivan."

<b>Floyd</b> |    You slam the egg to the ground with tremendous force.  As it
<b>Floyd</b> | shatters, Katschei recoils in horror, his eyes turning back in his

<b>Floyd</b> | wind begins to blow you around like a piece of paper.  You are lost in
<b>Floyd</b> | this kaleidoscope maelstrom for a timeless interval.  Suddenly, all is
<b>Floyd</b> | quiet and dark.  A moment later, you hear the chatter of happy voices
<b>Floyd</b> | around you.  You open your eyes and discover that you are now in ...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Cathedral of Our Lady
<b>Floyd</b> |    You are in a magnificent yet completely familiar place.  You have
<b>Floyd</b> | known the Cathedral of Our Lady since you were very small.  You have
<b>Floyd</b> | marveled at the grandness of the architecture and taken comfort in the
<b>Floyd</b> | small gestures of the priest in preparing the host for communion.

<b>Floyd</b> | Today the nave is even more beautiful to behold.  Swags of greens hang
<b>Floyd</b> | between the columns, and flowers have been banked up around the altar
<b>Floyd</b> | in abundance.  You don't think this is a major feast day.  When you
<b>Floyd</b> | look around at who else is there, however, you start to get an idea of
<b>Floyd</b> | what celebration is intended.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Vasilii is at your side, gawking in amazement at the woman standing
<b>Floyd</b> | next to your father.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It's Mom!"  Vasilii exclaims.  You had left out that one piece of
<b>Floyd</b> | information in relating to Vasilii what had happened inside the
<b>Floyd</b> | palaces.  She is no longer the Firebird, no longer a bird at all; now

<b>Floyd</b> | she will only be your little mother. She approaches and embraces you
<b>Floyd</b> | both.  "Thank you, my boys," she whispers through tears.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your father comes up to greet you.  "Ivan," he exclaims, wrapping you
<b>Floyd</b> | in his embrace, "you've done it.  Destroyed Katschei and returned your
<b>Floyd</b> | mother to us."

<b>Floyd</b> |    "And Vasilii!  Did you aid your brother in battle?"  Vasilii tells
<b>Floyd</b> | your dad all about the great teppanyaki battle.  "Um... yes, my boy.
<b>Floyd</b> | Very clever thinking.  I must admit that this time you got it right."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your parents are gesturing for you to look behind you.  Pearl!  She too
<b>Floyd</b> | is freed of her bird form, but couldn't be any lovelier than the

<b>Floyd</b> | creature you beheld at first sight.  She is wearing the wedding gown
<b>Floyd</b> | you saw her working on in the ante chamber.  "I finished it finally,"
<b>Floyd</b> | she says.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Alongside her is a young woman whose arms you already know, but whose
<b>Floyd</b> | face is new.  She was the captive of the copper palace, now freed of

<b>Floyd</b> | her avian shackles.  You greet her and attempt to introduce her to
<b>Floyd</b> | Pearl.  "But I don't know your name," you confess.  "I am Copper," she
<b>Floyd</b> | replies.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A girl in a silvery gown is standing on the other side of Pearl.  You
<b>Floyd</b> | cannot see her feet under her gown, but you imagine she was the bird

<b>Floyd</b> | captive in the silver palace.  She gives you a wink.  Yes, that's her.
<b>Floyd</b> | "And would you be Silver?"  you ask her.  "Yes, indeed, sugar!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your brother Dimitri is here, no longer incognito.  You can't tell yet
<b>Floyd</b> | whether he's noticed your mother.  Your allergist is at Dimitri's side,
<b>Floyd</b> | trying to help him focus on the most important details of the scene.

<b>Floyd</b> | Dimitri is more than a little bit unfocused.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The head caterer has just come in from outside, where he is supervising
<b>Floyd</b> | his staff in the preparation of a feast.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The caterer's young serving wench is right behind him.  She runs past

<b>Floyd</b> | the caterer and straight up to Pearl.  She bows low.  "My lady, I look
<b>Floyd</b> | like a serving girl, but I am in fact your younger sister, Elena."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "How can that be?  My parents had but one child!"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "They were successful then in keeping my birth a secret from
<b>Floyd</b> | Katschei."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "How did you come to this tsardom and to this low position?"

<b>Floyd</b> |    "When I was old enough, I asked our parents' permission to go off
<b>Floyd</b> | and search for you.  They would not allow a girl to adventure, even for
<b>Floyd</b> | as noble a task.  So I disguised myself as a peasant and escaped one
<b>Floyd</b> | night."
<b>Floyd</b> |    "But you were not able to find me?"
<b>Floyd</b> |    "I had found Katschei's mountain and a route through the wilderness

<b>Floyd</b> | from the forest by the time I heard that Ivan was being sent on the
<b>Floyd</b> | task.  When Vasilii told me he was going to find Ivan, I told him my
<b>Floyd</b> | route to the steppe."
<b>Floyd</b> |    You overhear their conversation.  "So that's how Vasilii was able to
<b>Floyd</b> | sneak up on me!"  you think to yourself.
<b>Floyd</b> |    There is no doubting that Pearl and Elena are sisters, so strong is

<b>Floyd</b> | the resemblance.  Pearl introduces you.  "Ivan, without Elena I would
<b>Floyd</b> | have never been able to find my parents again."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Flo is here, dressed in her peasant best, beaming at you with
<b>Floyd</b> | uncharacteristic pride.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The teppanyaki chefs are here, gathered around a big pile of rags.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's no pile of rags:  it's the baba yaga from the forest!  She is
<b>Floyd</b> | using her magical bag as a gift-wrapping service.  You can hear her
<b>Floyd</b> | schtick all the way from the front of the church:  "You may put
<b>Floyd</b> | whatever you dare in the bag.  Choose carefully, my friends, for what

<b>Floyd</b> | you put in the bag will never again be what it was."  This is not
<b>Floyd</b> | scaring the teppanyaki chefs much; they really only understand
<b>Floyd</b> | Japanese, and the results are not very frightening; only gaily wrapped
<b>Floyd</b> | presents are emerging from the bag.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, the archbishop of your father's tsardom is standing at the

<b>Floyd</b> | altar.  A tall elder with a long white beard, he is dressed today in
<b>Floyd</b> | his best ceremonial robes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | *** Your score just went up by 3 points.  ***
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your father takes you by the arm and mounts the few steps to the altar.

<b>Floyd</b> | He calls for attention and instantly commands it.  "Subjects, this is a
<b>Floyd</b> | joyous day for me and for the tsardom.  My son, Ivan, has destroyed the
<b>Floyd</b> | wizard Katschei and freed his captives.  One of the women held captive
<b>Floyd</b> | was his mother, my wife. The others were all daughters stolen from the
<b>Floyd</b> | rulers of nearby tsardoms, who will also rejoice when they hear this
<b>Floyd</b> | news.  To celebrate this occasion, I announce the betrothal of Ivan to

<b>Floyd</b> | Katschei's bride-to-be, Pearl.  Ivan, you and Pearl will be tsar and
<b>Floyd</b> | tsarina over this tsardom in three years' time.  As the first privilege
<b>Floyd</b> | I will grant you as future tsar, you may choose a wife for each of your
<b>Floyd</b> | brothers."  [7]

<b>Floyd</b> | Sometime This Century:  Your Wedding
<b>Floyd</b> |    You are in a magnificent yet completely familiar place.  You have
<b>Floyd</b> | known the Cathedral of Our Lady since you were very small.  You have
<b>Floyd</b> | marveled at the grandness of the architecture and taken comfort in the

<b>Floyd</b> | small gestures of the priest in preparing the host for communion.
<b>Floyd</b> | Today the nave is even more beautiful to behold.  Swags of greens hang
<b>Floyd</b> | between the columns, and flowers have been banked up around the altar
<b>Floyd</b> | in abundance.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Your brother Vasilii is here.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Your mother, the former Firebird, is here, joyful in her return to

<b>Floyd</b> | her place as tsarina and as your mother.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Your father is here, proud at witnessing your success and joyful
<b>Floyd</b> | that his wife has been returned to him.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Pearl is standing near the altar, flanked by the girls who had been
<b>Floyd</b> | held captive in the copper and silver palaces.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Copper is here, conversing quietly with Silver and Pearl.

<b>Floyd</b> |    Silver is very animated in her conversation with the other two
<b>Floyd</b> | girls.  She's certainly not a shy person.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Dimitri is here, a little overstimulated by all the people and the
<b>Floyd</b> | surroundings.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Your allergist is here trying to focus Dimitri's attention on the
<b>Floyd</b> | momentous events occurring in this room.

<b>Floyd</b> |    The caterer is taking a break from his preparations outside to see
<b>Floyd</b> | how events are progressing in the cathedral.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Elena is here, a tsar's daughter (and Pearl's sister) in the
<b>Floyd</b> | disguise of a serving wench.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Flo is here, dressed in her peasant best, beaming at you with
<b>Floyd</b> | uncharacteristic pride.

<b>Floyd</b> |    The teppanyaki chefs are fascinated by the baba yaga's magical bag.
<b>Floyd</b> | They are taking turns putting their battle knives and pepper mills into
<b>Floyd</b> | the bag to give them to you as wedding presents.  You sincerely hope
<b>Floyd</b> | that they are wiping them off first.
<b>Floyd</b> |    The baba yaga is here, using her magical bag as a gift-wrapping
<b>Floyd</b> | service.

<b>Floyd</b> |    The archbishop is here, waiting to start the wedding mass.
