					<span class="fontish smaller">The idea behind ClubFloyd
						is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of 
						people meet online to cooperatively play a game of 
						interactive fiction.<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Andromeda Dreaming</em> written by Joey Jones.
						<I>Andromeda Dreaming</I> was released as part of the The Andromeda Legacyâ„¢ Competition, in which it took first place.

<b>Floyd</b> | You awake in Bunk C of Pod 19-Q, in the Morbozzo space station,
<b>Floyd</b> | location unknown. It's a narrow cylinder, big enough for one person to
<b>Floyd</b> | float in, with four bunks. You must have been shuttled in through the
<b>Floyd</b> | airlock on one end; the other end is taken up by a huge screen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Across the pod, a bearded man leans out of Bunk A, staring avidly at
<b>Floyd</b> | the screen.

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | &gt;Welcome to Andromeda Dreaming, a sequel to Marco Innocenti's Andromeda
<b>Floyd</b> | Awakening made for The Andromeda Legacy" competition. Knowledge of
<b>Floyd</b> | Andromeda Awakening might make the game more fun or understandable but
<b>Floyd</b> | isn't strictly necessary for understanding the plot.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you spot any bugs or typos or just want some lucid dreaming tips,
<b>Floyd</b> | send me an email at notquitethere@gmail.com.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hints:
<b>Floyd</b> | Though all the usual things are accepted, the game can in fact be
<b>Floyd</b> | played in its entirety through just six commands: look (at), sleep,
<b>Floyd</b> | wake, touch, remove, and talk to. Other commands like listen and switch
<b>Floyd</b> | on may be helpful.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks goes to:
<b>Floyd</b> | Marco Innocenti AKA James P. King
<b>Floyd</b> | All the wonderful people behind Inform and its extensions
<b>Floyd</b> | Jenny Roomy
