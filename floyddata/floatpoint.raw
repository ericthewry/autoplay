The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Floatpoint</i>, written by Emily Short.  <i>Floatpoint</i> was originally released as part of the 2006 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took first place. It went on to be nominated for five Xyzzy Awards, including Best Game, Best Writing, and Best Individual Puzzle, and ultimately winning the Xyzzies for Best Setting and Best NPCs.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Floatpoint"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

</br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | Lakeshore
<b>Floyd</b> | When Aleheart Colony was choosing landing spots, Cordia Peak was deemed
<b>Floyd</b> | a good source of geothermal and hydroelectric energy. This lake, snug
<b>Floyd</b> | under the mountain, is the oldest manmade thing on the planet; you have
<b>Floyd</b> | a poster of it at home.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | In the early pictures, the lake is whitish, silty water in a bowl of
<b>Floyd</b> | bare rock, fed by a trickle of glacial runoff, and dammed at the south
<b>Floyd</b> | end with concrete. Now it is deep blue. The glacier has progressed so
<b>Floyd</b> | far that it forms a wall across the north end of the lake, tall enough
<b>Floyd</b> | to block any view of Cordia Peak except the summit. Icebergs float on
<b>Floyd</b> | the water. Fine black grass, rippled like velvet, grows on the bank. At

<b>Floyd</b> | the south end, the concrete too is gone; the water simply seems to
<b>Floyd</b> | stop.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The arc of Aleheart's ring system crosses the southern sky, much the
<b>Floyd</b> | same pale white as the moon in daytime.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | A narrow path climbs west through a low point in the ridge and
<b>Floyd</b> | continues along the face of the glacier towards town.

<b>Floyd</b> | A flash of memory: Kruger has turned his chair toward the window and

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You start to comment, but he goes on. "And your future boss is insane
<b>Floyd</b> | and a genius and needs watching. I know you're too senior to be
<b>Floyd</b> | someone's lackey. But these are not normal circumstances."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What you heard on the way here was more worrying: anecdotes that

<b>Floyd</b> | that he was in love with a native woman; that a native man was in love

<b>Floyd</b> | That he was human, but had been talking with a native scientist about a

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Kruger's last message didn't reach you until you were in orbit here:
<b>Floyd</b> | that you were not to be a lackey after all; that you were to take over
<b>Floyd</b> | the job of ambassador yourself. "Valenti has been notified," he said.

<b>Floyd</b> | with the shape and height of oak trunks. There is a staircase up, and
<b>Floyd</b> | some other exits north and west, which look more like things to

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | At the south end is a door to what looks like a private room.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A young ayamet is waiting at the center of the room -- studiedly
<b>Floyd</b> | looking at something in his hand, trying to wait without seeming to do
<b>Floyd</b> | so. This will be Liam the assistant, then.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | He turns: his face is elfin and slightly furred. "Greetings,
<b>Floyd</b> | ambassador. Welcome to Aleheart."  His English is oddly accentuated,
<b>Floyd</b> | almost sung. He does not extend a hand, but you would not have expected
<b>Floyd</b> | him to touch you: some things are too much a taboo to overcome, even in
<b>Floyd</b> | deference to Earth manners.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "You've just been meeting Ambassador Valenti, I think?" he adds. "I
<b>Floyd</b> | hope it was a productive encounter. You must have had questions for
<b>Floyd</b> | him."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The smile is so bland. This might be a dart at your inexperience, or at
<b>Floyd</b> | Valenti for being naturally unhelpful. Or it might be nothing at all.

<b>Floyd</b> | But the grey widget trembles eagerly in your hand. It catches Liam's

<b>Floyd</b> | My dear unfortunate successor:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Possibly Kruger didn't tell you the importance of Gift Day. What you
<b>Floyd</b> | offer shows our intentions towards the colony. To date, Earth has made
<b>Floyd</b> | inappropriate or deceptive gestures thirteen times. They do employment
<b>Floyd</b> | here by running vote, and Ambassador Aylene is about to be removed

<b>Floyd</b> | because she hasn't gotten a good result out of us. You guess whose
<b>Floyd</b> | fault that is.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Fate of negotiations is now in your hands. Ultimate responsibility:
<b>Floyd</b> | yours. Kruger can't control what you do from Earth.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | He's probably told you to wear red. This is a mistake: it would allow
<b>Floyd</b> | the colonists to come to Earth as our adoptees and put us in a position
<b>Floyd</b> | of power over them. This is neither morally nor pragmatically
<b>Floyd</b> | defensible.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Recommend that you wear white -- it is a color associated with

<b>Floyd</b> | equality. I have a white jacket; it's possible Liam has taken it away,
<b>Floyd</b> | in which case you should get it back from him. I threw out the receipt,
<b>Floyd</b> | but it may still be in the recycling chute, if that helps communicate
<b>Floyd</b> | your needs.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Do not know what Kruger will have told you to give in the gift box, but

<b>Floyd</b> | if you haven't already done so, recommend you look up "gifts" in the
<b>Floyd</b> | computer. It has an etiquette guide. This should give some idea what
<b>Floyd</b> | he's getting you into.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When you are ready to present your gift, summon Liam and show him the
<b>Floyd</b> | gift box. He will arrange the meeting for you.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Yours in haste, Valenti
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Mentally you check off "check your messages again" on your list of
<b>Floyd</b> | remaining tasks. You run over the things various people have decided
<b>Floyd</b> | you ought to do:

<b>Floyd</b> |   find jacket receipt in the recycling chute (Valenti's suggestion)
<b>Floyd</b> |   acquire vaccine from the Museum (HC's orders)
<b>Floyd</b> |   wear white jacket (Valenti's idea)
<b>Floyd</b> |   look up gifts in the computer (Valenti's suggestion)

<b>Floyd</b> | may go insane...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | three months ago: I tried asking her whether she can factor in my
<b>Floyd</b> | thoughts the same way her little live rock tracks everyone else's. She
<b>Floyd</b> | said no, I don't broadcast. She looked tremendously uncomfortable. I
<b>Floyd</b> | cannot say how smug this makes me.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | eight months ago: Met my counterpart, the ambassador Aylene, today.

<b>Floyd</b> | Frankly, High Command should have left Yamashita here -- they probably
<b>Floyd</b> | did wonderfully having tea parties together and comparing fashion
<b>Floyd</b> | notes. Have never met another human -- no, strike that, because she
<b>Floyd</b> | isn't human. Have never met any person with so little emotional affect
<b>Floyd</b> | in speech and behavior. Not sure what gene modifications they made to
<b>Floyd</b> | her, but it is frightening.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | five months ago: Coming to terms with the bowing. When Aylene bows,
<b>Floyd</b> | when she smiles, when she says polite formulas, the etiquette system
<b>Floyd</b> | doesn't seem stupid.  She's not bowing to show how well-bred she is.
<b>Floyd</b> | It's a liturgy of respect.  You bow to show that you respect someone
<b>Floyd</b> | but also to remind yourself of this fact. Sincerity can work inward as

<b>Floyd</b> | well as outward. You don't have to like someone to treat them well. If
<b>Floyd</b> | you practice this sometimes leads to liking.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then again, sometimes not.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | five weeks ago: Is it possible that Liam is jealous of me because of

<b>Floyd</b> | Aylene? I find him lurking around after she's been here, looking sniffy
<b>Floyd</b> | and grim. Naturally Aylene's live rock doesn't offer any sort of data
<b>Floyd</b> | analysis function. That might be dangerously useful.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | four weeks ago: Another long, long talk with Aylene.  She may be coming
<b>Floyd</b> | around on the cohabitation idea, of shared resources and an integrated

<b>Floyd</b> | society.  But there are concessions involved on both sides, and she is
<b>Floyd</b> | more afraid of her people than I am of mine.  There's no way they're
<b>Floyd</b> | going to be able to live on Earth and preserve their daintiness about
<b>Floyd</b> | eating, for instance.  Which in my opinion would be no bad thing, but
<b>Floyd</b> | one can hardly say that...
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | 28 days ago: Naturally after I read that I asked Aylene about it (if
<b>Floyd</b> | we're modeling our alliance on a marriage I'd rather not have
<b>Floyd</b> | "marriage" mean "eugenics program"). She says in practice there's
<b>Floyd</b> | hardly any "flushing".  I still have some serious questions about this,
<b>Floyd</b> | but I think inasmuch as it applies to the current occasion we're
<b>Floyd</b> | looking rather at a joint stewardship of the resources available to

<b>Floyd</b> | both planets.  HC should be able to live with that.  I don't know
<b>Floyd</b> | whether the general population would be so enthusiastic, but the
<b>Floyd</b> | general population seems to think it's a point of principle not to make
<b>Floyd</b> | any concessions or in fact live in the real world in any way.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 25 days ago: And, well, the personal component of all this.  I very

<b>Floyd</b> | nearly put it to Aylene as an offer based on symbolism and political
<b>Floyd</b> | expediency.  She would have understood that, but... I would like to
<b>Floyd</b> | marry her, in truth, and not simply as a means to an end.  She was
<b>Floyd</b> | silent after I raised the possibility.  I think I went about it wrong,
<b>Floyd</b> | but it's damned difficult to know what "right" looks like here.  How
<b>Floyd</b> | the hell would I know?

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 24 days ago: She won't talk to me today.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 23 days ago: They voted her out. I cannot believe they voted her out.
<b>Floyd</b> | What kind of employment system is that, anyway?
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | 5 days ago: News from Kruger: I am out. No explanation. Replacement
<b>Floyd</b> | already en route. Pack bags, prepare to leave. Can't bring myself to
<b>Floyd</b> | contact Aylene.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Museum is a presentation on Earth -- geography, culture, and

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To one side there is a ramp leading down. The studious way the crowd

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A map of Earth covers the east wall, so large that you can barely reach

<b>Floyd</b> | across South America with both arms outstretched. It has attracted
<b>Floyd</b> | several groups of interested visitors, who are pointing out to each

<b>Floyd</b> | gift symbolism: draft proposal: According to the etiquette files, those

<b>Floyd</b> | proposing marriage or cooperative scientific ventures may do so by
<b>Floyd</b> | creating a sample of the kind of project they hope to undertake. In the
<b>Floyd</b> | case of marriage, these are usually representations of the offspring
<b>Floyd</b> | that might be engineered from the two parents; for purely business
<b>Floyd</b> | relationships, other kinds of model, sample, or technical proposal are
<b>Floyd</b> | appropriate. A superior looking to employ or adopt an inferior may give

<b>Floyd</b> | a sample of the kind of work the inferior will be expected to produce
<b>Floyd</b> | as a condition of the employment.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | gift symbolism: personal token: Etiquette files reveal that an object
<b>Floyd</b> | personally significant to the giver is an appropriate gift when
<b>Floyd</b> | establishing a relationship of friendship in which no joint work or

<b>Floyd</b> | project is intended. Also sometimes used for marriages not intended to
<b>Floyd</b> | produce offspring.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | gift symbolism: knife: Apparently, according to the etiquette files,
<b>Floyd</b> | any edged instrument is a symbol of restrictions, living under strict
<b>Floyd</b> | controls imposed by someone else, and dating back to clinical trials in

<b>Floyd</b> | which new genetic lines deemed to be failing their intended purpose
<b>Floyd</b> | were slaughtered with a knife. This practice is now called flushing and
<b>Floyd</b> | does not require a blade, but the associations remain.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your search turns up the following entries from Valenti's personal log:
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | six months ago: Have been making progress with the translations of
<b>Floyd</b> | etiquette guide... much appears to center upon proposals of various
<b>Floyd</b> | kinds.  I have gathered the formal proposal system they're using on us
<b>Floyd</b> | is not (contrary to what they might say) a frequent feature of daily
<b>Floyd</b> | life for them either, but is rather some archaic bit of hazing they got
<b>Floyd</b> | out of mothballs.  As a test, maybe.  Or maybe because the symbols and

<b>Floyd</b> | terms of it are actually, God help us, simpler than communicating all
<b>Floyd</b> | the nuances in their language.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | seven weeks ago: Liam told me about the flint knife in the Earth
<b>Floyd</b> | Sanctuary. Turns out it wasn't brought by us (always thought that a
<b>Floyd</b> | really odd thing to send) but they brought it here from Earth

<b>Floyd</b> | themselves. There's some sort of gloomy symbolism there which, as
<b>Floyd</b> | usual, he couldn't bring himself to explain directly. A less useful
<b>Floyd</b> | assistant would be difficult to find.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 25 days ago: And, well, the personal component of all this.  I very
<b>Floyd</b> | nearly put it to Aylene as an offer based on symbolism and political

<b>Floyd</b> | expediency.  She would have understood that, but... I would like to
<b>Floyd</b> | marry her, in truth, and not simply as a means to an end.  She was
<b>Floyd</b> | silent after I raised the possibility.  I think I went about it wrong,
<b>Floyd</b> | but it's damned difficult to know what "right" looks like here.  How

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your search turns up the following entries from Valenti's personal log:

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | seven months ago: God. Where to begin? Liam would not be assigned this
<b>Floyd</b> | -- as I discover -- extremely low-ranking position as my assistant if
<b>Floyd</b> | he had turned out to be good at any of the traditional skills, such as
<b>Floyd</b> | manufacturing birds that fly backwards, or engineering climatic

<b>Floyd</b> | only my approval will improve his rank and get him out of here. He has
<b>Floyd</b> | some good points, such as tolerance for boredom, but this is not enough
<b>Floyd</b> | to prevent me wanting to strangle him.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | seven weeks ago: Liam told me about the flint knife in the Earth
<b>Floyd</b> | Sanctuary. Turns out it wasn't brought by us (always thought that a

<b>Floyd</b> | really odd thing to send) but they brought it here from Earth
<b>Floyd</b> | themselves. There's some sort of gloomy symbolism there which, as
<b>Floyd</b> | usual, he couldn't bring himself to explain directly. A less useful
<b>Floyd</b> | assistant would be difficult to find.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | five weeks ago: Is it possible that Liam is jealous of me because of

<b>Floyd</b> | Aylene? I find him lurking around after she's been here, looking sniffy
<b>Floyd</b> | and grim. Naturally Aylene's live rock doesn't offer any sort of data
<b>Floyd</b> | analysis function. That might be dangerously useful.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 22 days ago: Fight with Liam. Not my finest hour. Sometimes am almost
<b>Floyd</b> | glad they're getting me out of here. Filched the recording, that not

<b>Floyd</b> | being something I want anyone else to have a copy of. And I used to

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | four months ago: So. Put together the archive files on Charla and her

<b>Floyd</b> | including what looks like an opera. (Or some perversion thereof.) I'd

<b>Floyd</b> | *** Some weeks later ***
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I take it, then, that you support this decision?"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's not unpleasant to see Kruger grilling Valenti for a bit, rather
<b>Floyd</b> | than you. Though there's plenty of grilling to go around.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It was always a bad idea to invite them to Earth as our inferiors,"
<b>Floyd</b> | says Valenti stolidly. "I would have arranged things differently if I

<b>Floyd</b> | had been the ambassador at the time, but I do believe this is the best
<b>Floyd</b> | thing David could have done with the options available to him."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The idea that the Colonists work in collaboration with human
<b>Floyd</b> | scientists will not be received well at home," says Kruger.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "To understatement," Valenti replies, lifting his glass. He is drinking
<b>Floyd</b> | an anise liqueur he favors. You and Kruger watch him take another
<b>Floyd</b> | yellow sip. "Are you going to change the deal? I should warn you that
<b>Floyd</b> | alteration to a contract is viewed with extreme disfavor in their
<b>Floyd</b> | society."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Which is why you and David should have followed my advice in the first
<b>Floyd</b> | place!" Kruger yells. "I pulled Yamashita because she expressed
<b>Floyd</b> | reservations of conscience about what I was asking her to do, and I
<b>Floyd</b> | pulled you because I didn't trust you to follow orders, but I never
<b>Floyd</b> | thought David would go native on his first day there. What's wrong with
<b>Floyd</b> | you?"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Valenti frowns into his glass, swirling the ice around. "With respect,
<b>Floyd</b> | sir, you a few hours on Aleheart itself would have been enough to
<b>Floyd</b> | change your plans."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Kruger's face gradually loses the beet color. "We gave the matter a

<b>Floyd</b> | great deal of thought," he says. "Thought, study, polls, moral
<b>Floyd</b> | consultations. Also prayer, meditation, even a tarot reading or two,
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm told. Those were off the meeting record and on a strictly
<b>Floyd</b> | individual basis. But there is a female member of the commission who
<b>Floyd</b> | claims that a good tarot spread focuses her thinking."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "There are things you cannot reason out," Valenti says. "When you're
<b>Floyd</b> | face-to-face with the colonists, you see how much they long to be back
<b>Floyd</b> | on Earth. They are afraid of our bad opinion, conscious that they are
<b>Floyd</b> | our descendants, and embarrassed by how primitive we seem to be. But
<b>Floyd</b> | they are also infatuated. There are some dissenters, but most would do
<b>Floyd</b> | whatever they could to be with us again. They will bend themselves to

<b>Floyd</b> | fit Earth. We do not have to force them to do anything."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Kruger glares out the window. He does not say anything.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Valenti catches your eye and raises his glass in a small salute.

<b>Floyd</b> | same events, recorded in distinctly stylized and different forms --
<b>Floyd</b> | including what looks like an opera. (Or some perversion thereof.) I'd

<b>Floyd</b> | The weird thing is that they don't all end the same way -- apparently

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | four months ago: Oh my. Cross-comparing the data and the compression

<b>Floyd</b> | Aleheart family structure: On Aleheart Colony marriage bears a strong

<b>Floyd</b> | statements of the Aleheart diplomatic structure.  There are those

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Aleheart Colony: You've read the article before, but you refresh

<b>Floyd</b> | and powerful; how its forays into genetic experimentation came into
<b>Floyd</b> | conflict with many Earth laws; how Aleheart launched its own colony in
<b>Floyd</b> | order to have a place completely under its own jurisdiction.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | rumors of human experimentation that trickled back to Earth made it
<b>Floyd</b> | difficult for Aleheart to continue operating at home at all, so instead

<b>Floyd</b> | Sometime after Aleheart Colony was established, it lost all contact

<b>Floyd</b> | only two years ago, orbiting a star in the wrong place, and so much
<b>Floyd</b> | changed that at first contact Earth-command thought it had heard from

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | human genetic experimentation: There's no question, of course, that
<b>Floyd</b> | Aleheart has done things illegal on Earth -- far more extensively after
<b>Floyd</b> | all Earth contact was lost.  The current population is the product of
<b>Floyd</b> | those changes; they've been changed in appearance and body shape, and
<b>Floyd</b> | probably in an assortment of personality traits.  It is an open

<b>Floyd</b> | question whether they are still human enough for interbreeding, or
<b>Floyd</b> | whether they should now be considered a different species.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | office decor. Thought about donating hideous paintings to museum, but I
<b>Floyd</b> | worry this would lower us further in the opinion of the locals.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | six months ago: Well. Have been going through Yamashita's
<b>Floyd</b> | correspondence disk. I have solved the mystery of the hideous
<b>Floyd</b> | paintings: they appear to be a gift from a lover back home, who painted
<b>Floyd</b> | them herself. I had not guessed Yamashita was interesting enough to
<b>Floyd</b> | have a secret lover Kruger doesn't know about.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lover seems to be afflicted by residual plague nerve-degeneration too.
<b>Floyd</b> | I sense a conflict of interest! Wonder if Kruger did find out and yank
<b>Floyd</b> | Yamashita out for this reason? But since she doesn't seem to be
<b>Floyd</b> | languishing in disgrace, I don't know.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | four months ago: Destroyed Yamashita's correspondence disk. Don't
<b>Floyd</b> | really want HC reprimanding her after the fact for relationship that
<b>Floyd</b> | was probably the one thing keeping her sane... Then again, when I look
<b>Floyd</b> | at the paintings... Oh well.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | three months ago: Long talk with A, and she essentially confirmed for

<b>Floyd</b> | me what I had already pieced together, though with some bits that I
<b>Floyd</b> | hadn't quite understood about Peter and Charla. And then I got rid of
<b>Floyd</b> | the recordings. The destruction of data, a slippery slope. This was
<b>Floyd</b> | much bigger than getting rid of Yamashita's correspondence disc but it
<b>Floyd</b> | felt less awful, somehow. This is something I cannot, cannot report
<b>Floyd</b> | back if I want these people saved. And increasingly I do. Even my

<b>Floyd</b> | infuriating assistant.
