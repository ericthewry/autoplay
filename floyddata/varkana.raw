The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Varkana</i>, written by Maryam Gousheh-Forgeot.  <I>Varkana</I> was originally released as part of the 2007 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took sixth place. It went on to be nominated for a Best Individual PC Xyzzy Award, and won a Xyzzy for Best Setting.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Varkana'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Don't tarry, Nivanen, I cannot hold for long."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thus you urge your good friend to consider climbing down from your
<b>Floyd</b> | hands as soon as possible, as your fingers which you've hooked
<b>Floyd</b> | together to make her a foothold are beginning to ache. You're standing
<b>Floyd</b> | on a narrow ledge on top of a a brick wall, which is overshadowed by
<b>Floyd</b> | the higher stone wall of the Royal Nest. Your quickly-assembled plan
<b>Floyd</b> | to peek into the hangar has gone well so far. You found the proper
<b>Floyd</b> | spot just in time...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | [Picture number 3 here.]
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Not long ago, couriers brought news of a team of ambassadors being
<b>Floyd</b> | sent from the distant land of Ashtarta, in order to extend
<b>Floyd</b> | relationships with your fortified hometown of Arg Varkana. That
<b>Floyd</b> | sounded like good news; Ashtartans are advancing in many fields (and
<b>Floyd</b> | in territory, you pondered cautiously) and so maybe your secluded
<b>Floyd</b> | mountainous city-state, which is known only for its wine and
<b>Floyd</b> | pistachios, could benefit from good relations with them.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Everything would have been going normally if it wasn't for a
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation with Behzaad, your bookcrafting mentor. Last night at the
<b>Floyd</b> | dining hall he sat by you and gave you a task; your final task of
<b>Floyd</b> | apprenticeship, as he oddly called it: to repair an old book of poetry
<b>Floyd</b> | which is currently being held in the museum.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Before leaving the table, Behzaad gravely added that you'd better hide
<b>Floyd</b> | the book from the Ember order of Ashtartan scholars. They would want
<b>Floyd</b> | it at any price, especially in its current damaged state.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Enjoying your summer repose, you didn't give priority to his request,
<b>Floyd</b> | despite having heard ominous rumors of the diligent scholars and their
<b>Floyd</b> | disdain for law... until this evening, when to your amazement you
<b>Floyd</b> | heard news of Behzaad's departure from the town. However, before you
<b>Floyd</b> | could make up your mind what to do, the ambassadors' forthcoming
<b>Floyd</b> | arrival was announced. A party of your town's officials prepared to go
<b>Floyd</b> | and greet them in the Royal Nest where their vehicles had landed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You finally decided to get the book at once, but by then it was too
<b>Floyd</b> | late; the museum building was already closed. Your friend Nivanen
<b>Floyd</b> | suggested that you check to see whether or not there were any Ember
<b>Floyd</b> | scholars among the guests in the first place, as it is said that they
<b>Floyd</b> | are recognizable by the grey and red medallions they proudly wear
<b>Floyd</b> | around their necks. So the two of you set out to find a good vantage
<b>Floyd</b> | point from which to survey the guests before they go through the
<b>Floyd</b> | welcoming procedure and are guided to their lodging for the night...

<b>Floyd</b> | Varkana
<b>Floyd</b> | A discreet pursuit in Arg Varkana by Maryam Gousheh-Forgeot
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 1 / Serial number 070930 / Inform 7 build 4X60 (I6/v6.31 lib
<b>Floyd</b> | 6/11N)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Royal Nest's storeroom (on the ledge)
<b>Floyd</b> | The Royal Nest is the only public nest in Arg Varkana. It has
<b>Floyd</b> | facilities to house all kinds of common flying beasts as well as
<b>Floyd</b> | adequate tools to check and repair a range of mechanical vehicles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You're currently in a storeroom of the Nest, standing on top of a
<b>Floyd</b> | brick wall. You're holding Nivanen's unbooted foot in your cupped
<b>Floyd</b> | hands, providing her a leg up while she tries to peek over the stone
<b>Floyd</b> | wall beyond you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A ladder leads down to the solid ground.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see Nivanen here.

<b>Floyd</b> | to sound as unobtrusive as possible, "Well, um... if I can help you
<b>Floyd</b> | with finding something, just let me know. I work here. And I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | familiar with such topics," you point to the big book he's studying.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You're... familiar with the written myths. I'll try not to forget
<b>Floyd</b> | it." His eyes remain fixed on the book. You frown, and can't help
<b>Floyd</b> | retaliating, "To put it in such a crude manner, yes. This one we're
<b>Floyd</b> | looking at, for example, took two months of work. I redid the binding,
<b>Floyd</b> | repaired the pictures, and even some of the text. I'm indeed familiar
<b>Floyd</b> | with the written myths." You instantly regret your tactlessness. That
<b>Floyd</b> | wasn't quite you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He trails the contours of a picture with his fingertip, "So, you
<b>Floyd</b> | repair books?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Mainly, yes. I mean, I do illustrations in the bookcrafters'

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You must receive plenty of comissions."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | His brief compliment doesn't totally cheer you, but you recover your
<b>Floyd</b> | modesty, "Oh... not often these days. And it's just thanks to my
<b>Floyd</b> | mentor, Behzaad, that I managed to make it this far."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "He chooses the books for you?" You'd swear his gaze just intensified.
<b>Floyd</b> | You reply nevertheless, "Seldom, his apprentices share the work
<b>Floyd</b> | themselves becau-" "Has... Behzaad... chosen a book for you?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You feel a tingling in the back of your neck. "Yes, recently he told
<b>Floyd</b> | me to repair an old poem book from the museum's collection just before
<b>Floyd</b> | he left town, which I haven't done yet. Uh... what?" The tingling goes
<b>Floyd</b> | as quickly as it came. You wonder if it was your imagination.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A smile crosses his lips, "From what I hear, the last task he requests
<b>Floyd</b> | from his pupils is usually an extraordinary one. I wonder what's in
<b>Floyd</b> | that old poem book he asked you to repair. Something exciting, no
<b>Floyd</b> | doubt." He carefully closes the big book before him. "I must go and
<b>Floyd</b> | join the other ambassadors now. I wish I could stay here longer, or
<b>Floyd</b> | visit the old temple over there to do a drawing of Senmervae. But my
<b>Floyd</b> | time is short..." He gets up and starts tidying the books on a table.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Perhaps I can do it? The drawing, I mean," you ask hesitantly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ah, actually I'd really appreciate that. If you have time, of
<b>Floyd</b> | course."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I do, besides, it's a pleasant thing to draw. See you at lunch, I
<b>Floyd</b> | guess."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You watch as he mounts his vehicle and silently glides away. You rub

<b>Floyd</b> | Ardavaan seems to be confused. He gives you a poisonous look. "Do you

<b>Floyd</b> | which is enough for Ardavaan's hands to reach and grab your head from

<b>Floyd</b> | and you think you hear Ardavaan talking to Nivanen...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I will follow your lead, guard. Just as I said." Ardavaan lets go of
<b>Floyd</b> | Farahnaaz, who stands dazed before him. "What did you do to her?!" You
<b>Floyd</b> | try hard not to panic. Ardavaan motions you to unwield your axe, which
<b>Floyd</b> | you ignore. "Your friend is bound to me for as long as I need her." He
<b>Floyd</b> | smiles menacingly, "She deprived me of my vehicle, so it's only fair

<b>Floyd</b> | Bazaar
<b>Floyd</b> | The bazaar of Arg Varkana is under high brick domes interconnected

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The exits are to the east, north and west.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | You descend into a network of tunnels. Ardavaan draws a glow orb from
<b>Floyd</b> | his robes and you lead him in the approximate direction of the Royal
<b>Floyd</b> | Nest's vehicle hangar. Behind a locked door you hold the glow orb for
<b>Floyd</b> | Ardavaan so that he can handle his lockpick. From his trembling hands
<b>Floyd</b> | and sweated brow you can tell maintaining constant control on
<b>Floyd</b> | Farahnaaz is wearing him out... A few times she stumbles in her
<b>Floyd</b> | trance, but Ardavaan reaches for her on time.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For your part, your cat tends to go astray in the labyrinth and is
<b>Floyd</b> | deaf to your commands. Ardavaan catches Rasha before he finally pushes
<b>Floyd</b> | the last door open. You gasp in amazement; you're right behind the
<b>Floyd</b> | large Ashtartan vessel you saw last night and it looks even more
<b>Floyd</b> | gorgeous from up close.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Disgruntled, Rasha knocks the glow orb off Ardavaan's hand. It drops
<b>Floyd</b> | and shatters into tiny splinters.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hangar (Royal Nest)
<b>Floyd</b> | The hangar is a spacious chamber with a high ceiling. Unlike the noisy
<b>Floyd</b> | halls where flying beasts perch, this place is clean of hay and
<b>Floyd</b> | doesn't smell.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An access door for the passengers and the staff lies to the north. A
<b>Floyd</b> | pair of sliding gates lead to the landing platform to the west and are
<b>Floyd</b> | currently closed. The entrance to the tunnels is to the east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There's a large Ashtartan vessel in middle of chamber, with two
<b>Floyd</b> | identical one-man vehicles by its sides.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Ardavaan walks around the large vessel while inspecting it. He then
<b>Floyd</b> | goes to a one-man vehicle, but shakes his head, "It's too dark here
<b>Floyd</b> | without the glow orb." He calls on you to help him open the sliding
<b>Floyd</b> | gates so that more light can enter the hangar.

<b>Floyd</b> | The watchmen are momentarily surprised to find an ambassador and a
<b>Floyd</b> | town guard inside. They ask what you're doing here. Your gaze meets
<b>Floyd</b> | Ardavaan's and you take one step back in alarm, but too late. Frenzied
<b>Floyd</b> | for not having been given a weapon, he seizes your shoulder and
<b>Floyd</b> | forcefully hurls you to the nearest watchman. You go head first into
<b>Floyd</b> | his chest and you both fall. You see the legs of the second man go
<b>Floyd</b> | limp, and he drops to the ground near you, motionless. The third one
<b>Floyd</b> | gets savagely kicked in the ribs, but the last one leaps for Ardavaan
<b>Floyd</b> | and strives to prevent him from escaping into the vessel. The first
<b>Floyd</b> | watchman shoves you aside, gets up, and charges his crossbow. At the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You come over to Ardavaan but he's already dead; the pool of his blood
<b>Floyd</b> | on the floor constantly expanding. Hung from the chain around his neck
<b>Floyd</b> | you can now see the unmistakable Ember medallion sticking out of his
<b>Floyd</b> | collar, depicting a red goknous bird rising from gray ashes. His hand
<b>Floyd</b> | holds a pistol of some sort. A watchman gently pushes you aside and
<b>Floyd</b> | covers his dead body. You yell at him for not having captured him
<b>Floyd</b> | instead. He replies that he was too dangerous and uncontrollable. The
<b>Floyd</b> | sadness in his voice turns your attention to the body of his colleague
<b>Floyd</b> | who's been paralyzed to death... by Ardavaan's gun. You go to the
<b>Floyd</b> | vessel and see Farahnaaz is still asleep. However, upon closer

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | No way you're going to give your axe to Ardavaan again. You hand him
<b>Floyd</b> | your javelin instead. "Well I could do with a javelin."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You obey the watchmen and hold your hands up. Ardavaan casts you a
<b>Floyd</b> | side glance and slowly does the same, however, you're now wiser than
<b>Floyd</b> | to take it for surrender. A prickling flows up your arms and you
<b>Floyd</b> | realize you're unable to move them. You're then engulfed with a
<b>Floyd</b> | sensation not unlike falling from a great height, and in your panic
<b>Floyd</b> | you no longer hear the questions they are asking.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Ardavaan draws a deep breath. Then with a sudden jolt your arms and
<b>Floyd</b> | his are thrown forth. The men are all transfixed with an unseen power.
<b>Floyd</b> | With a powerful, commanding voice Ardavaan tells them to get out and
<b>Floyd</b> | immediately runs toward them. Dazed, they rush for the door without
<b>Floyd</b> | question. He then closes and bars the door by putting your javelin
<b>Floyd</b> | behind the slender columns which decorate the entrance; what, you
<b>Floyd</b> | regret, didn't cross your own mind before. As soon as he bars the
<b>Floyd</b> | door, you hear the men yelling and hitting the door in an attempt to
<b>Floyd</b> | break it open. Ardavaan runs back to the vessel and turns on the
<b>Floyd</b> | engine while you enter the seat next to the pilot. He then steers the
<b>Floyd</b> | vessel out of the hangar.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Above the clouds (in vessel)
<b>Floyd</b> | In vessel you can see Ardavaan, Farahnaaz and Rasha.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You sink into your seat, occasionally moving your arms and hands to
<b>Floyd</b> | make sure they're in your command. Ardavaan gives you a playful smile,
<b>Floyd</b> | "I briefly channeled your force without your permission." "Yes, you
<b>Floyd</b> | leeched something out of me. Are you happy with it?" "I'm just glad
<b>Floyd</b> | you didn't resist. But if I'm not mistaken, in Arg Varkana people
<b>Floyd</b> | don't know how to do it." "Do what?" His smile fades, "You don't block
<b>Floyd</b> | your minds to intrusions." "Well, we guardians learn some stuff about
<b>Floyd</b> | it and get some training, but since we have no use for it most tend to
<b>Floyd</b> | forget." "You've been fortunate, but it won't last long." "If there
<b>Floyd</b> | are more of your kind in Ashtarta... I hope our Argbaan knows about
<b>Floyd</b> | it." He nods. "Lady Atossa knows. And she did so even before I warned
<b>Floyd</b> | her."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your eyes widen in surprise. But he firmly changes the topic, "Now,
<b>Floyd</b> | let's see where we can stop to rest. There should be a map behind my
<b>Floyd</b> | seat. Please take it, I need you to find us a destination."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Whatever his motives, Ardavaan managed to steal the poem book and has
<b>Floyd</b> | now escaped with his life. You trust his word on restoring Farahnaaz
<b>Floyd</b> | and sending you back home, and both of you keep to this temporary
<b>Floyd</b> | truce, but somewhere in the back of your mind you wish you could have
<b>Floyd</b> | discovered more about him and his mission. Perhaps you could have
<b>Floyd</b> | tried harder to gain his trust... You shrug; he may have escaped from
<b>Floyd</b> | Varkana, but he's still in your grasp - from your new point of view.
<b>Floyd</b> | Future adventures seem unavoidable. You try to brace yourself for
<b>Floyd</b> | whatever lies ahead.

<b>Floyd</b> | Ardavaan raises the hood of the large vessel and releases Rasha who
<b>Floyd</b> | jumps inside. Then he lifts Farahnaaz and places her in the back seat.
<b>Floyd</b> | Farahnaaz's eyes close and her head drops to her chest.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The men try to push the door open but find it's jammed. They start
<b>Floyd</b> | hitting it ferociously. Ardavaan calls you to quickly enter the vessel
<b>Floyd</b> | as he gets into the pilot's seat and turns on the engine.

</TD><td></td><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | You get into the vessel and take the seat next to Ardavaan.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Hangar (Royal Nest) (in vessel)
<b>Floyd</b> | The hangar is a spacious chamber with a high ceiling. Unlike the noisy
<b>Floyd</b> | halls where flying beasts perch, this place is clean of hay and
<b>Floyd</b> | doesn't smell.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An access door for the passengers and the staff lies to the north. A
<b>Floyd</b> | pair of sliding gates lead to the landing platform to the west. The
<b>Floyd</b> | entrance to the tunnels is to the east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In vessel you can see Ardavaan, Farahnaaz and Rasha.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your javelin that was barring the door finally breaks and the door
<b>Floyd</b> | opens. Four armed watchmen rush in and tell you to freeze. They're
<b>Floyd</b> | momentarily surprised to see an ambassador and a town guard inside,
<b>Floyd</b> | but that doesn't last for long as they see you trying for escape. A
<b>Floyd</b> | metal bolt charged with blinding smoke crashes into the vessel's hood,
<b>Floyd</b> | but you dodge and quickly discard it through the same hole it bore in
<b>Floyd</b> | the hood. Ardavaan steers the vessel out of hangar. Two watchmen get
<b>Floyd</b> | into the small vehicles only to find them disabled.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You hear Ardavaan laughing as he pulls a lever. The sudden
<b>Floyd</b> | acceleration presses your body into the back of your seat.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Above the clouds (in vessel)
<b>Floyd</b> | In vessel you can see Ardavaan, Farahnaaz and Rasha.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "They surely aim well. If it wasn't for your thoughtfulness to bar the
<b>Floyd</b> | door, they would have gotten us." "It was the best solution I could
<b>Floyd</b> | think of... Now, would you tell me why you came all the way to steal
<b>Floyd</b> | this book? Because, well, it doesn't make any sense to me..." He
<b>Floyd</b> | studies your face before he replies, "It's a long story, but with the
<b>Floyd</b> | time you bought me in the hangar and trusting me - not to mention
<b>Floyd</b> | showing me the way - I guess I'll tell you."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He sits back and stares ahead. "You see, after the overthrow of the
<b>Floyd</b> | Ashtartan monarchy..." "So it's true that there was a monarchy?" "...
<b>Floyd</b> | Of course. Well, after the change in the regime, those with official
<b>Floyd</b> | posts in the former regime were persecuted. I was in the Royal
<b>Floyd</b> | Ashtartan Engineers' Guild; a guild too important to be disrupted
<b>Floyd</b> | since many professions depend on it, so they spared us.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Meanwhile, due to my interests, I ended up joining the Ashtartan
<b>Floyd</b> | branch of the Ember Order; the famous order of scholars dedicated to
<b>Floyd</b> | historical research, archaeological expeditions and ancient lore." You
<b>Floyd</b> | nod your acknowledgement. The Order is well-known, even in Varkana. He
<b>Floyd</b> | goes on, "The council is working on a new presentation of history to
<b>Floyd</b> | gain a foothold and legitimate its position. I knew they wouldn't
<b>Floyd</b> | tolerate one of their own officials - especially one who had served
<b>Floyd</b> | the monarchy - joining the troublesome Order who doesn't share their
<b>Floyd</b> | interests. So I kept it secret, and pretended I was just trying to
<b>Floyd</b> | convince those scholars to support the council.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Order occasionally benefits from the services of astral
<b>Floyd</b> | travellers. Not long ago, I was sent to one of their hideouts deep in
<b>Floyd</b> | a jungle to ask for their service. Their priestess kindly accepted my
<b>Floyd</b> | request and prepared for the ritual. However, little did I know that I
<b>Floyd</b> | had been secretly followed by one of my own colleagues from the
<b>Floyd</b> | guild." He absently rubs the scar on his chin. "... After she lay on
<b>Floyd</b> | the dais and projected her soul from her body, my colleague released a
<b>Floyd</b> | charge of disruptive energy and nearly destroyed her link. He was
<b>Floyd</b> | captured, but too late; the damage was already done.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I couldn't let my negligence cost the priestess her life, so I
<b>Floyd</b> | consulted her people, and together we managed to locate a list of
<b>Floyd</b> | potential cures. Volunteers went after each one. I selected three
<b>Floyd</b> | items, and now I've got two of them, one of them being this book of
<b>Floyd</b> | poetry.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I knew some ambassadors would be departing for Arg Varkana, so I asked
<b>Floyd</b> | to join them while announcing that I intended to seek this book for
<b>Floyd</b> | the Ember scholars in an exchange for informative historical data that
<b>Floyd</b> | could further the council's agenda. I was granted permission, but a
<b>Floyd</b> | few days before our departure, my colleague who had escaped from his
<b>Floyd</b> | captivity arrived at Ashtarta to give me away and probably later claim
<b>Floyd</b> | my post. Fortunately I escaped before I was arrested.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | However, I still took the risk of using my Ashtartan uniform as a
<b>Floyd</b> | disguise to come and navigate Arg Varkana, and interrogate its people
<b>Floyd</b> | for the book. I knew your Argbaan well enough to know she'd understand
<b>Floyd</b> | and trust me as before... Unlike Behzaad, my old mentor who also
<b>Floyd</b> | educated Farahnaaz: the fact that I wasn't persecuted after the change
<b>Floyd</b> | in regime troubled him, so he didn't contact me again. It seems he's
<b>Floyd</b> | had his resources, and somehow reached the conclusion that Ashtartans
<b>Floyd</b> | sought this book for some vile reason, so he told Farahnaaz to
<b>Floyd</b> | "repair" the book - which would neutralize its property - before he
<b>Floyd</b> | left."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Ardavaan draws the poem book and opens it before you. "It may look
<b>Floyd</b> | like an ordinary old book, but it contains the chants that strengthen
<b>Floyd</b> | the lost astral traveller to bring her back, if directly read from
<b>Floyd</b> | these pages. The other thing I've collected is a seed of the rare
<b>Floyd</b> | soulbeam flower. If planted nearby, it acts as a beacon for the soul
<b>Floyd</b> | to return to the living body." He reaches in his pocket and brings out
<b>Floyd</b> | the seed. You marvel at its beauty; it resembles a burnished gemstone.
<b>Floyd</b> | You finally tell him you understand how important his mission is, and
<b>Floyd</b> | he doesn't need to worry about you giving him away. His acknowledging
<b>Floyd</b> | smile is warm and genuine. "We'll have to stop somewhere so that I can
<b>Floyd</b> | rest. I'll then be able to restore Farahnaaz and send you back home.
<b>Floyd</b> | There's a map behind my seat; please take it, and find us a
<b>Floyd</b> | destination."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You open the map on your knees to study it. You feel a lot better now
<b>Floyd</b> | that you've heard his story, and you're grateful that he shared it
<b>Floyd</b> | with you. Ardavaan pauses, as if remembering something, "I hope I
<b>Floyd</b> | haven't caused too much trouble for Lady Atossa... Make sure she's not
<b>Floyd</b> | too angry with me before you give her my greetings."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |     *** Congratulations! ***

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In that game you scored 83 out of a possible 90, in 752 turns.

<b>Floyd</b> | Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?
