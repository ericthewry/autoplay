<b>Floyd</b> | Well, this has not been a great day for you. Your shoelace broke, you

<b>Floyd</b> | work, but still, you're not really a big fan of things being set on
<b>Floyd</b> | fire. (Unless you're doing it, which is only when there's a good
<b>Floyd</b> | cause.) So this is a problem. The flames have engulfed most of the
<b>Floyd</b> | room now. You can feel your hair frizzling in the heat. As the fire

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You look down at your charcoal-grey suit. It's a very nice suit. You
<b>Floyd</b> | just picked it up from the dry-cleaners last night. If you had known
<b>Floyd</b> | that both it and you were going to be reduced to a pile of ash not
<b>Floyd</b> | twenty-four hours later, you wouldn't have bothered. What would be
<b>Floyd</b> | great is if you had some kind of advance warning of these things,
<b>Floyd</b> | though you guess if you had then you could've been well out of town by
<b>Floyd</b> | now. Obviously saving yourself would be better than just saving your
<b>Floyd</b> | suit. What would be even better than that, of course, would be saving
<b>Floyd</b> | the data that you've collected over the past few months--although if
<b>Floyd</b> | you could save both the data and yourself, that'd be best of all.
<b>Floyd</b> | Where did you leave that stuff, anyway? You're sure you left yourself
<b>Floyd</b> | a note about it somewhere around here...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | While you've been dithering, the fire has been spreading, and by the
<b>Floyd</b> | time you actually start thinking about how to get out, it's too late.

<b>Floyd</b> | though. In it she has her face half turned away from the camera, her
<b>Floyd</b> | long black hair and incredibly large hat obscuring most of her
<b>Floyd</b> | features. You always thought her distaste for being caught on film was
<b>Floyd</b> | shyness. You weren't sure what to make of the hats, though, even then.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you pick up the photograph, you notice a memo to yourself scribbled
<b>Floyd</b> | on the back, reminding you to do the things you gotta do and touch
<b>Floyd</b> | the... floor? Huh. You make a mental note to leave yourself clearer
<b>Floyd</b> | notes in the future, then tuck the photograph into your pocket and
<b>Floyd</b> | make a break for it through the window. As you flee the scene, it
<b>Floyd</b> | occurs to you that there was something more important you could've

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The reactor core blazes chaotically hundreds of meters below your
<b>Floyd</b> | feet. Hundreds of thousands of kilometers beyond the core roils the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And so it is. The unstable core blasts into space, disappearing so

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Against the black orifice shines a beautiful light--the core has
<b>Floyd</b> | finally exploded. Seconds later the shock wave reaches you. The
<b>Floyd</b> | station quakes, the remaining energy relays burst into fragments, and
<b>Floyd</b> | the fractures within the plasticine bubble widen. You fall, knocking
<b>Floyd</b> | your head against the keypad.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's Ululul who shakes you awake, holding the mangled translator bot
<b>Floyd</b> | in his fingers. "The shock wave," the translator croaks for the
<b>Floyd</b> | injured alien. "It must have propelled the station to a higher orbit.
<b>Floyd</b> | We have stabilized, and help is on the way." He holds out his hand and
<b>Floyd</b> | as you reach out to take his, your fingertips brush, releasing a
<b>Floyd</b> | static discharge that makes both of you jump back. For a second
<b>Floyd</b> | there's silence, then the cosmos echoes with the first joint laughter
<b>Floyd</b> | of human and Hexergon.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An ant wanders round the duct tape on my wrists and finally, I lose
<b>Floyd</b> | it. It's all been such a slog. 'This'll be a nice relaxing afternoon,'
<b>Floyd</b> | I'd assumed. That is, until Lewis showed up to "borrow the car to go
<b>Floyd</b> | to the big box". Which would have been fine if I hadn't been in it at
<b>Floyd</b> | the time. I mean, I know he was pissed about the money, but really? At
<b>Floyd</b> | gunpoint? On a Sunday?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Back at home an hour later, I was about to watch the game. In stormed
<b>Floyd</b> | Lewis with a bundle of sheet plastic, the duct tape, and this look on
<b>Floyd</b> | his face, and I just knew I'd miss the score. But I definitely hadn't
<b>Floyd</b> | counted on a long, boring drive. And when we got to the cliff-top?
<b>Floyd</b> | Wanker made me get out and help push, and then shoved me carelessly
<b>Floyd</b> | back in the car, possibly spraining my arm. And now I'm just falling
<b>Floyd</b> | to my death and there is an ant in here. Maybe even ants, plural!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now, I'm no control freak about my possessions. I ask only that they
<b>Floyd</b> | be returned in the exact same condition as when they were borrowed. I
<b>Floyd</b> | ask only that one damn thing! So... "That's it!" I exclaim, and I peel
<b>Floyd</b> | off the tape. Open the glove box, and out tumbles (weightless in
<b>Floyd</b> | freefall) my phone, followed by a pistol I keep for extreme
<b>Floyd</b> | emergencies. Taking up the pistol, I scream: <span class="floydstyle em">"No more Mister Nice</span>

<b>Floyd</b> | Three bullets. Three zombies. One inside (not counting the severed

<b>Floyd</b> | There is no more room for error, especially since the one inside just

<b>Floyd</b> | and I'm 'infected'. Best case scenario? I survive the fall by landing
<b>Floyd</b> | perfectly on a pile of ghoulish corpses, only to transform ghoulishly
<b>Floyd</b> | into another ghoulish corpse. I don't want to be a crash test zombie.
<b>Floyd</b> | So I take the one-bullet exit. Just before impact, I shoot myself.
<b>Floyd</b> | Right in the head.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sadly, since neither neurological activity nor muscle movements can be

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">As I got hit by a car there was a message for me. As I went</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">through the windshield I noticed something</span>. My phone. The driver
<b>Floyd</b> | had an enraged look about him, which is lame. If he'd been checking
<b>Floyd</b> | his blind spots instead of talking on *his* phone, he wouldn't have a
<b>Floyd</b> | pile of sentient metal in his passenger seat right now. I say 'pile'
<b>Floyd</b> | but I am more of a deceptively disorganised assemblage. It's a long
<b>Floyd</b> | story about a mound of scrapped computer parts repeatedly struck by
<b>Floyd</b> | lightning in a dump down the street from the leaky nuclear plant that
<b>Floyd</b> | once powered a nearby decommissioned supercollider. Anyway, the only
<b>Floyd</b> | reason I can relate all of this is that I am self-aware.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So I'd just got done chewing on some cable, when this dude careens
<b>Floyd</b> | onto the bridge going maybe 40 over the limit and drifting to the
<b>Floyd</b> | right. I figured this was the best chance I'd ever get, so I let go of
<b>Floyd</b> | my perch. I'm less than half the weight of this car, but my impact on
<b>Floyd</b> | the frame nearly crushed it. Luckily there was enough momentum left to
<b>Floyd</b> | carry us both over the side, and bingo! We are falling. My exit's
<b>Floyd</b> | coming up any second, but I should have time for one voicemail. The
<b>Floyd</b> | dude, however, is still screaming.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Shut up man," I croak. "I'm trying to hear this." And then he tells
<b>Floyd</b> | me to get out of *his* car. "It's my car now, pal! Look around." One
<b>Floyd</b> | look out his windshield and he's forgotten me in favour of the water
<b>Floyd</b> | rushing up to greet us. Which reminds me that I missed my jumpoff! I
<b>Floyd</b> | spring up, way up, and out, but it's just too late, and I am dunked in
<b>Floyd</b> | the river less than *10 metres* from the island dump's shoreline. My
<b>Floyd</b> | circuits are shorting. I imagine the taste-that-would-have-been:

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I am wearing a watch. It's made of stars. It has <span class="floydstyle em">a minute hand, a</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">millenium hand, and an eon hand</span>, but all of the hands are made of
<b>Floyd</b> | planets. The whole assemblage is strapped, like any watch, to my
<b>Floyd</b> | wrist, which extends nebulously from the galaxies of my elbow like...
<b>Floyd</b> | a wrist. I heave a sigh, and a thousand spiral arms collide. The watch
<b>Floyd</b> | still reads the same as when I last checked, and I feel vaguely
<b>Floyd</b> | ashamed. There is no point to this behaviour when you're sitting in
<b>Floyd</b> | traffic that's fallen for billions of years and will fall for billions
<b>Floyd</b> | more.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Don't spread it around, but I think I lost interest in the Great
<b>Floyd</b> | Attractor. Ever since the universe was young, when I first climbed
<b>Floyd</b> | into my pimped supercluster and peeled off on this whole space trip,
<b>Floyd</b> | the Attractor's been my compass. We were so in love. Everything was a
<b>Floyd</b> | big bang, then.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | However, time spins on, and I am no longer in the best of health. I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | afraid I might have cancer of the black hole. Besides, no matter how
<b>Floyd</b> | quickly I descend, the Attractor just plays hard to get. Dark energy:
<b>Floyd</b> | when did *that* become a factor? It's all starting to sound
<b>Floyd</b> | suspiciously like heat death, and I am just. So. Tired. Do you find it
<b>Floyd</b> | gaseous in here? I should crack a window. What do you think would
<b>Floyd</b> | happen if I stepped outside?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Don't worry. I'm kidding. Ha ha. I am too old. It'd take a billion
<b>Floyd</b> | years I haven't got.

<b>Floyd</b> | Right. So I kick out the door, which swings open into an immediate

<b>Floyd</b> | chances are grim but I have no choice. I dive through the curtain of

<b>Floyd</b> | blood as the car explodes at the bottom of the ravine.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A sombrero, probably caught by wind, spins to a stop at my broken

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The sombrero looks just as it did when first spotted on Mars, scooping
<b>Floyd</b> | samples into its wide brim with the mech extenders it stows (when not
<b>Floyd</b> | in use) under a central dome. Alarmists labelled it a monster. Of
<b>Floyd</b> | course, the probability had always been that Earth's first contact
<b>Floyd</b> | would be not with a sentient alien, but with an automated probe.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And here it is, <span class="floydstyle em">gently waving in the air above the meadow</span>,
<b>Floyd</b> | heaped full of soil freshly sampled from my neighbourhood. Just now,
<b>Floyd</b> | its great scoopers retracted to be replaced by the long, thin pickers
<b>Floyd</b> | that sift organic matter from concrete and houses and wire. I seized
<b>Floyd</b> | upon this as my chance to bolt, from the bedroom (which had been
<b>Floyd</b> | relocated to the garage) into my car. The driveway had become just a
<b>Floyd</b> | cracked assemblage of tar floes, but there was still enough traction
<b>Floyd</b> | for me to burn rubber and rocket over that sombrero's rim.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And so here I am, gently falling in the air above the meadow, having
<b>Floyd</b> | used my final moment to review the few before. And as I glimpse my
<b>Floyd</b> | final glimpse -- tall grasses blowing in a summer breeze -- I wish

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Stop!" I scream. "You're killing me!" And it seems to work. At least,
<b>Floyd</b> | the swinging stops. The car is raised to the giant robot's giant-eye
<b>Floyd</b> | level. I display my bloodied head and injuries, trying to appear as
<b>Floyd</b> | frail as humanly possible. Finally, the giant mouth opens wide,
<b>Floyd</b> | looking almost sad, and with a voice like chains pulled through a
<b>Floyd</b> | pipe, intones: <span class="floydstyle em">"ROBOTS OBEY WHAT THE CHILDREN SAY."</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And then the robot giggles. Or no, there *was* a giggle, but it was a
<b>Floyd</b> | child's. It must have come from the giant playroom's giant intercom.
<b>Floyd</b> | There is another sound from that intercom -- something faint.
<b>Floyd</b> | Something odd. But my car radio is still on: I'd have to turn it off,
<b>Floyd</b> | or listen harder. But I am out of time for curiosities. "Throw it
<b>Floyd</b> | again!" comes the child's voice. And the robot does just that.

<b>Floyd</b> | An ant wanders round the duct tape on my wrists and finally, I lose

<b>Floyd</b> | the time. I mean, I know he was pissed about the money, but really? At

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Back at home an hour later, I was about to watch the game. In stormed
<b>Floyd</b> | Lewis with a bundle of sheet plastic, the duct tape, and this look on
<b>Floyd</b> | his face, and I just knew I'd miss the score. But I definitely hadn't
<b>Floyd</b> | counted on a long, boring drive. And when we got to the cliff-top?
<b>Floyd</b> | Wanker made me get out and help push, and then shoved me carelessly
<b>Floyd</b> | back in the car, possibly spraining my arm. And now I'm just falling
<b>Floyd</b> | to my death and there is an ant in here. Maybe even ants, plural!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now, I'm no control freak about my possessions. I ask only that they
<b>Floyd</b> | be returned in the exact same condition as when they were borrowed. I

<b>Floyd</b> | people out, and doing something to them -- I don't know what exactly,
<b>Floyd</b> | but something bad, because once they'd had it done, they didn't get

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Wrong move, as it happens. When they can't get you out of a car, it's

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's not the longest fall, but long enough. Unsure what else to do, I

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">guitar for the Mesopotamians</span>. But I *did* crash my car, only
<b>Floyd</b> | instead of being dead, I'm writing a song about it. "Yeah? Can I hear
<b>Floyd</b> | it?" Sure, no problem. "By the way, that is a kickass guitar." It's
<b>Floyd</b> | more than just kickass. This guitar may have saved my life in the very
<b>Floyd</b> | crash of which I am about to sing. "Really? In what variety of ways

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | And then *they* came, great crowds of them: mobbing the cars, pulling
<b>Floyd</b> | people out, and doing something to them -- I don't know what exactly,
<b>Floyd</b> | but something bad, because once they'd had it done, they didn't get

<b>Floyd</b> | It's not the longest fall, but long enough. Unsure what else to do, I

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An ant wanders round the duct tape on my wrists and finally, I lose
<b>Floyd</b> | it. It's all been such a slog. 'This'll be a nice relaxing afternoon,'
<b>Floyd</b> | I'd assumed. That is, until Lewis showed up to "borrow the car to go

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Back at home an hour later, I was about to watch the game. In stormed

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle input">&gt; PUSH BUTTON</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | No question about it: the void is much improved over its former self.
<b>Floyd</b> | Oh, I dabbled in reality, but as it turns out, the universe sucks, so
<b>Floyd</b> | I vowed to destroy it. But you can't, from inside. There is a very old
<b>Floyd</b> | legend on my world, about an exit ramp from the actual universe. I
<b>Floyd</b> | know -- it sounds superstitious, even to me (and I've been honouring
<b>Floyd</b> | the road gods for a thousand years). They say you have to ride the
<b>Floyd</b> | most snarled cloverleafs in the galaxy to get there. We're talking
<b>Floyd</b> | round-the-clock rush hour through centuries worth of interlooping
<b>Floyd</b> | overpasses and curves.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Most just laugh this story off, but they don't have my passion. I
<b>Floyd</b> | actually looked for it. I actually found it. It wasn't easy: I had to
<b>Floyd</b> | buy the deed to the property from a realtor on his deathbed. <span class="floydstyle em">"Have</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">no fear,"</span> he said. <span class="floydstyle em">"You will be killed right away."</span> I
<b>Floyd</b> | thought that was honest at least, so I paid the man and proceeded to
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">kiss the girl from Venus, for science</span> (or more specifically,
<b>Floyd</b> | for the superweapon intel she had stored on her glandtop).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As advertised, the exit ramp led exactly nowhere. On my way out I
<b>Floyd</b> | pulled a 180, just like we used to do in the parking stadium back
<b>Floyd</b> | home. Only this time I <span class="floydstyle em">got those missiles ready to destroy the</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">universe</span>. My rate of spin brought my targeting scope to bear for
<b>Floyd</b> | just a moment. It was enough. I pushed the button and let fly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now it's just me and the void. And the falling. I don't know why I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | still alive, but that realtor was dead wrong, and now he's just dead.
<b>Floyd</b> | But at least I've got my car. Hmm. Odometer's blinking something
<b>Floyd</b> | unreadable. Must have got cracked in the missile launch. So I just

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I am wearing a watch. It's made of stars. It has <span class="floydstyle em">a minute hand, a</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">millenium hand, and an eon hand</span>, but all of the hands are made of
<b>Floyd</b> | planets. The whole assemblage is strapped, like any watch, to my
<b>Floyd</b> | wrist, which extends nebulously from the galaxies of my elbow like...
<b>Floyd</b> | a wrist. I heave a sigh, and a thousand spiral arms collide. The watch
<b>Floyd</b> | still reads the same as when I last checked, and I feel vaguely
<b>Floyd</b> | ashamed. There is no point to this behaviour when you're sitting in
<b>Floyd</b> | traffic that's fallen for billions of years and will fall for billions
<b>Floyd</b> | more.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Don't spread it around, but I think I lost interest in the Great
<b>Floyd</b> | Attractor. Ever since the universe was young, when I first climbed
<b>Floyd</b> | into my pimped supercluster and peeled off on this whole space trip,
<b>Floyd</b> | the Attractor's been my compass. We were so in love. Everything was a
<b>Floyd</b> | big bang, then.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | However, time spins on, and I am no longer in the best of health. I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | afraid I might have cancer of the black hole. Besides, no matter how
<b>Floyd</b> | quickly I descend, the Attractor just plays hard to get. Dark energy:
<b>Floyd</b> | when did *that* become a factor? It's all starting to sound
<b>Floyd</b> | suspiciously like heat death, and I am just. So. Tired. Do you find it
<b>Floyd</b> | gaseous in here? I should crack a window. What do you think would
<b>Floyd</b> | happen if I stepped outside?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Don't worry. I'm kidding. Ha ha. I am too old. It'd take a billion
<b>Floyd</b> | years I haven't got.

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">I make out a spiralling shape</span>. It's <span class="floydstyle em">hypnotic and strange</span>

<b>Floyd</b> | I look over at the side windows just in time to see the doors buckle

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Stop!" I scream. "You're killing me!" And it seems to work. At least,
<b>Floyd</b> | the swinging stops. The car is raised to the giant robot's giant-eye
<b>Floyd</b> | level. I display my bloodied head and injuries, trying to appear as

<b>Floyd</b> | looking almost sad, and with a voice like chains pulled through a
<b>Floyd</b> | pipe, intones: <span class="floydstyle em">"ROBOTS OBEY WHAT THE CHILDREN SAY."</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And then the robot giggles. Or no, there *was* a giggle, but it was a

<b>Floyd</b> | There is another sound from that intercom -- something faint.
<b>Floyd</b> | Something odd. But my car radio is still on: I'd have to turn it off,

<b>Floyd</b> | light, and there's an audio alert, but I'd rather hear the song -- I
<b>Floyd</b> | love this song. Earth radio is the best. Not that there is any other
<b>Floyd</b> | radio; at least, not since I destroyed all other life on the moon for
<b>Floyd</b> | being so annoying. It's a long story, but seriously they deserved it.
<b>Floyd</b> | The next time the Earthlings came <span class="floydstyle em">by rocket to the moon... I was</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">the only living creature there</span>.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I made sure they didn't spot me. I was a longtime listener of course,
<b>Floyd</b> | and had definite plans to visit, but only a monkey'd bet his ass on a
<b>Floyd</b> | can covered in tin foil. I wanted to arrive in style, so I started on

<b>Floyd</b> | resemblance to a '57 Chevy with warp drive, it's intentional. (Had a
<b>Floyd</b> | little trouble with the theory part, so the nacelles are decorative --
<b>Floyd</b> | for now.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Anyway the point is: Earth, here I come! Watched from orbit for a
<b>Floyd</b> | while, but that's just dull. Would *Jim Kirk* watch from orbit? No, so
<b>Floyd</b> | let's get dirty: I have started my descent. My retro rockets just

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | No question about it: the void is much improved over its former self.
<b>Floyd</b> | Oh, I dabbled in reality, but as it turns out, the universe sucks, so
<b>Floyd</b> | I vowed to destroy it. But you can't, from inside. There is a very old
<b>Floyd</b> | legend on my world, about an exit ramp from the actual universe. I
<b>Floyd</b> | know -- it sounds superstitious, even to me (and I've been honouring
<b>Floyd</b> | the road gods for a thousand years). They say you have to ride the
<b>Floyd</b> | most snarled cloverleafs in the galaxy to get there. We're talking
<b>Floyd</b> | round-the-clock rush hour through centuries worth of interlooping
<b>Floyd</b> | overpasses and curves.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Most just laugh this story off, but they don't have my passion. I
<b>Floyd</b> | actually looked for it. I actually found it. It wasn't easy: I had to
<b>Floyd</b> | buy the deed to the property from a realtor on his deathbed. <span class="floydstyle em">"Have</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">no fear,"</span> he said. <span class="floydstyle em">"You will be killed right away."</span> I
<b>Floyd</b> | thought that was honest at least, so I paid the man and proceeded to
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">kiss the girl from Venus, for science</span> (or more specifically,
<b>Floyd</b> | for the superweapon intel she had stored on her glandtop).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As advertised, the exit ramp led exactly nowhere. On my way out I
<b>Floyd</b> | pulled a 180, just like we used to do in the parking stadium back
<b>Floyd</b> | home. Only this time I <span class="floydstyle em">got those missiles ready to destroy the</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">universe</span>. My rate of spin brought my targeting scope to bear for
<b>Floyd</b> | just a moment. It was enough. I pushed the button and let fly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now it's just me and the void. And the falling. I don't know why I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | still alive, but that realtor was dead wrong, and now he's just dead.
<b>Floyd</b> | But at least I've got my car. Hmm. Odometer's blinking something
<b>Floyd</b> | unreadable. Must have got cracked in the missile launch. So I just
<b>Floyd</b> | stare at my watch for a while.

<b>Floyd</b> |
