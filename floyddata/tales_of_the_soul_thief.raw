						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Tales of the Soul Thief</em> written by David Whyld.
						It was an entry in the 2014 IntroComp.

<b>Floyd</b> | Foreshadowing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You've travelled a long way to reach this place. A cursed city, some
<b>Floyd</b> | call it, others a city of the unliving. A city where the Fallen One
<b>Floyd</b> | holds sway and certainly not a place visited lightly by those without
<b>Floyd</b> | great need to come here. But you have a need, and a great one at that.
<b>Floyd</b> | Somewhere in Foreshadowing lives (or, more accurately, hides) a man
<b>Floyd</b> | known as Taktaal, once a torturer from Galamenkaris, City of the
<b>Floyd</b> | Imperium, now a fugitive with a price on his head and the Steel Eyes
<b>Floyd</b> | of the Imperium on his trail. A hunted man.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Just as you, in your own way, are hunted, though for entirely
<b>Floyd</b> | different reasons.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So you have come to Foreshadowing to find the one man in the world who
<b>Floyd</b> | might be able to save you.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Before you rise the rusted gates of Foreshadowing, its towers and
<b>Floyd</b> | fortresses hidden by thick walls. A long line of people, most dressed
<b>Floyd</b> | in little more than rags and bearing signs of the Wasting Sickness,
<b>Floyd</b> | are here to seek access to the city; an access given grudgingly it
<b>Floyd</b> | seems, for the hulking guards at the gate appear to turn away far more
<b>Floyd</b> | people than they admit. At this rate, it will take many hours to gain
<b>Floyd</b> | admittance - if, indeed, you are allowed inside at all, which is
<b>Floyd</b> | hardly a guarantee.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But this is the only way into the city. The other gates are kept
<b>Floyd</b> | permanently locked and warded with the kind of spells you don't have a
<b>Floyd</b> | hope of bypassing - only here, at the southern most gate, might you
<b>Floyd</b> | find a way inside Foreshadowing.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You're younger than you look, but feel much older than you really are.
<b>Floyd</b> | Being on the run, hunted by the inhuman Steel Eyes, ages you more and
<b>Floyd</b> | more each day, and the strain of Soul Theft doesn't help. So far
<b>Floyd</b> | you've managed to stay ahead of your pursuers, but you're sure it'll
<b>Floyd</b> | only be a matter of time before they catch you. You, after all, have
<b>Floyd</b> | to sleep; they don't.

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle input">&gt; X AMULET</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It looks like an ordinary amulet, which is a relief because it's
<b>Floyd</b> | anything but. This was given to you as a gift by your mother on the
<b>Floyd</b> | day you achieved your first SoulSteal, and now it's bonded to you by a
<b>Floyd</b> | magic you don't fully understand, but which you're eternally grateful
<b>Floyd</b> | for. This is all that keeps the Steel Eyes from finding you each time
<b>Floyd</b> | you steal a soul, and all that stops their magic from tracking your
<b>Floyd</b> | every movement. Drop it and it will return to you whether you want it
<b>Floyd</b> | to or not. Damaging it is possible, although not easy, and you believe
<b>Floyd</b> | that if it is ever destroyed you will die with it.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | SoulSteal: this is the ability by which a Soul Thief can steal the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Assuming you're willing to take the risk, you can attempt to steal the
<b>Floyd</b> | soul of another human being (SoulSteal does not work on animals or

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You focus your mind on the nearest of the guards, the biggest one, a

<b>Floyd</b> | hope), and then <span class="floydstyle em">strike!</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There is no physical effect of using SoulSteal, but it can greatly
<b>Floyd</b> | weaken the target, and the guard is no exception. He staggers to one
<b>Floyd</b> | side, clutching his head, then seizes onto the wall to steady himself.
<b>Floyd</b> | The other guard looks at him with concern - not, you imagine, due to
<b>Floyd</b> | the guard being ill, but perhaps worrying that whatever he has is
<b>Floyd</b> | contagious - and grunts, "What's up?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The first guard shrugs and seems to regain some of his strength, but
<b>Floyd</b> | looks around suspiciously, peering at the people closest to him in
<b>Floyd</b> | case one of them might have attacked him. He doesn't notice you at
<b>Floyd</b> | all.

<b>Floyd</b> | As you step through the doorway, it flashes brightly - and an alarm
<b>Floyd</b> | sounds!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Gallery</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Exits: None!</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Paintings line the walls here, each mounted in a very elaborate frame
<b>Floyd</b> | and bearing a plaque indicating who painted them. You see works by
<b>Floyd</b> | Nalakorian, Stropsis and Makeb to name but three - famous painters
<b>Floyd</b> | all. A thief could make a fortune emptying the contents of this room.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Magical barriers drop down to the east and northwest, blocking off all
<b>Floyd</b> | exits from the gallery.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An alarm bell sounds - strident and blaring! Malakar is alerted to
<b>Floyd</b> | your presence and guards have been dispatched to hunt you down. Things
<b>Floyd</b> | aren't looking good for you right now.
<b>Floyd</b> |

</b><b>Floyd</b> | Everything seems to stop. After a few moments, a previously unseen
<b>Floyd</b> | door opens and into the room walks a man with a cloak covering his
<b>Floyd</b> | head. He comes over to you and says, "Ah, well done. Well done indeed.
<b>Floyd</b> | You've reached the end of the introduction and unfortunately you can't
<b>Floyd</b> | progress any further right now because the rest of the game has yet to
<b>Floyd</b> | be written. But not to fear, when the competition is over and the
<b>Floyd</b> | author stops wasting time on other projects which probably won't ever
<b>Floyd</b> | be finished no matter how much he insists otherwise and gets back to
<b>Floyd</b> | writing <span class="floydstyle em">this</span> one, it will be finished. Hopefully anyway. For
<b>Floyd</b> | now, thanks muchly for playing and I hope you enjoyed it."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With that, the cloaked man disappears along with the door he entered
<b>Floyd</b> | through, and leaves you alone in the gallery.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, that blows," you mutter. "I wonder what happens next…"
