The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>The Best Man</i>, written by Rob Menke.  <I>The Best Man</I> was released as part of the 2000 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took fifteenth place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/The_Best_Man'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | Amazing! After all these years some girl finally got Jack to propose.
<b>Floyd</b> | All you need to do is hop on a commuter plane, get the big lug to the
<b>Floyd</b> | church on time, and zip back. Piece of cake...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Well, almost.  Blasted El Ni?o has air traffic in an uproar. This
<b>Floyd</b> | daily commuter flight out of San Francisco was delayed three times,

<b>Floyd</b> | Rob Menke (author) -- Rob has been interested in adventure games ever
<b>Floyd</b> | since he played "Zork I" on an old Apple ][ back in the early '80s. He
<b>Floyd</b> | is often tempted to add "Finished 'Stationfall' in a four-day marathon
<b>Floyd</b> | session" to his resume. "The Best Man" is his first interactive
<b>Floyd</b> | fiction game for use by the general public. Please direct all bug
<b>Floyd</b> | reports to his interim mailing address robmenke@mac.com (Rob is in the
<b>Floyd</b> | process of changing ISPs so response may be delayed.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Christopher Livingston (playability, details) -- That you can use
<b>Floyd</b> | "lube" as a verb and propose to the conductor are both thanks to
<b>Floyd</b> | Chris. All IF authors should be as lucky to have a tester as disturbed
<b>Floyd</b> | as he is. You are encouraged to visit his web site:
<b>Floyd</b> | [<A HREF="http://www.notmydesk.com/">LINK</A>]
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Mark Rosenfelder (continuity, structure) -- The closing sequence was
<b>Floyd</b> | completely rewritten at the request of Mark, who felt its silly tone
<b>Floyd</b> | conflicted with the rather graphic endgame. The task-oriented nature
<b>Floyd</b> | of the hints are his brainchild; they assume less and provide more.
<b>Floyd</b> | More info about Mark can be found at:
<b>Floyd</b> | [<A HREF="http://www.zompist.com/">LINK</A>]
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Other testing performed by: Greg Galcik, Heather Garvey.

<b>Floyd</b> | Sole survivor syndrome.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | That's what they call it. Psychological trauma after surviving an
<b>Floyd</b> | accident that killed so many others.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You still can't look at a plane without hearing the screaming or
<b>Floyd</b> | smelling the blood. The last time you tried to visit an airport-- just
<b>Floyd</b> | to pick up someone-- you left in an ambulance, catatonic.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Things were looking bad when the old rust bucket died this morning.
<b>Floyd</b> | The mechanic said that the earliest he could get to it was first thing
<b>Floyd</b> | Monday morning, and the rental agency just laughed when you asked if
<b>Floyd</b> | you could get a car on short notice for the weekend. Flight was out of
<b>Floyd</b> | the question for obvious reasons, but rail had existed far earlier
<b>Floyd</b> | than planes. So you found yourself pleading your case to a sympathetic

<b>Floyd</b> | Two years ago, the wedding was postponed indefinitely by your

<b>Floyd</b> | A bright blue flash illuminates the entire west side of the airplane,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For a brief moment, everything is silent as the situation slowly sinks

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It's all your fault, you know."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your traveling companion turns to face you, and you recoil in horror.
<b>Floyd</b> | The left side of his face is horribly mutilated, the skin torn and
<b>Floyd</b> | burnt. The empty eye socket stares at you accusingly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Why did you have to survive? I had a family, a child... they depended

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He leans forward, and you can smell the horrid odor of burnt flesh.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Nothing..."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You still can't look at a plane without hearing the screaming or

<b>Floyd</b> | Darkroom
<b>Floyd</b> | This lavatory has been converted into a makeshift darkroom. (I guess
<b>Floyd</b> | some photographers haven't joined the "digital revolution.") All the
<b>Floyd</b> | windows have been painted black, a loose conglomeration of items rest
<b>Floyd</b> | on a crude shelf, while a workbench sits under a naked electrical
<b>Floyd</b> | fixture.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The darkroom door allows exit east.

<b>Floyd</b> | All you need to do is hop on a commuter plane, get the big lug to the
<b>Floyd</b> | church on time, and zip back. Piece of cake...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Well, almost.  Blasted El Ni?o has air traffic in an uproar. This
<b>Floyd</b> | daily commuter flight out of San Francisco was delayed three times,
<b>Floyd</b> | which will make life fun when you finally make it down to San Diego...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Airplane (on Seat 4B)
<b>Floyd</b> | The airlines claim that planes are getting bigger, but you don't
<b>Floyd</b> | believe a word of it. This cramped cabin feels about as roomy as a
<b>Floyd</b> | culvert, and has approximately the same decor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a door south and a small kitchenette north.

<b>Floyd</b> | Once inside, you realize why this car wasn't accessible from the rest

<b>Floyd</b> | exit.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In front of you stands a large metal box, closed on all sides save the
