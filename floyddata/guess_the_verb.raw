The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Guess the Verb!</i>, written by Leonard Richardson.  <i>Guess the Verb!</i> was originally released as part of the 2000 IF Competition, where it took eleventh place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Guess_the_Verb!"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

<b>Floyd</b> | Verb Guessing Booth

<b>Floyd</b> | The cramped, brightly-lit booth before which you stand is the field of
<b>Floyd</b> | play for a carnival game with the improbable name of "Guess The Verb".
<b>Floyd</b> | Lalrry, the jovial natural language parser inside the booth,
<b>Floyd</b> | broadcasts a well-rehearsed patter promising great prizes and fun for
<b>Floyd</b> | all ages; high adventure and unbridled kleptomania. The rest of the
<b>Floyd</b> | carnival midway lies to the northeast, and you can scamper behind the

<b>Floyd</b> | booth to the southeast.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A large wheel of fortune is attached to the booth behind the counter,
<b>Floyd</b> | each of its five equally-sized divisions labeled with a single word:
<b>Floyd</b> | SCRUTINIZE, RECONFIGURE, FASTEN, DISEMBARK, and UNDO.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | As your fleshy eye momentarily catches Lalrry's roving, metallic one,
<b>Floyd</b> | you suddenly become his most important (not to mention only) potential
<b>Floyd</b> | customer. Lights flash on his status panel as he loads a new pitch
<b>Floyd</b> | into extended memory.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Hello, little boy or girl!", bellows Lalrry in the alarming tone used

<b>Floyd</b> | by adults who are trying to be friendly. "Wait a minute... are you a
<b>Floyd</b> | boy or a girl? Are you a BOY or a GIRL?"

<b>Floyd</b> | his old banter with an occasional hopeful glance in your direction.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | The parser looks much the way Peter Norton would look if Peter Norton
<b>Floyd</b> | were made of stainless steel and had, instead of a head, an Ethernet
<b>Floyd</b> | hub with two small surveillance cameras attached on top and a speaker
<b>Floyd</b> | attached underneath. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the parser

<b>Floyd</b> | is wearing a shirt and a tie.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He's also wearing a straw hat and a nametag that says "Hello! My name
<b>Floyd</b> | is LALRRY." A series of lights in his forehead monitor the traffic
<b>Floyd</b> | that flows through an Ethernet cable plugged into where Peter Norton's
<b>Floyd</b> | left cheek would be, which cable disappears down into the booth.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As a natural language parser, Lalrry can deal with a reasonable subset
<b>Floyd</b> | of some human language (English, in his case), through some
<b>Floyd</b> | combination of recursive grammars and ad-hoc tricks. Most such parsers
<b>Floyd</b> | were created in the 1980s to answer queries and to help people find
<b>Floyd</b> | treasures and kill trolls. Nowadays, most parsers are working at Web

<b>Floyd</b> | start-ups. The fact that Lalrry is working as a carnival barker does
<b>Floyd</b> | not say much for his language handling capabilities.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Step right up, step right up!", says Lalrry with perfectly
<b>Floyd</b> | synthesized heartiness.

<b>Floyd</b> | wheel indicates one of the five verbs at random (currently
<b>Floyd</b> | SCRUTINIZE), and will do so again when Lalrry spins the wheel. The
<b>Floyd</b> | verbs currently on the pie chart are SCRUTINIZE, RECONFIGURE, FASTEN,
<b>Floyd</b> | DISEMBARK, and UNDO, each taking up an equal slice of the pie.

<b>Floyd</b> | carnival booths. The music and bustle of the midway seems very far
<b>Floyd</b> | away, and a harvest moon illuminates the wet grass of the fairgrounds
<b>Floyd</b> | and the makeshift walls that surround you.

<b>Floyd</b> | Verb Guessing Booth

<b>Floyd</b> | The cramped, brightly-lit booth before which you stand is the field of
<b>Floyd</b> | play for a carnival game with the improbable name of "Guess The Verb".
<b>Floyd</b> | Lalrry, the jovial natural language parser inside the booth,
<b>Floyd</b> | broadcasts a well-rehearsed patter promising great prizes and fun for
<b>Floyd</b> | all ages; high adventure and unbridled kleptomania. The rest of the
<b>Floyd</b> | carnival midway lies to the northeast, and you can scamper behind the

<b>Floyd</b> | booth to the southeast.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A large wheel of fortune is attached to the booth behind the counter,
<b>Floyd</b> | each of its five equally-sized divisions labeled with a single word:
<b>Floyd</b> | SCRUTINIZE, RECONFIGURE, FASTEN, DISEMBARK, and UNDO.

<b>Floyd</b> | The lights and noise of the midway seem hollow and dull compared to

<b>Floyd</b> | though a ham-handed author were trying to place hints into the room
<b>Floyd</b> | description that the game would progress a lot faster if you went back

<b>Floyd</b> | to the verb guessing booth already.

<b>Floyd</b> | the quarter shining machine has taken to mimicry, hoping to trap

<b>Floyd</b> | fate in another machine.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Its innards are exposed, an unnecessarily complicated mesh of shiny
<b>Floyd</b> | gears and pistons. A prominent notice on the side of the machine
<b>Floyd</b> | assures you with alarming urgency that the practice of quarter-shining
<b>Floyd</b> | is legal under federal statute BH-2510958. The coin tray has two
<b>Floyd</b> | quarter-shaped slots; the left one to contain payment and the right to

<b>Floyd</b> | contain the quarter you want shined and dropped into the receptacle
<b>Floyd</b> | near the bottom of the machine.

<b>Floyd</b> | Verb Guessing Booth

<b>Floyd</b> | The cramped, brightly-lit booth before which you stand is the field of
<b>Floyd</b> | play for a carnival game with the improbable name of "Guess The Verb".
<b>Floyd</b> | Lalrry, the jovial natural language parser inside the booth,
<b>Floyd</b> | broadcasts a well-rehearsed patter promising great prizes and fun for
<b>Floyd</b> | all ages; high adventure and unbridled kleptomania. The rest of the
<b>Floyd</b> | carnival midway lies to the northeast, and you can scamper behind the

<b>Floyd</b> | booth to the southeast.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A large wheel of fortune is attached to the booth behind the counter,
<b>Floyd</b> | each of its five equally-sized divisions labeled with a single word:
<b>Floyd</b> | SCRUTINIZE, RECONFIGURE, FASTEN, DISEMBARK, and UNDO.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You shrug too, and try to look nonchalant, but you feel a hollowness

<b>Floyd</b> | something, and blink to clear the glare from your eyes.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Suddenly you are falling.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You claw at the air, then at the unidentifiable blurs that race past
<b>Floyd</b> | you, then at your own body, which is unaccountably absent from this

<b>Floyd</b> | scream which never quite materializes, and then with the feeling of
<b>Floyd</b> | suddenly waking up from a nightmare, you are somewhere else.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And a little dwarf is in the room with you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | **********************************************************************

<b>Floyd</b> | **********
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He's relatively young, as dwarves go; only about a hundred or so. At
<b>Floyd</b> | first he starts, surprised to meet a human one-on-one, but he quickly
<b>Floyd</b> | remembers his manners, and, doffing his miner's helmet, bows low.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Duran son of Czadhan, at your service."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You return the bow to the extent your heavy sack will allow. "Isqui,
<b>Floyd</b> | at yours."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "By the load you bear," says he, indicating his own bulging backpack,
<b>Floyd</b> | "I see the factors that brought me to scenic Wyrmsworth Caverns have

<b>Floyd</b> | been at work upon you as well."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Love of the underground realms," you reply.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Duran nods, and, with a twinkle in his eye, acknowledges the one
<b>Floyd</b> | strongest commonality, so often unstated, between human and dwarf.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "And greed."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Slate Room
<b>Floyd</b> | The floor of this room is covered with shattered pieces of slate,
<b>Floyd</b> | peeled off from the ceiling above. The glow of your lantern is

<b>Floyd</b> | swallowed up by the dark material of which the ceiling, floor, and
<b>Floyd</b> | walls are made. There is a wide, rounded portal to the northwest, a
<b>Floyd</b> | narrower entrance to the south, and a passage to the north which opens
<b>Floyd</b> | up after a little way.

<b>Floyd</b> | Verb Guessing Booth
<b>Floyd</b> | The cramped, brightly-lit booth before which you stand is the field of
<b>Floyd</b> | play for a carnival game with the improbable name of "Guess The Verb".
<b>Floyd</b> | Lalrry, the jovial natural language parser inside the booth,
<b>Floyd</b> | broadcasts a well-rehearsed patter promising great prizes and fun for

<b>Floyd</b> | all ages; high adventure and unbridled kleptomania. The rest of the
<b>Floyd</b> | carnival midway lies to the northeast, and you can scamper behind the
<b>Floyd</b> | booth to the southeast.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A large wheel of fortune is attached to the booth behind the counter,
<b>Floyd</b> | each of its three equally-sized divisions labeled with a single word:

<b>Floyd</b> | SCRUTINIZE, DISEMBARK, and UNDO.

<b>Floyd</b> | From beyond the valley of the dead, you hear a voice:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It's a good thing your daughter was wearing that emergency bracelet.
<b>Floyd</b> | Otherwise, who knows how I would have reached you."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You hear another voice, your mother's. "Is she okay?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "She's right in here, ma'am."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You open your eyes.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Inside the Booth (on the canvas cot)
<b>Floyd</b> | Inside, the small booth is a mess of blinking lights and
<b>Floyd</b> | interconnected black boxes. There are no prizes here; only the noun
<b>Floyd</b> | disambiguators, verb-to-action sequencers, and speech synthesizers
<b>Floyd</b> | that help Lalrry make sense of the world.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Your parents are standing over you, looking down with expressions of
<b>Floyd</b> | concern. They are greatly relieved to see your eyes open. Your father
<b>Floyd</b> | stoops down and, in the absence of any objection from Lalrry, lifts
<b>Floyd</b> | you up into a bear hug.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "How's it going, sporto?", he asks. "Okay," you reply, rubbing your

<b>Floyd</b> | eyes. "I guess I just fainted."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, all's well that ends well, I suppose," says your mother
<b>Floyd</b> | stiffly. Come on, Isqui, let's take you home."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |     *** You have been reunited with your parents ***

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In that game, you guessed 1 verb and completed 2 scenarios, in 95
<b>Floyd</b> | moves.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game or QUIT?

<b>Floyd</b> | Warlock's Study
<b>Floyd</b> | The sumptuously decorated study of Do'papoc is decorated in
<b>Floyd</b> | bookshelves, full of tomes radiating power. A large, bone-white candle
<b>Floyd</b> | drips wax onto an oaken table, shedding light on a large, ancient
<b>Floyd</b> | spellbook and a terribly inaccurate globe.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | An aged man dressed in black robes sits at the table. Looking up from
<b>Floyd</b> | his book, he chuckles, shaking his head.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You poor, miserable fool!", he says. "If only you had found the
<b>Floyd</b> | obnoxious parrot, preparing beforehand with the funyun, bismol, and
<b>Floyd</b> | formic spells... then you may have stood a chance against me! But now,

<b>Floyd</b> | the might of the brussel spell will turn you into 7,904 individually
<b>Floyd</b> | wrapped jawbreakers!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Before you can react, the warlock casts a spell at you! It tingles a
<b>Floyd</b> | bit, but its most noticeable effect is its complete and utter failure
<b>Floyd</b> | at turning you into so many as ten individually wrapped jawbreakers.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Do'papoc looks extremely embarrassed and hastily consults the online
<b>Floyd</b> | documentation for the brussel spell. "Blast!", he spouts, tearing at
<b>Floyd</b> | his beard. "The brussel spell is for ages 12 and up! Local Sorcerers
<b>Floyd</b> | 503 was clever to send a mere child to do battle with me!" Reaching
<b>Floyd</b> | for his spellbook, the warlock becomes calmer and more pensive. "No

<b>Floyd</b> | matter," he muses with a snarl. "I'll simply make use of 'brussel
<b>Floyd</b> | junior', the brussel spell for the younger set!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Do'papoc turns to his book and begins furiously memorizing a spell!
<b>Floyd</b> | You've only got one shot at this--whatever you do, it'd better be
<b>Floyd</b> | good!

<b>Floyd</b> | preparations for his spell.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Do'papoc points at you and utters a word of power: "bokbar!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Unsurprisingly, nothing happens. The bokbar spell is "turn human into
<b>Floyd</b> | parrot", and since there is already a parrot in the vicinity, the

<b>Floyd</b> | enchantment has no effect. (Wow, I guess those arbitrary, inconvenient
<b>Floyd</b> | limitations on spells cut both ways!)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Do'papoc is not pleased, and, shamelessly disregarding the rules of
<b>Floyd</b> | turn-based magical combat, casts another spell at you. Suddenly, a
<b>Floyd</b> | sheepish-looking goblin carrying a dagger appears and cowers in the

<b>Floyd</b> | corner. "Kill!", demands the warlock, pointing at you, and the
<b>Floyd</b> | whimpering goblin begins a valiant attempt to approach you menacingly
<b>Floyd</b> | without ever reducing the distance between you and him.

<b>Floyd</b> | and your pathetic but exceedingly well-chosen spells with one mighty
<b>Floyd</b> | blow!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Reaching into his pocket, Do'papoc tosses a handful of magical dust
<b>Floyd</b> | into the air, speaking a summons of great power -- "borax!"
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The dust explodes, filling the air with smoke, and from the billowing
<b>Floyd</b> | black clouds emerges a bronzed warrior, clad in equally bronze mail
<b>Floyd</b> | and carrying a decidedly steely bast--er, broadsword. He looks at you
<b>Floyd</b> | with a smirk, and, nodding his head in acknowledgement of an unheard

<b>Floyd</b> | "Look at you, young man!" The old woman, dressed in drab reds and
<b>Floyd</b> | flamboyant necklaces, is not pleased. "Going out without a shirt! What
<b>Floyd</b> | are you trying to do, die of cold? Maybe give your mother a heart

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The aged woman grabs Do'papoc and her son in an ear lock (she may be
