The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>The People's Glorious Revolutionary Text Adventure Game</i>, written by Taylor Vaughan.  <I>The People's Glorious Revolutionary Text Adventure Game</I> was originally released as part of the 2010 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took seventh place. At the time of posting this transcript, it has been nominated for a Xyzzy Award for Best Puzzles, though the winner has not yet been announced.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/The_People's_Glorious_Revolutionary_Text_Adventure_Game'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.
