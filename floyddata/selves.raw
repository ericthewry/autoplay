The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of IntroComp09.  The transcript includes the (very short) awards ceremony that was held on ifMUD to announce the competition's winners, plus ClubFloyd transcripts of the three entries.  You can learn more about the competition by visiting <A HREF='http://www.allthingsjacq.com/introcomp.html'><u>the IntroCom</u>p<u> </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e on AllThin</u>g<u>sJac</u>q<u>.com</u></A>.</br></br>
NOTE: Due to the unique nature of this transcript, I opted to leave in a couple of other channels that are normally omitted: Peanut-Gallery and CFSpoilers.  The script used to process transcripts isn't programmed to look for these channels, so they've been integrated with the normally chat-free room text.  I'm open to feedback on this, but do not at this time plan to include such extra discussion in the future.</br></br>

A collection of invitations to the ceremony is stacked neatly in a corner; they seem to have been printed but not mailed.

<b>Floyd</b> | By the Lake
<b>Floyd</b> | The cold finally manages to break through the haze, and forces your

<b>Floyd</b> | above.  The path leading home lies to the east, while an unknown path

<b>Floyd</b> | Deeply absorbed in your thoughts, remembering yesterday's party, you

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Ah, here's the boss.  Sammy, coat and briefcase in hand, smiles at

<b>Floyd</b> | "How are you doing ?"
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, I drank a bit too much yesterday at a cocktail party, but it's

<b>Floyd</b> | stop it."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You smile: more than once you have had feverish discussions with
<b>Floyd</b> | Sammy, and sometimes about this topic. He keeps saying that, speaking
<b>Floyd</b> | of magazine sales, men don't want to know about defects of sexually
<b>Floyd</b> | arousing blonde babes, while women are more interested in them. You
<b>Floyd</b> | argue that trying to reach women this way contributes to making them
<b>Floyd</b> | feel guilty by childishly pointing at little imperfections and
<b>Floyd</b> | reffering to them as defects. He argues that it's a way to break the
<b>Floyd</b> | ideology of the perfect woman that every media wants to create and
<b>Floyd</b> | make you believe in. This could go on for hours - you both are equally
<b>Floyd</b> | stubborn - and nobody is gonna change their mind. You both decided to
<b>Floyd</b> | limit the frequency of such discussions. He's the boss, he decides,
<b>Floyd</b> | you execute; but meanwhile you prepare new arguments for the next of
<b>Floyd</b> | these delightful conversations...

<b>Floyd</b> | say that they are against this press, the paparazzis and their
<b>Floyd</b> | incursions in their private life; but when you dig a little deeper,
<b>Floyd</b> | you find out that a substantial part of the information you're dealing
<b>Floyd</b> | with is provided by the celebrities themselves, and a lot of rumors
<b>Floyd</b> | were invented and spread by these little perfect smiling people.
<b>Floyd</b> | Gossip magazines are, for them, a way to harm a rival, to make people
<b>Floyd</b> | talk about them, to appear kind and sympathetic and closer to the
<b>Floyd</b> | average person because they go to the grocer just like them. You
<b>Floyd</b> | sometimes wonder if the journalists themselves aren't the most lucid

<b>Floyd</b> | but the magazine is keen to show that it's different, by precisely,
<b>Floyd</b> | and in a clear-headed way, analyzing information, and explaining what
<b>Floyd</b> | it really means. Tracking a shameless rumor to reveal its creator,
<b>Floyd</b> | analyzing a sentence said by a star to show the true intent, showing

<b>Floyd</b> | favorite address: a shop that often sells things you like. You often
<b>Floyd</b> | come here; some of the sales assistants ended up knowing your name. In

<b>Floyd</b> | popular night club where the celebrities like to go; they like him,
<b>Floyd</b> | and he warmly welcomes them. This eccentric man is famous for his pink
<b>Floyd</b> | clothes with feathers on them - his signature clothes. Apart from
<b>Floyd</b> | that, he appeared in some movies, and sang on a record now
<b>Floyd</b> | long-forgotten. To be frank, you don't really like his old useless
<b>Floyd</b> | jet-setter trying to remaining famous by making people or gossip
<b>Floyd</b> | magazines talk about him at any cost - you are very careful to ignore

<b>Floyd</b> | Tyrone and the suspicions about his fidelity... Well, if you believe

<b>Floyd</b> | tonight. Do you confirm this info?"
<b>Floyd</b> | You nod.
<b>Floyd</b> | "I think it could be good to send you there, don't you?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You sigh. Tyrone is a problem man, he already has this reputation, and
<b>Floyd</b> | what good will it be to write an article about his adultery? Put some
<b>Floyd</b> | more weight upon his shoulders, distract the housewife for a few
<b>Floyd</b> | seconds, but it won't change anything, and you don't like to hound a
<b>Floyd</b> | man like this... On the other hand, you really don't like Piranella,
<b>Floyd</b> | and it all depends on the way you write the article; you can probably
<b>Floyd</b> | make it more harmful to her than to Tyrone... In either cases, you
<b>Floyd</b> | don't like your position, because the only purpose of such a report is

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A few years ago, with an impulsive character, you'd have rebelled

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Whether sadness, misery, horror or confusion, They never fail to
<b>Floyd</b> | induce negativity; in that, at least, this dream is no different. You
<b>Floyd</b> | float in void, filled with a roiling black static that seems
<b>Floyd</b> | conscious. There is nothing to see but the static, nothing to feel but
<b>Floyd</b> | your own form, and nothing to hear but the ghostly call of a child. It
<b>Floyd</b> | sets your teeth on edge even in the waking world; you can't stand that
<b>Floyd</b> | eerie wail, wavering between laughter and tears.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You never find this child. Even though the sound gets closer, until it
<b>Floyd</b> | is right next to you, all around you, inside your own head before you
<b>Floyd</b> | are awakened by the alarm clock.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This time, though...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A figure swims out of the darkness, backlit, so that you can only make
<b>Floyd</b> | out a childlike face of tragic innocence and flowing hair.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Who... are you?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There isn't an answer right away--instead, everything around you turns
<b>Floyd</b> | completely white. And somehow... puffy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Do you know WHY you have always hated the sound, Kristen? The child,
<b>Floyd</b> | invisible now, speaks, for the first time; androgynous, cultured. You
<b>Floyd</b> | can't respond. you wish you could. It just sparks something deep
<b>Floyd</b> | within you, something primal--something below reason, below
<b>Floyd</b> | rationality, below everything but fear. You don't like it when your
<b>Floyd</b> | brain keeps secrets from you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I've waited a long time... and still am. Your surroundings flicker
<b>Floyd</b> | between the endless white and writhing black, the two merging into
<b>Floyd</b> | some unwholesome gray. Kristen... your child is waiting.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Your child is waiting."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Hmm?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I said, your child is waiting."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "WHAT?" You blinked furiously, trying to get your brain into some
<b>Floyd</b> | sense of working order; these dreams usually leave you a scattered
<b>Floyd</b> | mess, and you can't recall ever speaking to someone while that way.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I said--" The voice seemed testy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "No--stop. I heard what you said, I just... could you give me a
<b>Floyd</b> | moment?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You looked around... same bedroom, same lame-ass apartment, same
<b>Floyd</b> | everything... Awake. Normal. Except, not. You'd managed to register
<b>Floyd</b> | your ringing phone, pick it up, and get through the opener to this
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation, while sleeping. Not very like you. And she said--
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You felt a chill. "...Excuse me? Did you say that I have a--"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Child, yes ma'am--waiting for you in Gainesville." Click.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I don't have a..." The retort died on your lips. The hum of a
<b>Floyd</b> | disconnected telephone answered back at you, daring you to question
<b>Floyd</b> | its integrity.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Patently ridiculous. You don't have a child. You never did. How could
<b>Floyd</b> | that possibly be? There must be some mistake, some incredibly stupid
<b>Floyd</b> | bureaucratic snafu. You'd love nothing better than to explain this
<b>Floyd</b> | fact to whoever that was, but since she hung up before you could get
<b>Floyd</b> | the words out, that's not really an option.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | That dream...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Was a dream. You dream every night, and you haven't had any come true
<b>Floyd</b> | yet. Gainesville? Where is Gainesville? Most bloody generic name for a
<b>Floyd</b> | town ever, and you don't even recall there being one here. You
<b>Floyd</b> | wouldn't even know where it is.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Except... you do. The way suggested itself even as you tried to deny
<b>Floyd</b> | it, as though you had always known. You're still certain, completely,
<b>Floyd</b> | that you've never heard of the place before; even the part of your
<b>Floyd</b> | brain that showed you the way confirms this.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the end, you don't know what your motivation was: sleep
<b>Floyd</b> | deprivation, deep seated confusion, nerves... maybe your body was just
<b>Floyd</b> | tired of waiting for your brain to catch up and got you dressed and in
<b>Floyd</b> | the car before you realized. Soon you were driving, to where you
<b>Floyd</b> | weren't sure, your mind screaming MADNESS while your hands deftly
<b>Floyd</b> | twisted the steering wheel. This would bother you, give you serious
<b>Floyd</b> | pause, but you somehow feel at peace with it. All you've gotta do is
<b>Floyd</b> | remind yourself that you had nothing else planned today.

<b>Floyd</b> | An Interactive Fiction by Drew and Johnny
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 1 / Serial number 090829 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib
<b>Floyd</b> | 6/12N)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You stand up and stretch, various parts of your body making worrisome
<b>Floyd</b> | popping noises as you exit the car, noting with a vague sense of
<b>Floyd</b> | triumph that it has once again failed to cause your violent death in
<b>Floyd</b> | some spectacular fashion or other. The cold night air is chill against
<b>Floyd</b> | your skin--fortunate, then, that you brought your coat.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Outskirts of Gainesville
<b>Floyd</b> | You stand on the side of the packed dirt road leading to Gainesville.
<b>Floyd</b> | The road stretches far away behind you to the south and, eventually,
<b>Floyd</b> | turns off into a paved one that leads back to the central transit
<b>Floyd</b> | explosion that is modern American transportation. Your vision of the
<b>Floyd</b> | town is obscured by the trees; all you can tell is that the path
<b>Floyd</b> | leads, for now, to the north.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your next-to useless, banged-up car is decidedly parked here. The
<b>Floyd</b> | driver's side door is shut smugly in your face.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Not as clever as you thought you were. Are ya?"

<b>Floyd</b> | frightened beyond measure; also if you listen to this you will lose

<b>Floyd</b> | box with your hands. The first hint of a give, the acknowledgment of
<b>Floyd</b> | weakness fills you with triumph. You bash at the lid repeatedly,
<b>Floyd</b> | refusing to give up until finally it starts to crack... and a fine
<b>Floyd</b> | dust begins to filter through. You wait for it to stop, but it never
<b>Floyd</b> | does. Not even when it covers your stomach and starts flowing towards
<b>Floyd</b> | your mouth--and still, no light. Oh GOD. It suddenly hits you, you

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With a burst of furious determination, you smash your fist one last

<b>Floyd</b> | enough. Cursing your height in the back of your mind you claw

<b>Floyd</b> | dominates your thoughts: UP. You tilt your head back, lungs burning,
<b>Floyd</b> | trying to spring off the wrecked boards. Your support sinks
<b>Floyd</b> | sickeningly further down into the ground but you are still able to
<b>Floyd</b> | make some sort of half-assed arching movement, just enough for your

<b>Floyd</b> | throwing your arms out in front of you, digging them into the soft
<b>Floyd</b> | earth as gravity pulls at that fucking trench coat and all the
<b>Floyd</b> | pointless useless shit in it. Your face twists itself into a rictus of
<b>Floyd</b> | determination as you rip your fingernails bloody, fighting against the
<b>Floyd</b> | weight of the earth tumbling you back into the open grave. The first
<b>Floyd</b> | few inches are the hardest ones to manage, but you do manage them, and
<b>Floyd</b> | then a few more, slowly but surely extricating yourself from the pit,
<b>Floyd</b> | just enough to allow you the leverage to push down and free your legs.
<b>Floyd</b> | You roll over onto your back, hands and feet scrabbling wildly,
<b>Floyd</b> | propelling your body away from the unstable boundaries of the hole
<b>Floyd</b> | even as it shifts and fills itself.

<b>Floyd</b> | commemorating the graves. It doesn't take you long before you realize

<b>Floyd</b> | though, sure enough--and next to it--!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Oh, God.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Rustle, Will--L. May 16th, 1983--D. September 8th, 1998. Cause of
<b>Floyd</b> | death: auto accident."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You remember him, of course. You'll never forget the last time you
<b>Floyd</b> | kissed him: at the funeral, in his coffin. the material of his shirt,
<b>Floyd</b> | the stillness of his chest, the deathly pallor of his skin--dry, and
<b>Floyd</b> | cold as ice. Sometimes, you feel it so vividly in a dream that when
<b>Floyd</b> | you wake up, you think it's happening again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And right next to his grave... "Dreyfus, Michael. B. June 3rd,
<b>Floyd</b> | 1983--D. June 3rd, 2004. Cause of death: auto accident."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You remember what it was like getting the call that evening. The
<b>Floyd</b> | denial that flooded through you, followed by the dull emptiness of the
<b>Floyd</b> | space that opened up in you, and everyone who knew him. You remember
<b>Floyd</b> | his parents, your friends, huddled close around his casket. God, how
<b>Floyd</b> | horrible... You can't help but wonder--did he know? In those last few
<b>Floyd</b> | minutes, when he felt control slipping from him, did he realize that
<b>Floyd</b> | his time had come? Was he afraid? And what does he know now that we do
<b>Floyd</b> | not? Did he feel pain? Does it haunt him every day of his spiritual
<b>Floyd</b> | life, as the memory of his passing haunts those he left behind?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can't look anymore. God fucking dammit, what is this? Is this some
<b>Floyd</b> | sort of purgatory? Are you dead, now, and this is what it's like? Or
<b>Floyd</b> | is this just another dream? You're sick of it. Absolutely, utterly,
<b>Floyd</b> | sick to fucking death of dreams.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Others call you the rock, the emotional center of their universe. How
<b>Floyd</b> | can that be possible when you can't even begin to reconcile with your
<b>Floyd</b> | own past? What makes you so special that the images, sensations, pain,
<b>Floyd</b> | and emotions all stay with you, even to this day? You'd think you'd
<b>Floyd</b> | work through it, get past it, but no. That would be normal. Expected.
<b>Floyd</b> | The right way for things to happen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Marcus gives you a cold look as the weight of all that's happened to
<b>Floyd</b> | you sinks in again. "Now do you understand?" he asks, quietly. "This

<b>Floyd</b> | know the answer." He sighs. "I guess I've just never bothered to care
<b>Floyd</b> | before. I mean, what's the point? You don't do a lot when you're dead.
<b>Floyd</b> | Oh, sure, you can spy on all those nubile young ladies in the shower

<b>Floyd</b> | back down.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Do you... think that you can?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well that's the question, in'nit?" Marcus weighs your question for a

<b>Floyd</b> | dry look. "There's always a first time for everything." You start to
<b>Floyd</b> | smile.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And then, it happens.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a rush of wind that almost knocks you down--Marcus, looking
<b>Floyd</b> | behind you, sees it first and his eyes become as wide as dinner
<b>Floyd</b> | plates. You whip around to find out what's happening--and come face to
<b>Floyd</b> | face with the likes of something you have never before witnessed in
<b>Floyd</b> | any of your worst nightmares.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For a frightening few moments your brain refuses to let you see what's
<b>Floyd</b> | right in front of your eyes clearly, however, it comes into focus soon
<b>Floyd</b> | enough. The thing's green-and-yellow skin is stretched taught over a
<b>Floyd</b> | collection of moving parts that look like they've been slapped
<b>Floyd</b> | together by a God gone mad. You can see things--ranging from gray
<b>Floyd</b> | tumorous growths to unidentifiable red streaks that glisten
<b>Floyd</b> | wetly--sliding around underneath the skin. It stands on six legs,
<b>Floyd</b> | making it look like a giant squatting insect. Each leg terminates with
<b>Floyd</b> | a long, silvery, wicked-looking prong that glints in the moonlight
<b>Floyd</b> | with what must be poison. Acidic-looking drool falls from the
<b>Floyd</b> | creature's open mouth filled with teeth as sharp as needles. It
<b>Floyd</b> | exhales, forcing you to step back and cough--it's as if the vapor
<b>Floyd</b> | actively seeks to burn out your lungs. The creature looks ill at ease
<b>Floyd</b> | on the ground, seeming more accustomed to flying with the huge
<b>Floyd</b> | jet-black wings sticking straight out from it's sides, flapping slowly
<b>Floyd</b> | and powerfully. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this thing,
<b>Floyd</b> | however, is that there appear to be no eyes on its face, and yet it is
<b>Floyd</b> | most definitely staring straight at you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Marcus lets out a yell that is mixed parts anguish and frustration.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Of course! Of course, just as soon as I start thinking about it it
<b>Floyd</b> | fucking comes back! Do you see, Kristen? Do you see what I have to

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well," he says, cold eyes boring into your face with an unmistakable
<b>Floyd</b> | air of malevolence. "Well... well well." He looks you up and down,
<b>Floyd</b> | taking in the disheveled state of your clothes; the dirt you've
<b>Floyd</b> | tracked all over the church floor. He just sighs. "You know, I miss

<b>Floyd</b> | "Get your FUCKING hands off me you *cretin*--"

<b>Floyd</b> | normal circumstances you're quite certain it would have broken his
<b>Floyd</b> | wrist, but it doesn't seem to have fazed him. "This is a dangerous
<b>Floyd</b> | place. You can die, and there won't even be any carrion to come 'round
<b>Floyd</b> | to strip your bones. Not even the worms will love you. So watch your
<b>Floyd</b> | step, or you'll find yourself back in a 6-foot hole like your doped-up

<b>Floyd</b> | But you just wouldn't have any of it. So off you go."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Quick as a flash, his hand lets go of your shoulder to whip towards
<b>Floyd</b> | your face; you lean back to avoid the devastating punch you're sure is
<b>Floyd</b> | coming to break your nose, and his fist closes over your chin. His
<b>Floyd</b> | fingers are like iron; his horse-like face is brought an inch from
<b>Floyd</b> | yours as he hisses at you to open your mouth. You grit your teeth; he
<b>Floyd</b> | slaps you across the face. His strength wins out over your will; his
<b>Floyd</b> | other hand comes out and forces a pill down your throat. You gag with
<b>Floyd</b> | all your might, but it's no good. He releases you, backing up a few
<b>Floyd</b> | steps, wiping off his hands on his robes as if ridding himself of a
<b>Floyd</b> | particularly unseemly form of vermin. You always thought he'd make a
<b>Floyd</b> | great name for himself as a preacher, and damned if he doesn't look
<b>Floyd</b> | the part now. Amazing the things that run through your mind at times

<b>Floyd</b> | You're a Cymbalta child now... Not mine."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | His words echo into the near distances, feeling as if they're
<b>Floyd</b> | traveling a thousand miles to drop into your head. Your father's face
<b>Floyd</b> | morphs into the face on the Christ statue, creating some sort of
<b>Floyd</b> | unwholesome amalgamation, lamps raining fire down upon you as the

<b>Floyd</b> | terrified than he ever has in his life, he slowly, too slowly walks
<b>Floyd</b> | closer to the thing--and then he looks at you, and a sudden warm light
<b>Floyd</b> | of both understanding and resolve fills his eyes. He charges the thing

<b>Floyd</b> | creature, blindsided, still makes no noise even as it lurches
<b>Floyd</b> | sideways, tries to retain its balance, and in the process puts all of
<b>Floyd</b> | its weight on exactly the wrong leg. The unstable hole breaks open;
<b>Floyd</b> | the creature comes very close to seriously injuring both you and
<b>Floyd</b> | Marcus as it flails desperately for balance. There is none to be had,
<b>Floyd</b> | however, as the hole keeps collapsing, sending the creature helplessly
<b>Floyd</b> | further down into what was just a few short minutes ago your own

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Wordlessly, you and Marcus both get busy with the dirt; shoveling it
<b>Floyd</b> | in handfuls, filling the hole as best you can. You don't stop even

<b>Floyd</b> | solid-packed dirt that's almost up to your knees. Then you just stand,
<b>Floyd</b> | exhausted, looking at each other as if not quite sure what to do next.
<b>Floyd</b> | Then, quietly, he looks into your eyes and utters the one word you've
<b>Floyd</b> | wanted to hear from him for so long: "thanks." You nod, silently,
<b>Floyd</b> | unable to speak, tears silently filling your eyes. Marcus gives you a

<b>Floyd</b> | place. You can die, and there won't even be any carrion to come 'round
<b>Floyd</b> | to strip your bones. Not even the worms will love you. So watch your
<b>Floyd</b> | step, or you'll find yourself back in a 6-foot hole like your doped-up
<b>Floyd</b> | fag friend back there." He shakes his head. "Fine fucking company for

<b>Floyd</b> | THEM." He spits with disgust. "We've tried. You know? We really did.
<b>Floyd</b> | But you just wouldn't have any of it. So off you go."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Quick as a flash, his hand lets go of your shoulder to whip towards
<b>Floyd</b> | your face; you lean back to avoid the devastating punch you're sure is
<b>Floyd</b> | coming to break your nose, and his fist closes over your chin. His
<b>Floyd</b> | fingers are like iron; his horse-like face is brought an inch from
<b>Floyd</b> | yours as he hisses at you to open your mouth. You grit your teeth; he
<b>Floyd</b> | slaps you across the face. His strength wins out over your will; his
<b>Floyd</b> | other hand comes out and forces a pill down your throat. You gag with
<b>Floyd</b> | all your might, but it's no good. He releases you, backing up a few
<b>Floyd</b> | steps, wiping off his hands on his robes as if ridding himself of a
<b>Floyd</b> | particularly unseemly form of vermin. You always thought he'd make a
<b>Floyd</b> | great name for himself as a preacher, and damned if he doesn't look
<b>Floyd</b> | the part now. Amazing the things that run through your mind at times
<b>Floyd</b> | like these. As bad as you usually feel for putting him in the
<b>Floyd</b> | hospital, right now you can't think of anything other than how much
<b>Floyd</b> | you wish you'd finished the job.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "That's better, Missy. This'll fix you right up. Now get out of here.
<b>Floyd</b> | You're a Cymbalta child now... Not mine."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | His words echo into the near distances, feeling as if they're
<b>Floyd</b> | traveling a thousand miles to drop into your head. Your father's face
<b>Floyd</b> | morphs into the face on the Christ statue, creating some sort of
<b>Floyd</b> | unwholesome amalgamation, lamps raining fire down upon you as the
<b>Floyd</b> | world turns away. Inside your mind, you hear the church bell... hell's
<b>Floyd</b> | bell... school bell? Oh, right. The bell to end first period, it rang
<b>Floyd</b> | right before everything really went to shit. Good times.

<b>Floyd</b> | Dreams, coming again and again, always unwelcome, always unwanted...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Whether sadness, misery, horror or confusion, They never fail to
<b>Floyd</b> | induce negativity; in that, at least, this dream is no different. You
<b>Floyd</b> | float in void, filled with a roiling black static that seems
<b>Floyd</b> | conscious. There is nothing to see but the static, nothing to feel but
<b>Floyd</b> | your own form, and nothing to hear but the ghostly call of a child. It
<b>Floyd</b> | sets your teeth on edge even in the waking world; you can't stand that
<b>Floyd</b> | eerie wail, wavering between laughter and tears.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You never find this child. Even though the sound gets closer, until it
<b>Floyd</b> | is right next to you, all around you, inside your own head before you
<b>Floyd</b> | are awakened by the alarm clock.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This time, though...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A figure swims out of the darkness, backlit, so that you can only make
<b>Floyd</b> | out a childlike face of tragic innocence and flowing hair.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Who... are you?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There isn't an answer right away--instead, everything around you turns
<b>Floyd</b> | completely white. And somehow... puffy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Do you know WHY you have always hated the sound, Kristen? The child,
<b>Floyd</b> | invisible now, speaks, for the first time; androgynous, cultured. You
<b>Floyd</b> | can't respond. you wish you could. It just sparks something deep
<b>Floyd</b> | within you, something primal--something below reason, below
<b>Floyd</b> | rationality, below everything but fear. You don't like it when your
<b>Floyd</b> | brain keeps secrets from you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I've waited a long time... and still am. Your surroundings flicker
<b>Floyd</b> | between the endless white and writhing black, the two merging into
<b>Floyd</b> | some unwholesome gray. Kristen... your child is waiting.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I don't have a..." The retort died on your lips. The hum of a

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Patently ridiculous. You don't have a child. You never did. How could

<b>Floyd</b> | An Interactive Fiction by Drew and Johnny
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 1 / Serial number 090829 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib
<b>Floyd</b> | 6/12N)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You stand up and stretch, various parts of your body making worrisome
<b>Floyd</b> | popping noises as you exit the car, noting with a vague sense of
<b>Floyd</b> | triumph that it has once again failed to cause your violent death in
<b>Floyd</b> | some spectacular fashion or other. The cold night air is chill against
<b>Floyd</b> | your skin--fortunate, then, that you brought your coat.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Outskirts of Gainesville
<b>Floyd</b> | You stand on the side of the packed dirt road leading to Gainesville.
<b>Floyd</b> | The road stretches far away behind you to the south and, eventually,
<b>Floyd</b> | turns off into a paved one that leads back to the central transit
<b>Floyd</b> | explosion that is modern American transportation. Your vision of the
<b>Floyd</b> | town is obscured by the trees; all you can tell is that the path
<b>Floyd</b> | leads, for now, to the north.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your next-to useless, banged-up car is decidedly parked here. The
<b>Floyd</b> | driver's side door is shut smugly in your face.

<b>Floyd</b> | and the long drive home. When you get inside, past 3:00 in the
<b>Floyd</b> | morning, you don't feel like doing anything but sleeping. So you do,
<b>Floyd</b> | and are haunted by more dreams. Then you wake up, dash the sleep from
<b>Floyd</b> | your brain with Very Black Coffee, and head in to... your job.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Ugh, your job. How you fucking hate your job. You hate it with more
<b>Floyd</b> | passion than you've ever hated anything. It's the most inuring,
<b>Floyd</b> | mind-numbing, idiot-oriented piece of trash that ever earned the title
<b>Floyd</b> | of shit. Every day you see the same people, sell the same things, hear

<b>Floyd</b> | day you see a new, glittering example of idiocy to the millionth
<b>Floyd</b> | power, people so stupid that you wouldn't even hire them to scrub your
<b>Floyd</b> | God damn floors. Fun as that is, you also get to listen to the
<b>Floyd</b> | President's sentient head polyp abusing the airwaves with a three-hour
<b>Floyd</b> | diatribe of bullshit on his favorite topic: how he's right about
<b>Floyd</b> | everything and everyone who disagrees is wrong and stupid and evil and
<b>Floyd</b> | worthless and going down to a ring of fire lower than the one reserved
<b>Floyd</b> | for rich drug-abusing hypocrites.

<b>Floyd</b> | While you try to set the countertop radio on fire with your mind, in
<b>Floyd</b> | troupe the 16 year old girls giggling for their birth control. Out
<b>Floyd</b> | they go to the sleazeballs that brought them there, twice their age,
<b>Floyd</b> | waiting in a convertible that could--should--cost more than their
<b>Floyd</b> | yearly salary. You sell them their precious baby barriers, resisting
<b>Floyd</b> | the urge to jam the register key into your carotid and bleed all over
<b>Floyd</b> | their shiny, shiny shoes. In the midst of your reverie, you can't help
<b>Floyd</b> | but idly reflect that there is something horribly, cruelly ironic
<b>Floyd</b> | about all this. Not just a Conservative talk show host blathering on
<b>Floyd</b> | about the moral decay of America in the 21st century while gleefully
<b>Floyd</b> | assisting in it, not just Rush fat-fucker Limbaugh playing at a drug
<b>Floyd</b> | store. The entire road map of your life, all the experiences and the
<b>Floyd</b> | choices that have brought you to this place and this time, combine
<b>Floyd</b> | into something too much like a giant Carlin routine on the true
<b>Floyd</b> | meaning of irony.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thankfully the day ends and you return home, carotid intact. As you
<b>Floyd</b> | talk to a few of your more distant friends over Yahoo IM, you think
<b>Floyd</b> | about telling them about the little "adventure" you went on the day
<b>Floyd</b> | before; in the end, though, you decide not to. It's so embarrassing,
<b>Floyd</b> | what did you even do it for? There's better ways to change the pace
<b>Floyd</b> | than taking eight-hour drives across the state to God knows where.
<b>Floyd</b> | Best to forget about it, concentrate on what's real.
