						people meet online to cooperatively play
						a game of interactive fiction.

						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>The Colour Pink</em> written by Robert Street.
						It took 6th place in the 11th Annual Interactive Fiction Competition (2005).

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You are on an abandoned planet again. Not content with almost killing
<b>Floyd</b> | you the last time, the Captain has delegated you again to investigate
<b>Floyd</b> | another out-of-contact colony. Apparently you impressed him with your
<b>Floyd</b> | survival instincts, by evading thousands of insect-like creatures
<b>Floyd</b> | before the ship finally sent down enough people to wipe them out.
<b>Floyd</b> | Maybe your job description should just be renamed as the Expendable
<b>Floyd</b> | Explorer. Unfortunately, you have no choice but to obey the Captain's
<b>Floyd</b> | orders.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An hour ago you were sent down into a thick jungle. When you made
<b>Floyd</b> | contact with the ship you found out that they had missed the clearing
<b>Floyd</b> | where you were supposed to land. The intervening hour was spent
<b>Floyd</b> | cutting through the energetic plant-life until you finally reached
<b>Floyd</b> | your destination.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is time to start your investigation. One strange fact that you have
<b>Floyd</b> | already noticed is that there was no sign of any animals in the
<b>Floyd</b> | jungle.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Southeast corner of ruins</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | This clearing used to be the site of a house, where a team of
<b>Floyd</b> | scientists, who were studying the planet, lived. This is no longer the
<b>Floyd</b> | case, as the house has burned down. The fire is probably the reason
<b>Floyd</b> | for the colony being out of contact, but you are not sure it is the
<b>Floyd</b> | whole reason, as something does not feel right here. The ashes from
<b>Floyd</b> | the house cover the ground, along with various twisted metal pieces.
<b>Floyd</b> | Weeds are popping up everywhere, as the jungle reclaims the area. The
<b>Floyd</b> | clearing, and ruins, continues to the north and west.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The diary belonged to one of the scientists, Dr. Mark Simmons. Most of
<b>Floyd</b> | the entries are filled with jargon and scientific data, which may be
<b>Floyd</b> | interesting to people back at the ship, but not to you. However, the
<b>Floyd</b> | last entry, which is dated several weeks ago, is different:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ...I don't know why, but the world has suddenly become crazy.
<b>Floyd</b> | Everything was fine yesterday (apart from my usual complaint that with
<b>Floyd</b> | the increasing periods of absence for James, I have been forced away
<b>Floyd</b> | from my studies too much). However, today everyone and everything
<b>Floyd</b> | seems to have gone insane. At the moment I am hiding in the jungle
<b>Floyd</b> | away from the madness. I think I will go back soon though. No, I
<b>Floyd</b> | won't. Maybe. The only thing stopping me is this writing. I have to
<b>Floyd</b> | keep writing to stop the temptation. The need. No, it is not a need. I
<b>Floyd</b> | am stronger than this. Maybe if I write what I know, then it will
<b>Floyd</b> | satisfy the craving. Maybe I shouldn't though, as I need to forget.
<b>Floyd</b> | No, I can't forget or think of anything else. I need to figure out
<b>Floyd</b> | what is going on.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What I know, my diary, is that it all started this morning. It started
<b>Floyd</b> | with Jane. She has been acting strangely in recent days, almost
<b>Floyd</b> | paranoid whenever anyone approaches her. I have been avoiding the
<b>Floyd</b> | issue, as this is not my specialty. If James had been there, he would
<b>Floyd</b> | have known what to do. He is always good with the psychological
<b>Floyd</b> | aspects. He couldn't have helped this morning. I have never seen
<b>Floyd</b> | anything like it before. Jane was coloured bright pink. Yes, bright
<b>Floyd</b> | pink. Maybe she was infected with some local disease. I don't know. It
<b>Floyd</b> | seems likely though, as I cannot think of any other explanation. She
<b>Floyd</b> | looked strange, but she looked beautiful, irresistible even. She has
<b>Floyd</b> | always been attractive, but even more so today. Right now, I can't
<b>Floyd</b> | explain how this is true. I only know that it is. She seemed in a
<b>Floyd</b> | daze, mumbling something about how the "PSYCHE" was the key. The key
<b>Floyd</b> | to what, I don't know.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What happened next? I was walking over to treat her condition. Yes,
<b>Floyd</b> | treat her condition. That's why, I think. Anyway, one of the junior
<b>Floyd</b> | scientists, Simon, reached her first. He kissed her. He actually
<b>Floyd</b> | kissed her. And she did not just slap and reject him. I don't
<b>Floyd</b> | understand. Why wasn't it me? I saw Simon change before my eyes. There
<b>Floyd</b> | were ripples in the air, almost like the air was as thick as water.
<b>Floyd</b> | But it isn't. But it was. Simon turned pink as well. I saw ecstasy in
<b>Floyd</b> | his eyes. Or was it just a love of life. I don't know. I didn't stay.
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm ashamed to say that I ran. I shouldn't be too ashamed though, as
<b>Floyd</b> | it is the only reason I am here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I admit that I have gone back once. I saw everyone standing in a
<b>Floyd</b> | circle holding hands. They were all pink. All of them except me. And
<b>Floyd</b> | maybe James. I didn't see him there. They then just disappeared. They
<b>Floyd</b> | vanished and I don't know where. I noticed that the house was burning.
<b>Floyd</b> | Someone must have left something on. It was too late. It is still too
<b>Floyd</b> | late. Everyone is gone, and the pinkness has not disappeared. I
<b>Floyd</b> | noticed in the garden that the fruit had gone pink as well. There were
<b>Floyd</b> | pink native flies, which have blighted our crops, but now it did not
<b>Floyd</b> | seem to matter. Animals were moving in from all directions to eat. I
<b>Floyd</b> | feel no better than those animals at the moment.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I can't go back, but I need food. And that food is the only food I
<b>Floyd</b> | know. Maybe it will be all right by now. I hope so. I'll just have a
<b>Floyd</b> | quick look...

<b>Floyd</b> | notes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Reading through the notes, a few comments stick out:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ...She doesn't like me. I don't understand why, but she doesn't like
<b>Floyd</b> | me. That has never happened to me before, and I will not allow it to
<b>Floyd</b> | happen now...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ...I have developed a new project called "Eros". No one else knows
<b>Floyd</b> | about it and I need someplace secret so no one will find out about it
<b>Floyd</b> | in the future. Funding is not an issue, as being the leader of this
<b>Floyd</b> | settlement makes it easy to divert funds. The aim of this project is
<b>Floyd</b> | to shift reality. If Jane will not like me in this reality maybe I can
<b>Floyd</b> | shift us slightly to a reality where she will...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ...With my previous research and a native substance called Kahrz, I
<b>Floyd</b> | have developed the love potion. It has some strange effects that I
<b>Floyd</b> | have discovered by trying it out on myself. The new reality looks
<b>Floyd</b> | strangely pink, but I don't need the new reality to be perfect, I only
<b>Floyd</b> | need it to work. Love does not seem to be the only emotion amplified.
<b>Floyd</b> | The perception of reality changes on any strong emotions. One
<b>Floyd</b> | advantage from having a shifted reality is that it has provided an
<b>Floyd</b> | excellent hiding spot for a laboratory to develop the potion without
<b>Floyd</b> | any distractions...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ...I now have a machine to develop both the potion and the antidote.
<b>Floyd</b> | To generate the antidote I need to firstly add silver, iron, Vitamin
<b>Floyd</b> | X, Vitamin Y, Vitamin Z and Kahrz. The machine will remove any
<b>Floyd</b> | impurities from the mixture. After pressing the pink button again to
<b>Floyd</b> | mix the ingredients I open the machine for a second time with the
<b>Floyd</b> | yellow button and add some gold...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ...The potion is still not perfect, but I am running out of time
<b>Floyd</b> | before I have no more Kahrz. I have decided to start the next stage. I
<b>Floyd</b> | administered the potion to Jane's drink this morning, and took some
<b>Floyd</b> | myself. She has to meet me very soon now, and I will see the results.
<b>Floyd</b> | I will make a new batch of the antidote and administer it after we are
<b>Floyd</b> | finished...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ...I have a problem. I have collected some of the ingredients in my
<b>Floyd</b> | chest, but I cannot complete the recipe. I have been using the vitamin
<b>Floyd</b> | supplements from upstairs for the antidotes, but I just found out that
<b>Floyd</b> | native animals raided our supply last night and ate them all. There
<b>Floyd</b> | won't be any more until the next ship arrives. I guess I am now going
<b>Floyd</b> | to find out what happens when there is long exposure to the potion...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ...Jane is gone who knows where and I've almost left this reality
<b>Floyd</b> | several times. This laboratory is breaking up around me. I think this
<b>Floyd</b> | is the end of my time here. It is too late to get any help. Too
<b>Floyd</b> | late...

<b>Floyd</b> | You are standing at the base of a hill, which you can climb to the

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">The bridge, over the river</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | A river flows from the mountains in the north to a lake in the south.
<b>Floyd</b> | The water is clear and rushes swiftly underneath the wooden bridge
<b>Floyd</b> | that you are standing on. The speed of the water means that without
<b>Floyd</b> | the bridge you would not be able to get across. A path from the
<b>Floyd</b> | northeast to the southwest travels over the bridge. A hill is to the
<b>Floyd</b> | southeast. Next to the bridge on the river's western side, a fruit
<b>Floyd</b> | tree is surrounded by a pile of sharp rocks. There is no fruit left in
<b>Floyd</b> | the tree, but the remains of the past fruit can be found stuck on the
<b>Floyd</b> | rocks.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A small bird lands and attempts to get the fruit, but it is
<b>Floyd</b> | immediately forced into the air by the sharpness of the rocks
<b>Floyd</b> | underneath it. You feel sorry for the bird and think that there is
<b>Floyd</b> | something odd about the situation.

<b>Floyd</b> | The river from the north reaches its final destination in the lake

<b>Floyd</b> | adequately and the river flowing aggressively. The river's speed means
<b>Floyd</b> | that it is impossible for you to swim north. Next to the pump is an

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">The bottom of the lake, southeast corner</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | Whilst swimming around the southeast corner of the lake, the most
<b>Floyd</b> | noticeable object is a sunken rowboat. The reason for the sinking you
<b>Floyd</b> | would guess has something to do with the crack along the boat's
<b>Floyd</b> | bottom, which probably would not have kept out the water very well. It
<b>Floyd</b> | does not look like the boat was well maintained, although being
<b>Floyd</b> | abandoned at the bottom of the lake wouldn't have helped. You can see
<b>Floyd</b> | to the north a steep underwater cliff that almost reaches the surface.
<b>Floyd</b> | The water's shallowness separates the northeast corner from the rest
<b>Floyd</b> | of the lake. There is a tunnel in the cliff that you can swim into to
<b>Floyd</b> | the north. You can also swim through the lake to the west, or back up
<b>Floyd</b> | to the surface.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The dolphin is currently swimming in the area.

<b>Floyd</b> | very nervous, and his fire breathing problems are obviously affecting
<b>Floyd</b> | him. He looks uncomfortable and is regularly shifting around in the
<b>Floyd</b> | bed, almost as if there was something hidden in the small gap between
<b>Floyd</b> | the dragon and the bed. The dragon's wings and tail are tightly curled
<b>Floyd</b> | around him, as he looks to be trying to hide from the world.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Thank you for playing my IF competition entry. I hope you enjoyed it.
<b>Floyd</b> | If you did, then I advise you to try some of my other games, which are
<b>Floyd</b> | listed in the "about" section that can be accessed during the game.
<b>Floyd</b> | There are seven possible endings. The one you received, plus four
<b>Floyd</b> | others, can still be easily reached by typing "undo" and choosing a
<b>Floyd</b> | different option. However, the other two endings can only be reached
<b>Floyd</b> | by acting differently in the fantasy land.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There are two paths in the game; the Path of Daedalus (a great
<b>Floyd</b> | inventor from Greek myth) and the Path of Diomedes (a great warrior
<b>Floyd</b> | from Greek myth). These paths correspond to solving puzzles with
<b>Floyd</b> | inventive/helpful solutions or violent solutions. The game starts on
<b>Floyd</b> | the Path of Daedalus, but it is possible to completely change the
<b>Floyd</b> | nature of everything to the differently themed parallel world of the
<b>Floyd</b> | Path of Diomedes. Each world better suits the respective method of
<b>Floyd</b> | puzzle solving.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The first change to the Path of Diomedes is triggered by the decision
<b>Floyd</b> | to persevere with violent solutions to puzzles, rather than helpful
<b>Floyd</b> | solutions. The game will seek to dissuade you from this course of
<b>Floyd</b> | action, but if you persevere then you will succeed, and receive the
<b>Floyd</b> | consequences. The opposite is true in returning the world to the Path
<b>Floyd</b> | of Daedalus. There are a number of points where you can switch, and
<b>Floyd</b> | depending on which path you reach the end on, there will be
<b>Floyd</b> | differences to some of the possible endings.

<b>Floyd</b> | The planet is clearly not safe to be colonised in the short term, but

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Captain is doubtful about the truthfulness of the documents you

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At least your adventures are forgotten until one day you are called in
<b>Floyd</b> | by your commanding officer. He shows you a report of disappearances on
<b>Floyd</b> | a newly colonised planet, along with your recommendation for the
<b>Floyd</b> | planet. He tells you that he is very disappointed in you, and he
<b>Floyd</b> | cannot support you continuing in your current role. Your exemplary

<b>Floyd</b> | again. You have never been as relieved in your life to be finally free
<b>Floyd</b> | of the nightmare. All you have to do is to report back to the ship and
<b>Floyd</b> | get out of here. As you press the button on the communicator and ask
<b>Floyd</b> | for the Captain, you wonder what you should conclude in your report.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What would you like to say?
<b>Floyd</b> | (1) There is nothing seriously wrong here.
<b>Floyd</b> | (2) There are a few problems, but they should be resolved in a few
<b>Floyd</b> | years.
<b>Floyd</b> | (3) This place is not safe to be colonised.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing when this planet will be
<b>Floyd</b> | safe. You have the bad feeling that the pinkness is going to spread,
<b>Floyd</b> | not disappear. You cannot allow the planet to be colonised in this
<b>Floyd</b> | condition. It needs to be quarantined, so the pinkness does not spread
<b>Floyd</b> | off-planet. Having made this decision, you gather up your evidence,
<b>Floyd</b> | and report back to the ship.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When you talk to the Captain, you tell him about all your adventures.
<b>Floyd</b> | He is skeptical, but he eventually accepts your point of view that the
<b>Floyd</b> | planet is too dangerous to colonise, and he endorses your
<b>Floyd</b> | recommendations. Your stories are put on record with the other
<b>Floyd</b> | evidence. Whilst you may have convinced the Captain, other reviewers
<b>Floyd</b> | of the file feel it is more likely that you hallucinated from a local
<b>Floyd</b> | disease. That disease may make the planet more dangerous, but it may
<b>Floyd</b> | also have left a permanent effect on your health.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In future years, whenever you try for a promotion, you find yourself
<b>Floyd</b> | rebuffed, as you are too risky. You wonder if you made the right
<b>Floyd</b> | decision. You hope you did, as there is no way you can change it now.
