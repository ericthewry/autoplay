The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Toonesia</i>, written by Jacob&nbsp;Weinstein, followed by <I>Tale of the Kissing Bandit</I> by J. Robinson Wheeler.  <i>Toonesia</i> was originally released as part of the 1995 IF Competition, where it took second place; you can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/216"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.  <i>Tale of the Kissing Bandit</i> was originally released as part of Smoochie Comp; it was nominated for--and ultimately won--the 2001 Xyzzy for Best Individual PC; you can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/1183"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.</br>

<b>Floyd</b> | Miss Adams storms up. "Get out of there this minute, Harold. I'm not
