The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is the second of two transcripts of the games in the penultimate not numbered New Year's Speed IF, written by various authors (the first session transcript can be found <A HREF="http://www.allthingsjacq.com/intfic_clubfloyd_20120101.html"><U>here</U></A>).  You can learn more about these games, including how to download them, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/The_penultimate_not_numbered_New_Year%27s_Speed_IF'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br>

<b>Floyd</b> | The figure is indeed Paul. You kneel beside him and gently turn him
<b>Floyd</b> | over. He looks a little worse for wear, but still very much alive. You
<b>Floyd</b> | put a hand on his heart and feel it flutter. Better do some
<b>Floyd</b> | mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, just to be sure. As you come back up,
<b>Floyd</b> | having checked if his tongue is okay in the process, some shadows fall
<b>Floyd</b> | upon you.
<b>Floyd</b> | You look up and see yourself surrounded by a group of well-armed
<b>Floyd</b> | sharkmen. Mensharks? You are aware of neither the scientific
<b>Floyd</b> | possibility of there being a tribe of undiscovered sharkmen, nor the
<b>Floyd</b> | politically correct term for them.
<b>Floyd</b> |  As you  sit there, gaping at them, quite aware you are staring,
<b>Floyd</b> | another person comes from their lines. It's a creature in a robe with
<b>Floyd</b> | tentacles for a face, but her commanding voice is clearly female:
<b>Floyd</b> | "Get the cute one. Kill the other."
<b>Floyd</b> |  Having no illusions about your looks, you get ready to take a few of
<b>Floyd</b> | them with you. So you stand up and read your wit. A group of them, lead
<b>Floyd</b> | by the tentacle-faced lady, leave with an unconscious Paul carried
<b>Floyd</b> | between them.
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a moment of silence, with only the lapping of the  waves as
<b>Floyd</b> | sound. You never knew there could be uncomfortable silence with a bunch
<b>Floyd</b> | of people about to kill you, but there you have it. Finally you realize
<b>Floyd</b> | they're looking behind you, and as you turn, one swipe from the kraken
<b>Floyd</b> | hurls you screaming into the air.

<b>Floyd</b> | And above you towers the huge, monstrous form of the kraken, its red

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then a golden crack opens in reality, right next to the kraken. A

<b>Floyd</b> | kraken turns its massive form around to face this new foe. But it is no
<b>Floyd</b> | foe- the figure has one hand in its pocket. You glimpse a football
<b>Floyd</b> | jersey behind the golden illumination - holy crap, it's Robb Sherwin!
<b>Floyd</b> | He pulls the kraken on one tentacles, and the creature bows down to
<b>Floyd</b> | him. "Hey buddy! I know a place for creatures like you. Come with me
<b>Floyd</b> | and visit my friend Vest, he'll help you." The kraken nods it's head
<b>Floyd</b> | and follows Robb into the golden crack, but not before punching a hole
<b>Floyd</b> | into the wall, followed by a meaningful look towards you.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Robb!" you shout, "how can I ever thank you?" He turns around, and his

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | Written for the 2011 New Year Speed IF (though in far more than the
<b>Floyd</b> | customary two hours). The brief was to include some, none or all, of
<b>Floyd</b> | the following: your mum's shoes, Italians, a tanning bed, a copy of
<b>Floyd</b> | Doom III, the colour chartreuse, Tiny Tim (preferably as a foe), the
<b>Floyd</b> | smell of your evil twin, an e-peen hammer (whatever that may be), and a
<b>Floyd</b> | shirt which says "I killed my father and all I got was this lousy
<b>Floyd</b> | t-shirt". More or less loosely, all of them are in here somewhere.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I spent more time than is customarily required for Speed-IF; I
<b>Floyd</b> | selfishly wanted a chance to play with Platypus, and I hope the result
<b>Floyd</b> | is not too ragged.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For assistance and testing, thanks to Zachary and Benedict. For
<b>Floyd</b> | patience, thanks to Daniel. For the essential software, thanks to
<b>Floyd</b> | Graham Nelson (for Inform 6 and the Designer's Manual, 4th edition,
<b>Floyd</b> | from which I shamelessly borrowed where necessary), Anson Turner, for
<b>Floyd</b> | the Platypus library and Charles Dickens, for "A Christmas Carol" (from

<b>Floyd</b> | and disconcerting events of that wonderfully disconcerting night.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So you glance at the knocker now, and you are shocked to see it, again,

<b>Floyd</b> | My Dear Mr Scrooge,
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As presently drawn, your will leaves your whole estate to your
<b>Floyd</b> | brothers, and their issue. In practical terms, that means to your
<b>Floyd</b> | nephew and (if he still lives) your brother Mordecai.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We understand that you wish to amend the provisions of your will. Mr
<b>Floyd</b> | Robert Cratchit is to become a partner in the firm of Scrooge & Marley,
<b>Floyd</b> | and he is to inherit the partnership absolutely, the rest of your
<b>Floyd</b> | estate passing to your nephew.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We have accordingly prepared a revised will and partnership deed. If
<b>Floyd</b> | you would be good enough to raise the matter with Mr Cratchit, we look
<b>Floyd</b> | forward to seeing you on the twenty-seventh of this month, at our
<b>Floyd</b> | offices, at eleven o'clock in the forenoon, where the documents can be
<b>Floyd</b> | executed.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You put a drop of punch on you finger and hold it through the bars. The

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Bob looks concerned. "Oh my goodness me," he says, "what on earth is
<b>Floyd</b> | Mrs Cratchit going to say. I simply cannot understand it, the poor

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Tim is even more anxious. "Oh Sir!" he says. "Do not drink a drop of

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The whole story comes out then. How Tim met a stranger, who told him

<b>Floyd</b> | The first are no more than ancient daguerrotypes of the Italian town

<b>Floyd</b> | looking women wearing full black dresses and men in a hat. Then, as the
<b>Floyd</b> | pages go by, the pictures become younger and more vivid. Around the
<b>Floyd</b> | middle of the tome, you scout Rudolph Mancini with his family, a shot
<b>Floyd</b> | taken in the Fifties, all lined up like soldiers during the gathering
<b>Floyd</b> | -- he had personal records, somehow. Those go on for a few turnings of
<b>Floyd</b> | the page.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Almost at the end, the photos change abruptly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | These don't belong here. Other families. Some of the pictures are torn,
<b>Floyd</b> | other crippled. One, a shoot from the Eighties, is bloodstained and it
<b>Floyd</b> | catches your attention. It depicts a family you've seen many times,
<b>Floyd</b> | over the years. The Benellis. One branch of the family, the one
<b>Floyd</b> | spreading from Vittorio, the big one. He's brother to Vincente, the one

<b>Floyd</b> | "Because you are, Cesco." The last of the pictures in the album you

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You are still repeating the same thought, over and over, when you run

<b>Floyd</b> | "So, son. You got something to say?" Mancini is teasing at you, the
<b>Floyd</b> | knife back into its cravings. You are about to ask if that will be what
<b>Floyd</b> | he will use to kill you, when a smile widens in your face. The
<b>Floyd</b> | scugnizzi rest speechless.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yes," you say. "I've read a book recently. It was titled 'Silence of
<b>Floyd</b> | the Gods'. Do you know it?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Mancini formal smile disappears.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Talks about these superhumans who go around saving the world, you
<b>Floyd</b> | know. There is a paragraph, in the book, I really loved. It says: 'The
<b>Floyd</b> | Gods are not mute. If you can't hear their voice, it's because they
<b>Floyd</b> | spend a lot of time thinking'. Do you know what this means? It took
<b>Floyd</b> | some time, but in the end I think I got it."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Zachary lifts the wires and sends a glance at Mancini. "Guess he needs
<b>Floyd</b> | one more, whaddaya think, padre?".
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It means," you go on, "that if something has been working for a very
<b>Floyd</b> | long time, it doesn't mean it will work forever. Do you understand?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm not following you," Mancini replies. His voice is stale.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You will, soon enough."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's in that very second that the door is crushed and four men enter
<b>Floyd</b> | the garage. Zach and Tony turn around just in time to see two bullets
<b>Floyd</b> | each piercing their skull. Johnny tries the other side, but to no
<b>Floyd</b> | avail: One hits him in the leg and the next explodes into his chest
<b>Floyd</b> | like a carnival cracker. Mancini turns slowly and gets to face an old
<b>Floyd</b> | man, maybe in his seventies.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You have killed my sons," the old man whispers, and in less than a
<b>Floyd</b> | second you recognize him. He was in the pic you found in the album.
<b>Floyd</b> | He's father to Vincente and Vittorio Benelli, and grandfather to
<b>Floyd</b> | Hellen. He is your grandfather. "I ain't lettin ya kill my grandsons,
<b>Floyd</b> | also."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Behind him, you scout the fragile, yet stubborn form of Hellen. She is
<b>Floyd</b> | smiling, although her smile looks a bit cold. She winks to you, and in
<b>Floyd</b> | that wink you finally read an infinite levity.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Gods have listened, you think, smiling. They have listened and
<b>Floyd</b> | answered.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And -- as you read in that book -- once the Gods have spoken, they have
