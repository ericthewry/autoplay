The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Glowgrass</i>, written by Nate&nbsp;Cull.  <i>Glowgrass</i> was originally released as part of the 1997 IF Competition, where it took third place. It was also a Xyzzy finalist for Best Game and Best Story.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Glowgrass"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

<b>Floyd</b> | The dropship sways dangerously as the pilot trys to correct for

<b>Floyd</b> | risk a glance below - stupid thing to do, really, at this height, even
<b>Floyd</b> | after taking the anti-vertigo treatment - and you're rewarded with a
<b>Floyd</b> | glimpse of the ruins.  Tantalisingly close, almost totally preserved.
<b>Floyd</b> | After all these years, to finally reach an intact Ancient site -
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The line shears in your fingers, and in sudden slow-motion horror you
<b>Floyd</b> | watch the buckle, the support harness, your entire equipment pack come
<b>Floyd</b> | wrenching up and over your arms.  The debris dangles gracefully in
<b>Floyd</b> | midair for the longest moment, then slides away out of reach as
<b>Floyd</b> | gravity takes over.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Your involuntary scream, drowned in the wind, turns to a jerking gasp
<b>Floyd</b> | as you fall through the jungle tree cover, rolling, sliding, and
<b>Floyd</b> | finally landing with a thud on solid ground -
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The ground of the Ancients!

<b>Floyd</b> | An Interactive Short Story

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Courtyard
<b>Floyd</b> | This appears to be some kind of courtyard in the centre of an Ancient
<b>Floyd</b> | dwelling. The building itself swings around to the north and west,
<b>Floyd</b> | terminating in a crumbling retaining wall due south.  A smaller domed
<b>Floyd</b> | construction opens to the northeast, through a wide metal door
<b>Floyd</b> | (closed).  To the east is a flat space that could bear further

<b>Floyd</b> | exploring.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You hear a high-pitched decelerating whine -- a dropship turbine in
<b>Floyd</b> | trouble -- from the northeast, followed by a dull roaring crash.  Just
<b>Floyd</b> | in time, you duck and cover your eyes.  Blue-white light etches across
<b>Floyd</b> | the landscape, then the gravity blast wave hits.  Every molecule in

<b>Floyd</b> | your private universe shudders.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A minute later, you get to your feet, pain gnawing your body.  Scratch
<b>Floyd</b> | one dropship; nobody could have survived that crash.  Scratch your
<b>Floyd</b> | equipment.  Now it's just you, your wits - and the Ancients.  Hope
<b>Floyd</b> | you're as good a xenohistorian as you claimed at the Institute.

<b>Floyd</b> | Because unless you find some kind of way out of here, it could be
<b>Floyd</b> | months before a recovery team locates you.

<b>Floyd</b> | Glowgrass.  One of the earliest successes of Ancient genetic

<b>Floyd</b> | "The idea was floated at a strategy briefing," Erlmann's online avatar

<b>Floyd</b> | I can definitely state that it is an unfeasible option and will not be

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Erlmann's position, while predictable from his stance on human rights,

<b>Floyd</b> | A moment later, the skycar collides with the wall, shearing up and

<b>Floyd</b> | The electrics die; fusion ignitors spark in a final unregulated surge

<b>Floyd</b> | Skycar, in courtyard
<b>Floyd</b> | The interior of the skycar is fairly cramped compared to a modern
<b>Floyd</b> | altiwing or dropship.  There's a control console directly in front of
<b>Floyd</b> | you, and a viewshield through which you can see the courtyard.  The

<b>Floyd</b> | exit hatch to your side is closed; in the rear of the car is an access
<b>Floyd</b> | panel (currently closed).  A green button on the console is glowing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You see a Frisbee Helipta, a white vat, and a magprobe here.
