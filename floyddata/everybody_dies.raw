The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Everybody Dies</i>, written by Jim&nbsp;Munroe.  <i>Everybody Dies</i> was originally released as part of the 2008 IF Competition, where it took third place. You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Everybody_Dies"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

</br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | It's been a couple years since I came out here -- fuck, must have been
<b>Floyd</b> | two years ago, 'cause Ricky left for school that fall. We were
<b>Floyd</b> | celebrating my first Cutters pay cheque with our friend Jack Daniels
<b>Floyd</b> | and we ran into the cart in the dark and we decided to push it over the
<b>Floyd</b> | bridge into the river.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | I was like, it'll be awesome, it'll be my get-out-of-jail free card.
<b>Floyd</b> | Like if it's a great day I can always say I saw one of our carts in the
<b>Floyd</b> | river. My ace in the hole.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Ricky was like, your ass has a hole? Why you telling me that? Faaaaag.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The river's louder than the cars down here, just to the east.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Something causes his eyes to flick down to my waist, and then his smile
