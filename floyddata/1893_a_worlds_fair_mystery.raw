						The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each
						week at a pre-arranged time, a group of
						people meet online to cooperatively play
						a game of interactive fiction.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>1893: A World's Fair Mystery</em> written by Peter Nepstad.
						<i>1893</i> was released in 2002. It was nominated for the Best Game Xyzzy and won the Best Setting Xyzzy that year. It also ranked 34th on the 2011 Interactive Fiction Top 50 of All Time. 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting

					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing this game, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played this game, and think you might like to at some
						point, I do not recommend reading any further. Instead,

<b>Floyd</b> |  The robbery was bold, to say the least.  Eight diamonds, stolen from
<b>Floyd</b> | secure displays in the Kimberly Diamond Mining Company exhibit.  Four
<b>Floyd</b> | of the diamonds were rough and uncut, three beautifully finished.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | last diamond was the prize of the collection:  one of the largest
<b>Floyd</b> | diamonds in the world, presented to Queen Victoria by the company and
<b>Floyd</b> | on loan from her for this special exhibit.  All of them taken at once,
<b>Floyd</b> | quietly, under the noses of four well-trained guards.

<b>Floyd</b> | You knew there was going to be trouble.  The World's Fair was a place
<b>Floyd</b> | for fortunes to be made--legally or illegally, it mattered not to
<b>Floyd</b> | some.  Outside the fairgrounds, jobs were becoming harder to come by,
<b>Floyd</b> | and it was becoming increasingly evident to what lengths some men
<b>Floyd</b> | would go to earn what they considered rightfully theirs.  And so
<b>Floyd</b> | Chicago's grand Exposition has become not only a place of
<b>Floyd</b> | entertainment and education, but of profit, for those who are clever
<b>Floyd</b> | enough to take advantage.  Dreamers and schemers, fools and sharks,
<b>Floyd</b> | simple farmers and cynical cityfolk mingle together on the grounds.
<b>Floyd</b> | The Columbian Guards keep the peace and provide order as best they
<b>Floyd</b> | can, with your old friend, the most competent Carl Masters, in charge.
<b>Floyd</b> | But although he is well equipped to handle the minor crimes, he never
<b>Floyd</b> | had the best head for the more complex and devious.  And so he called
<b>Floyd</b> | you.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Of Delbras, you know very little.  You know, first, that he has

<b>Floyd</b> | Paris, a dispatch had been received describing him as handsome,

<b>Floyd</b> | Standing in a commanding position in the room is a tall,
<b>Floyd</b> | broad-shouldered man wearing a brown overcoat and smoking a thick
<b>Floyd</b> | cigar.  You recognize him instantly-- Carl Masters, one of the most
<b>Floyd</b> | highly regarded detectives in Chicago.  You heard that he had been
<b>Floyd</b> | hired for the Fair, to oversee all the detective work, and to do a
<b>Floyd</b> | little himself, when the case warranted it.  He had his hands full,
<b>Floyd</b> | you knew, and it was at his suggestion that Fair Management contacted
<b>Floyd</b> | your offices.  He sees you as you enter.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, well, well!"  he shouts, smiling.  "It's good to see you made
<b>Floyd</b> | it.  What do you think of this White City of ours?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You are about to respond, but quickly realize your old friend is not
<b>Floyd</b> | interested in wasting time with idle pleasantries just now.  He
<b>Floyd</b> | continues:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "And yet surrounded by beauty such dastardly deeds occur."  He shakes
<b>Floyd</b> | his head. "I don't need to tell you, but I'm very glad you have
<b>Floyd</b> | finally arrived.  We're in the thick of it now.  This diamond
<b>Floyd</b> | heist--I'm counting on you for it.  We have no one to spare.  As for
<b>Floyd</b> | myself, I have a vexing and rather unpleasant affair--you can read
<b>Floyd</b> | today's paper about it if you like; a kidnapping, for ransom, no less;
<b>Floyd</b> | a young, moneyed gent from Boston took a wrong turn late at night.
<b>Floyd</b> | The family wired yesterday--they've been asked for a ransom but they
<b>Floyd</b> | seem unwilling to pay it.  No leads yet."  He takes another puff on
<b>Floyd</b> | his cigar.  "I'm trying to convince the family to come down and have a
<b>Floyd</b> | go at it; we might yet be able to nab the culprits during the
<b>Floyd</b> | exchange.  It's a delicate business."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Masters turns his full attention on you.  "I'm sorry, best forget
<b>Floyd</b> | about my case and concentrate on yours.  Now listen carefully.  Your
<b>Floyd</b> | office is all set up; there's a safe inside in which you can deposit
<b>Floyd</b> | any of the stolen gems you recover.  There's also a bill of draft on
<b>Floyd</b> | the desk, you can use it to withdraw a daily spending allowance from
<b>Floyd</b> | the bank in this building.  Sorry for the trouble, but as I say, we
<b>Floyd</b> | really have no one to spare.  They will write you up new drafts daily,
<b>Floyd</b> | so you can just head over to the bank when it opens first thing each
<b>Floyd</b> | morning to withdraw your stipend."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I'll try to be here, in the office, every morning until around nine.
<b>Floyd</b> | If you like, we can compare notes and discuss the case.  If you have
<b>Floyd</b> | any questions, just ask.  And if you find anything out, tell me as
<b>Floyd</b> | soon as you can.  I've got to leave soon, but..."  He pauses for a
<b>Floyd</b> | moment.  "I almost forgot.  I'm afraid they haven't given you carte
<b>Floyd</b> | blanche.  You're here as a detective in an unofficial capacity.  So
<b>Floyd</b> | don't expect vendors and customers to part the red sea for you.  I've
<b>Floyd</b> | distributed your picture among the guards, they know who you are and
<b>Floyd</b> | should be able to provide assistance.  If they see trouble, they will
<b>Floyd</b> | come get me.  I should be able to take care of any bureaucratic messes
<b>Floyd</b> | you get into, but just be careful."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm sure you'll want to get familiar with the fairgrounds.  They're
<b>Floyd</b> | quite expansive, but essential to know if you want to get any proper
<b>Floyd</b> | detective work done, at least in my experience.  I left a guidebook in
<b>Floyd</b> | your desk.  There's also a tour that leaves at eleven-thirty every day
<b>Floyd</b> | from just outside the east entrance to this building which you may
<b>Floyd</b> | want to take as well."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You shake hands.  "Welcome to Chicago," he says, smiling.

<b>Floyd</b> | I hope you found it an hour well spent.  There is far more to see --
<b>Floyd</b> | the interiors of the buildings we looked upon, for starters.  Then, to
<b>Floyd</b> | the south, past Agriculture, another group of buildings where you can
<b>Floyd</b> | find Ethnographic exhibits, the largest cannon ever made, from the
<b>Floyd</b> | Krupp family business of Germany, and a replica of the convent where
<b>Floyd</b> | Columbus first contemplated taking his historic voyage.  To the north,
<b>Floyd</b> | wonder upon wonder awaits, with grand exposition buildings dedicated
<b>Floyd</b> | to Transportation, Horticulture, Fine Arts, and more.  Far to the
<b>Floyd</b> | north you should find and visit the building erected by your home
<b>Floyd</b> | state.  And to the northwest, be sure to walk the Midway Plaisance,
<b>Floyd</b> | which has not inaptly been called a great kindergarten for grown-up
<b>Floyd</b> | people, and where many side-shows of the Exposition may be seen, some
<b>Floyd</b> | of them more than common excellence, and all of them of refreshing

<b>Floyd</b> | You knew there was going to be trouble.  The World's Fair was a place

<b>Floyd</b> | and it was becoming increasingly evident to what lengths some men
<b>Floyd</b> | would go to earn what they considered rightfully theirs.  And so
<b>Floyd</b> | Chicago's grand Exposition has become not only a place of
<b>Floyd</b> | entertainment and education, but of profit, for those who are clever
<b>Floyd</b> | enough to take advantage.  Dreamers and schemers, fools and sharks,
<b>Floyd</b> | simple farmers and cynical cityfolk mingle together on the grounds.
<b>Floyd</b> | The Columbian Guards keep the peace and provide order as best they
<b>Floyd</b> | can, with your old friend, the most competent Carl Masters, in charge.
<b>Floyd</b> | But although he is well equipped to handle the minor crimes, he never
<b>Floyd</b> | had the best head for the more complex and devious.  And so he called
