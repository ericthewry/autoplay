The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Dual Transform</i>, written by Andrew Plotkin as "Nigel Smith".  <I>Dual Transform</I> was originally released as part of Casual Gameplay Design Competition 7, where it took third place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Dual_Transform'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Time for a fresh start.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You've been slogging towards the goal -- true metasemanticity -- for
<b>Floyd</b> | months. Code-logic sparkles in your dreams and mutters in your ears.
<b>Floyd</b> | You've made great strides of progress, thrown them away, rewritten,
<b>Floyd</b> | rearranged, refactored -- but the contract deadline is crawling down
<b>Floyd</b> | your throat. No escaping that. You've got to pull this project
<b>Floyd</b> | together, and soon.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So forget all of the environment modelling, the texture cores, the
<b>Floyd</b> | interface splicing. You're going to build on basic physical forces.
<b>Floyd</b> | Like heat, light, maybe mass... Make it feel real, in the user's gut.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Dual Transform
<b>Floyd</b> | A Metasemantic Construction by Andrew Plotkin ("Nigel Smith")
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 5 / Serial number 100225 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib
<b>Floyd</b> | 6/12N)
<b>Floyd</b> | (Type "about" for credits and game information.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Workspace
<b>Floyd</b> | Nothing surrounds you. The virtual space is unbounded and absolutely
<b>Floyd</b> | blank. Just the opposite of what you're aiming at, you think wryly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With a mental flick, you call up the archetype of a force. Pressure,
<b>Floyd</b> | you decide. Mathematically simple, but instinctual. The archetype
<b>Floyd</b> | forms before you: a simple equation hanging in the workspace.

</TD><td></td><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | You cup your hand around the equation and compile. It shrinks
<b>Floyd</b> | obligingly into a small icon, which you take.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This is just what you were hoping for -- a simple principle, from
<b>Floyd</b> | which an entire immersive world can grow. Now to drop it in the
<b>Floyd</b> | workspace and see what you get.

<b>Floyd</b> | The game was written for the Seventh Casual Gameplay Design

<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks to the beta-testers: Marius M?ller, Zhou Fang, Kevin

<b>Floyd</b> | This is your workspace. All your furniture and things are set up just
<b>Floyd</b> | as you like them. The exit is to the south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The cube representing your workspace sits on a desk. Inside it, the
<b>Floyd</b> | seven icons vibrate wildly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You look around. This, too, is magnificent -- in a quiet way. The
<b>Floyd</b> | program has condensed your style of interaction into a tangible
<b>Floyd</b> | metaphor... a perfect rendition of the way you work.
