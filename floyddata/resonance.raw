					<span class="fontish smaller">The idea behind ClubFloyd
						is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of 
						people meet online to cooperatively play a game of 
						interactive fiction.<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Resonance</em> written by Nereida Scales, 
						
						and <em>Compliance</em> written by Christopher Conley.
						The introductions to <I>Resonance</I> and <I>Compliance</I> were both entered in the 2012 IntroComp, where they took first and second place, respectively.  This transcript covers the awards ceremony, with playthroughs of these two entries directly following. 
						
						You can learn more about the games, including how to download them, by visiting
						
						
							
								the ifWiki pages: 
								<a class="decorate" href="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Compliance">Compliance</a>, and <a class="decorate" href="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Resonance_(Nereida_Scales_game)">Resonance</a>.

					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing these games, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played these games, and think you might like to at some
						point, I do not recommend reading any further. Instead,
						you might want to return to the <a class="decorate" href=

<b>Floyd</b> | As with other Reavers, you've heard stories that he is a terror on the

<b>Floyd</b> | New Reaver? You?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Reavers of the Monaire Empire were among the most influential and
<b>Floyd</b> | respected people in the continent, and Reaver Harking thought to make
<b>Floyd</b> | you one of them, an equal to himself?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You begin to speak, but fall silent when you notice the Emperor's eyes
<b>Floyd</b> | on you. Though you had thought him to look completely normal before,
<b>Floyd</b> | his current expression seems utterly cold and emotionless. It's
<b>Floyd</b> | impossible to tell if he's disappointed, curious, amused, or just
<b>Floyd</b> | doesn't care.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Objections?" the Emperor asks, shifting his focus to the man to your
<b>Floyd</b> | right.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Nope," the armored man replies, holding a steady grin.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Then I believe we have a new Reaver," the Emperor calmly declares.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With those words, the newest chapter in the story of your life begins.

<b>Floyd</b> | It has a somewhat satisfying ring to it as you say your new title in

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Yet... You can't help but feel completely out of place.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Aside from the borderline hostile reactions you receive when people
<b>Floyd</b> | figure out that you're a "godless Asylian", you have no skills that are
<b>Floyd</b> | of any real use to the Empire.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sure, back home, your talent in painting had earned you the greatest
<b>Floyd</b> | honor and title in Asylia. With your culture gone however, that title
<b>Floyd</b> | was little more than a meaningless bit of sentimentality.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Reaver Harking had placed you in an out of the way place as a guard for
<b>Floyd</b> | a time, but you were probably the worst guard the Empire had ever been
<b>Floyd</b> | unfortunate enough to have.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | No matter how you thought about it, to the Empire, a painter is
<b>Floyd</b> | completely useless. The fact that Reaver Harking found you important
<b>Floyd</b> | enough to not only save from certain death, but to make his Second was
<b>Floyd</b> | definitely... odd.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now, here you are in one of the highest positions of authority in the
<b>Floyd</b> | Empire. The previous Reavers were all legends, terrifying and awesome
<b>Floyd</b> | in their abilities. They were the type of people who you followed,
<b>Floyd</b> | unquestioningly, knowing they were capable of utterly destroying your

<b>Floyd</b> | And here you are, Reaver Golly, expected to rank among these terrible

<b>Floyd</b> | A: It'll take a lot of hard work, but I'll make it my goal to live up

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "What happened to Reaver Triolo?" you question.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Dunno," Syphel casually shrugs.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Reaver Triolo was famous for being the greatest swordsman of the era.
<b>Floyd</b> | He was also known for being ruthless and excessively cruel, usually
<b>Floyd</b> | choosing to be at the front of a battle rather than direct it from the
<b>Floyd</b> | sidelines. The fact that he chose to wear the most intimidating set of
<b>Floyd</b> | armor he could find certainly didn't help soften his image.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You had previously worked in his section of the Imperial Combat Forces,
<b>Floyd</b> | and the few times you'd ever seen him he was either insulting you or
<b>Floyd</b> | one of your fellow guardsmen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The other Reaver you'd met was a Sage of some importance, although you

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | That was the name. "Yes. What happened to her?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Don't care. Look, I wouldn't worry about it. Triolo and Plorina
<b>Floyd</b> | weren't the best people in the world, and hopefully they got what they
<b>Floyd</b> | deserved."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You blink, unable to respond to his sudden harshness. Reaver Triolo was
<b>Floyd</b> | admittedly a horrible and brutal man. The one time you had met Reaver

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Aside from Reaver Harking offering you the chance to change rooms this

<b>Floyd</b> | never allowed you to go anywhere without an escort of guards. Whether

<b>Floyd</b> | never sure of.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In addition to the lack of escort, the fact that you didn't have to

<b>Floyd</b> | without the carriage, the trip would have taken too long. As it stands,
<b>Floyd</b> | he seems fairly restless most of the time.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You've managed a few interesting conversations out of him so far. He's
<b>Floyd</b> | explained that each of the Reavers were responsible for one third of
<b>Floyd</b> | the expansion progress of the Empire. Reaver Harking handles things in
<b>Floyd</b> | the west, though you were vaguely aware of this before. Syphel took

<b>Floyd</b> | refuses to comment on the former Reaver other than to express his

<b>Floyd</b> | You, apparently, will be expected to take over Reaver Triolo's
