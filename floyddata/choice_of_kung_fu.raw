					<p class="leftalign">
					<span class="fontish smaller">The idea behind ClubFloyd
						is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of 
						people meet online to cooperatively play a game of 
						interactive fiction.<br>

						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Choice of Kung Fu</em> written by Alana Joli Abbott.
						<I>Choice of Kung Fu</I> is an independent ChoiceScript which was released in 2012.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The noise of battle is distracting, and it takes you almost too long to
<b>Floyd</b> | realize that the warning was shouted to you. An outlaw wearing a blue
<b>Floyd</b> | turban is charging toward you, his longspear leveled at your heart.
<b>Floyd</b> | What will you do?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: Stand firm, blocking the spear away at the last moment and slashing
<b>Floyd</b> | twin tiger claws across his face.
<b>Floyd</b> | B: Pounce toward him at the last moment, springing like a leopard, and
<b>Floyd</b> | bring an elbow down on his head.
<b>Floyd</b> | C: Dart off to the side, balancing on one leg like a crane before
<b>Floyd</b> | delivering a swift kick to his knee.
<b>Floyd</b> | D: Weave hypnotically in my stance, and when he strikes, I am no longer
<b>Floyd</b> | there; I launch a series of quick, snakelike strikes to the pressure
<b>Floyd</b> | points in his exposed rib cage.
<b>Floyd</b> | E: Make a series of flashy moves that draw his target toward my right
<b>Floyd</b> | side, then move to the left, delivering a reiken strike to the right
<b>Floyd</b> | side of his head as he passes by.
<b>Floyd</b> | F: Remain still, my hands low at the chi center of my body, and at the
<b>Floyd</b> | moment he would hit me, circle his spear away and shift myself away
<b>Floyd</b> | from the strike.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | &gt; He stumbles when his attack falters, and he clutches one arm to his
<b>Floyd</b> | injured side. He looks suddently exhausted, courtesy of the disruption
<b>Floyd</b> | in his chi that your knowledge of the mystical Snake technique allowed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With your opponent deterred, but not out of the fight, how do you
<b>Floyd</b> | follow up your attack?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: Use a palm heel strike under the chin to drive his head backwards,
<b>Floyd</b> | tearing down with a tiger claw on his face as he falls.
<b>Floyd</b> | B: Drive into him with a series of fast leopard punches down the center
<b>Floyd</b> | of his body until he falls to the ground.
<b>Floyd</b> | C: Take his leg out from under him with a sweeping straight kick,
<b>Floyd</b> | delivering a wing strike to his neck at the same moment, graceful as a
<b>Floyd</b> | crane.
<b>Floyd</b> | D: With my fingers tight like a snake's head, strike out at his face
<b>Floyd</b> | and neck in a complex pattern of several hits that impact on nerve
<b>Floyd</b> | points, disabling him.
<b>Floyd</b> | E: Feign a low kick to the knee, and when he moves the spear shaft down
<b>Floyd</b> | to block, shoot a dragon tooth strike?my fingers separated in a V?into
<b>Floyd</b> | his eyes before sweeping him from behind.
<b>Floyd</b> | F: His death would be senseless and against the Buddha nature; pivot
<b>Floyd</b> | around behind him and lock him in a sleeper hold.

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | &gt; The quick strikes of the Snake style, combined with the knowledge of
<b>Floyd</b> | chi, drop him to the ground, unconscious. He'll be feeling that when he
<b>Floyd</b> | wakes up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The outlaws continue toward you and your fellow students, flashes of
<b>Floyd</b> | blue catching your eye against the greens and browns of the marsh
<b>Floyd</b> | surrounding your path. It is hard to imagine that only moments ago, the
<b>Floyd</b> | nine of you were making your way back to the monastery of the Order of
<b>Floyd</b> | the Peach Tree, students on the simple assignment of escorting a
<b>Floyd</b> | wagonload of supplies home.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The students have mostly remained on the path, where their footing is
<b>Floyd</b> | more certain, but the outlaws appear to have little trouble navigating
<b>Floyd</b> | the wetlands. While they fight like untrained peasants, numbers are
<b>Floyd</b> | definitely on their side.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's time to get serious. Drawing on the training you received before
<b>Floyd</b> | entering the Order of the Peach Tree, you prepare your next attack. How
<b>Floyd</b> | will you fight?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: Draw my sword. This blade was forged by the most expert smiths in
<b>Floyd</b> | the Middle Kingdom, designed specifically to be used with the Celestial
<b>Floyd</b> | Sword style, taught only to the Imperial Family.
<b>Floyd</b> | B: Unhitch the horse from the cart of supplies. He is a mean beast?not
<b>Floyd</b> | the fine mare I trained on at my father's estate?but few monks could
<b>Floyd</b> | master a horse from as honorable a family as mine. I draw my blade and
<b>Floyd</b> | prepare to charge.
<b>Floyd</b> | C: Draw on my chi, as well the energy in the world around me. I can
<b>Floyd</b> | sense the life energies of my fellow students and the approaching
<b>Floyd</b> | outlaws.
<b>Floyd</b> | D: Release the bindings that secure my longspear to my back. It is only
<b>Floyd</b> | one of the many weapons I have mastered in my wanderings, and it is a
<b>Floyd</b> | good choice to keep the outlaws at bay.
<b>Floyd</b> | E: Why change? The style my masters at the Order of the Peach Tree are
<b>Floyd</b> | teaching me is a superior one, and I am eager to prove the worth of my
<b>Floyd</b> | unarmed style in battle.

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | &gt; Even your fellow students are wary of the Xian style, which utilizes
<b>Floyd</b> | what the uninformed consider "magic." But you know to be your power to
<b>Floyd</b> | be from the energies of the universe, which are at your beck and call.
<b>Floyd</b> | You also know that the perception of your abilities can be used against
<b>Floyd</b> | your enemies?and one day, you hope it will inspire your allies. For
<b>Floyd</b> | now, the other students shy away from you, except for Lu Jin, your
<b>Floyd</b> | primary rival for the place of senior student, who watches you with a
<b>Floyd</b> | wary eye.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The battle that follows is hectic; the outlaws have little in the way
<b>Floyd</b> | of skill, but they make up for it in passion. They are determined to
<b>Floyd</b> | have your supplies, despite the clear skill shown by you and your
<b>Floyd</b> | fellow students. Though you are focused on keeping them from trying to
<b>Floyd</b> | kill you, you notice as you disable your opponents that they are
<b>Floyd</b> | skinny, likely the result of being poorly fed. You also note that a
<b>Floyd</b> | number of the outlaws are women.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Does that surprise you?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: Yes. Fighting is the realm of warriors, and the role of the warrior
<b>Floyd</b> | falls to the men.
<b>Floyd</b> | B: No. Outlaws have always bucked convention; why bother following
<b>Floyd</b> | social rules?
<b>Floyd</b> | C: Yes, but it is nice to know that I am not alone in questioning
<b>Floyd</b> | traditional roles.
<b>Floyd</b> | D: No. I am used to fighting side by side among men and women
<b>Floyd</b> | accomplished in the way of battle.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Governor Rong is disinclined to ask the Emperor to help combat the

<b>Floyd</b> | while studying at the Order of the Peach Tree. But though there are
<b>Floyd</b> | many images to contemplate, most of the scroll is empty. There do not
<b>Floyd</b> | seem to be any great secrets contained in the writing here. You do not

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | There are actually fewer details than you would have expected for this
<b>Floyd</b> | mission. Neither Abbot Bao nor Master Shen knows how many bandits are
<b>Floyd</b> | present near Kuei Xian. They do know that the center of activity seems
<b>Floyd</b> | to be at Baijiang Bridge, an old stone bridge that remains from the
<b>Floyd</b> | years of the Sun Dynasty, when an army marched across it five horses at
<b>Floyd</b> | a time, or so legends say. Kuei Xian, which sits in the shadow of a
<b>Floyd</b> | huge, turtlelike karst hill in the foothills of the Yellow Mountains,
<b>Floyd</b> | is a small village, but with important enough history?and pleasant
<b>Floyd</b> | enough weather?that the governor of the province keeps his summer home
<b>Floyd</b> | there.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Governor Rong is disinclined to ask the Emperor to help combat the
<b>Floyd</b> | problem directly. (You gather from Master Shen's muttered commentary
<b>Floyd</b> | that this would make it look as though he cannot solve the problems of
<b>Floyd</b> | his own district.) Instead, he has asked the Order of the Peach Tree
<b>Floyd</b> | for aid, and given the importance of the trade that flows across the
<b>Floyd</b> | Baijiang Bridge, and the order's dedication as protectors of the people
<b>Floyd</b> | of the Middle Kingdom, the abbot has agreed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Of course, should you and Lu Jin fail to quell the problem, more
<b>Floyd</b> | important resources than students will have to be expended, either by
<b>Floyd</b> | the Order or by the Emperor. This would bring dishonor to everyone:
<b>Floyd</b> | you, the order, Governor Rong, and possibly the Emperor himself in the
<b>Floyd</b> | face of the foreigners at his court.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Abbot Bao tells you the names of the students he expects to accompany
<b>Floyd</b> | you. Several of them were present when the bandits attacked. You are to
<b>Floyd</b> | ready your equipment and leave in the morning.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: I seek out Lu Jin to discuss this mission.

<b>Floyd</b> | immortality, though whether this was through alchemy, devout living, or
<b>Floyd</b> | the mystical arts of the bedchamber is the subject of much debate. No

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Zhuge lives in the mountains above Kuei Xian," Master Shen continues.
<b>Floyd</b> | He pulls a scroll out of his sengfu and hands it to you. It is a map of
<b>Floyd</b> | that section of the Yellow Mountains, incredibly detailed. A hermitage
<b>Floyd</b> | is marked.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Master Shen stands, slowly, hiding the quick reactions you know he is
<b>Floyd</b> | capable of. "I suggest you take a present," he says, and knocks the
<b>Floyd</b> | bough of the peach tree with his staff again. A pile of peaches falls
<b>Floyd</b> | into your lap. "Go. Learn. I will see you in a few years, if I am still

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What gift will you take with you?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: Peaches. If Master Shen suggested them, they must be a good idea.

<b>Floyd</b> | stories as a child, and you have studied the different tellings of that
<b>Floyd</b> | event at every opportunity. Master Zhuge was on the side of Hong Wei,
<b>Floyd</b> | the most capable general among the three armies, who fought on behalf
<b>Floyd</b> | of the Imperial Family against a rebelling warlord and the horse-riding
<b>Floyd</b> | savages of the western plains. Between General Hong and Master Zhuge,
<b>Floyd</b> | the battle was decisive, and Hongcao Pass was named after the general,
<b>Floyd</b> | who became a trusted advisor to the Emperor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The story that Master Zhuge tells you surprises you: Zhuge knew that in
<b>Floyd</b> | order for the general's strategy to work, the army would need to double
<b>Floyd</b> | the number of drummers sending out the orders to the soldiers. In order
<b>Floyd</b> | to meet the army's need, Zhuge recruited a number of young women
<b>Floyd</b> | instrumentalists from a nearby village. Though General Hong was unsure
<b>Floyd</b> | about using untried women in the role, they were vital to his ruse: he
<b>Floyd</b> | needed the drum calls to disorient his enemies and keep the opposing
<b>Floyd</b> | armies from learning his location until it was too late for them to
<b>Floyd</b> | prevent his attack. Zhuge snuck the women up into the pass into secure
<b>Floyd</b> | locations, where their drum calls would echo and multiply, thus adding
<b>Floyd</b> | further confusion to General Hong's original plan. Many other details
<b>Floyd</b> | played into the battle, of course?including an east wind Master Zhuge

<b>Floyd</b> | strategic decisions.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Do you question her technique?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: The distraction is unwelcome. I would rather pore over maps of

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | &gt; Paying attention to both the stories and the strategy of the game,
<b>Floyd</b> | retaining both in your head without being distracted, is certainly a
<b>Floyd</b> | skill that requires a quick mind. It also has the added benefit of
<b>Floyd</b> | causing you to focus more closely on Master Zhuge's reactions and
<b>Floyd</b> | expressions. You feel you are beginning to learn how to read her
<b>Floyd</b> | emotions more clearly, and your insight into her expressions aids both
<b>Floyd</b> | your game and your understanding of her campaign decisions. One
<b>Floyd</b> | evening, during which you are comparing two accounts of the campaign
<b>Floyd</b> | during the Border War fought between Emperor Da Xiaoten?the grandfather
<b>Floyd</b> | of current Emperor Da Gaozu, the Son of Heaven?and the barbarians of
<b>Floyd</b> | the western plains, Master Zhuge sets up the go board, as has become
<b>Floyd</b> | your custom. This time, however, she sets three chairs around the
<b>Floyd</b> | table.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Are we having company?" you ask.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "In a manner of speaking," Master Zhuge says in her typical cryptic
<b>Floyd</b> | fashion.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After arranging the board, Master Zhuge disappears into her room, then
<b>Floyd</b> | returns with a silk bag and heads outside. You follow, curious, and
<b>Floyd</b> | watch as she withdraws a bundle of small flags and arranges them in a
<b>Floyd</b> | circle. She begins to chant in a language that is only vaguely
<b>Floyd</b> | familiar?it sounds like a very old dialect of your own language, with a
<b>Floyd</b> | very different vocabulary?and, after a few moments, the ghost appears.
<b>Floyd</b> | At first he is only a shade, but as Master Zhuge's chanting continues,
<b>Floyd</b> | he resolves into a tall man wearing scale armor over a changshan. A red
<b>Floyd</b> | cloak is draped over his armor, and his helmet is decorated with an
<b>Floyd</b> | equally red feather plume. A well-shaped beard and mustache, flecked
<b>Floyd</b> | with gray, surround a mouth that breaks into a smile when he sees your
<b>Floyd</b> | master.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Zhuge Miao," he says, sounding like an echo of a once-booming voice.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Has it been long, my friend?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ages," Master Zhuge confirms, taking the ghost's hands in her own. "I
<b>Floyd</b> | have a go player to introduce you to while I tell you stories of the
<b>Floyd</b> | future."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The man looks at you sharply.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: I bow, in deference to this old friend of my master's.
<b>Floyd</b> | B: I bow, but only slightly. Surely I have greater status than a ghost!
<b>Floyd</b> | C: I remain frozen in place, unsure how to greet a ghost.
<b>Floyd</b> | D: I bow, recognizing General Hong Wei from his description in the
<b>Floyd</b> | legends.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A contest like this one requires witnesses, and you have requested the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What terms have you decided on?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: We will fight to unconsciousness or disabling; I am prepared to sign
<b>Floyd</b> | a death waiver.
<b>Floyd</b> | B: We will fight to surrender, but no death waivers will be required.
<b>Floyd</b> | C: We will fight using the point system devised by the Imperial

<b>Floyd</b> | When you arrive at the monastery, you explain to Abbot Bao what has

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "To Zhuge Meili:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Based on the reputation of your skill and honor, you have been
<b>Floyd</b> | selected to compete in a fighting exhibition for the entertainment of
<b>Floyd</b> | the glorious Emperor. The fight, which will take place in an arena now
<b>Floyd</b> | being constructed just south of the Imperial capital, will feature two
<b>Floyd</b> | warriors of my native country on horseback, wielding the weapons of our
<b>Floyd</b> | lands. You will fight alongside a captured rebel and traitor to the
<b>Floyd</b> | Middle Kingdom, Lu Jin, who will be released from the Imperial dungeons
<b>Floyd</b> | for the event. The outcome of the combat will settle a wager between
<b>Floyd</b> | myself and the Emperor as to which nation boasts superior fighters.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "As a reward, the winners will be granted lands and a title by the
<b>Floyd</b> | crown, and, should it be relevant, receive a pardon for crimes against
<b>Floyd</b> | the Empire. More, however, the winners will have the prestige of having
<b>Floyd</b> | defended their country's honor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "An Imperial guard will be sent to accompany you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Cheers,
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "George Gower"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It looks as though you will be unable to simply decline participating
<b>Floyd</b> | in this competition. How do you react to this summons?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: Lu Jin, a prisoner? Of course we will fight?and win?to insure his
<b>Floyd</b> | freedom!
<b>Floyd</b> | B: This is our moment to prove the foreigners are unworthy. We will
<b>Floyd</b> | fight for the honor of the Middle Kingdom!
<b>Floyd</b> | C: This is sure to be a farce, with the game board aligned against us,
<b>Floyd</b> | but we will triumph regardless?by whatever means necessary.

<b>Floyd</b> | between you and the capital, the walled city stretches out in front of
<b>Floyd</b> | you, fading into mist, so that it appears that the city itself extends
<b>Floyd</b> | forever. A river runs through the center of the city, and one wall of
<b>Floyd</b> | the palace rubs against it like a cat against a friendly hand. The
<b>Floyd</b> | palace itself towers above the rest of the city, its golden calligraphy
<b>Floyd</b> | catching stray bits of light that float in through the mist, making it
<b>Floyd</b> | seem as though the whole building sparkles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Xiaonanhai is the center of the Middle Kingdom, its heart and its
<b>Floyd</b> | breath. It is a testament to the working of humans, and proof that
<b>Floyd</b> | human hands can create something lasting. It also buzzes like a hive of
<b>Floyd</b> | angry bees; anyone within its walls must be wary that they are not
<b>Floyd</b> | stung by criminals and bureaucrats alike.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The soldiers are eager to get you to the palace, given that you have
<b>Floyd</b> | arrived the day before the competition, but you persuade them to stop
<b>Floyd</b> | by Tai Thong, a pastry shop you remember fondly from the last time you
<b>Floyd</b> | were in Xiaonanhai. The proprietors treat all their customers like

<b>Floyd</b> | released into the custody of the Imperial soldiers as soon as you

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Instead, however, you are escorted to a guest room in the palace,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You agree to listen to Lu Jin's suggestions, though as he has been
<b>Floyd</b> | incarcerated for months, it appears, you wonder how he could have
<b>Floyd</b> | anything useful to add. As you sit together, Lu Jin gives you all the
<b>Floyd</b> | information about the competition he has been able to glean. The two
<b>Floyd</b> | foreign competitors are masters of an old sport combat style called
<b>Floyd</b> | jousting that is rarely practiced in Gower's home country except for
<b>Floyd</b> | entertainment. They will be wearing thick plates of armor and carrying
<b>Floyd</b> | shields, using long lances to try to unhorse or kill you in a direct
<b>Floyd</b> | charge. You will be provided with ji, spear-tipped halberds that have
<b>Floyd</b> | crescent blades around a sword-breaker on either side of the haft.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Their armor is an advantage on horseback, but we'll move much faster
<b>Floyd</b> | than they will on the ground," Lu Jin theorizes. "And they'll have
<b>Floyd</b> | limited visibility due to their helmets?we should be able to stay in
<b>Floyd</b> | their blind spots, again if we can bring them to the ground. The hard
<b>Floyd</b> | part about the armor is that it offers very few openings: their eyes
<b>Floyd</b> | and at the softer armor covering their joints?which is still heavy
<b>Floyd</b> | enough to deflect a blade."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your brain begins working around these issues. "We'll need to figure
<b>Floyd</b> | out their other disadvantages," you say, almost to yourself.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Or you could ask for help," says a familiar voice. The only remaining
<b>Floyd</b> | palace servant steps forward, and you instantly recognize Feng, despite
<b>Floyd</b> | the fox spirit's new disguise. Lu Jin looks at you in confusion, but
<b>Floyd</b> | you just nod for him to listen. "I can offer you these," Feng says,
<b>Floyd</b> | rolling two small vials out onto the palm of her hand. "Poison enough
<b>Floyd</b> | to coat one blade each."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lu Jin begins to reach for the poison.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: Feng has never led me astray before. This is a clever plan, even if
<b>Floyd</b> | it is dishonorable, and I am confident we can execute it without
<b>Floyd</b> | notice.
<b>Floyd</b> | B: Feng is a fox spirit?my companion or not, tempting monks into
<b>Floyd</b> | dishonor is in her nature. No good will come of taking up her offer.
<b>Floyd</b> | C: If we were caught using poison, we would be shown as dishonorable
<b>Floyd</b> | opponents. We cannot risk that loss of face, so we cannot accept the
<b>Floyd</b> | poison.

<b>Floyd</b> | mission. Neither Abbot Bao nor Master Shen knows how many bandits are
<b>Floyd</b> | present near Kuei Xian. They do know that the center of activity seems
<b>Floyd</b> | to be at Baijiang Bridge, an old stone bridge that remains from the
<b>Floyd</b> | years of the Sun Dynasty, when an army marched across it five horses at
<b>Floyd</b> | a time, or so legends say. Kuei Xian, which sits in the shadow of a
<b>Floyd</b> | huge, turtlelike karst hill in the foothills of the Yellow Mountains,
<b>Floyd</b> | is a small village, but with important enough history?and pleasant
<b>Floyd</b> | enough weather?that the governor of the province keeps his summer home
<b>Floyd</b> | there.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Governor Rong is disinclined to ask the Emperor to help combat the
<b>Floyd</b> | problem directly. (You gather from Master Shen's muttered commentary
<b>Floyd</b> | that this would make it look as though he cannot solve the problems of
<b>Floyd</b> | his own district.) Instead, he has asked the Order of the Peach Tree
<b>Floyd</b> | for aid, and given the importance of the trade that flows across the
<b>Floyd</b> | Baijiang Bridge, and the order's dedication as protectors of the people
<b>Floyd</b> | of the Middle Kingdom, the abbot has agreed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Of course, should you and Lu Jin fail to quell the problem, more
<b>Floyd</b> | important resources than students will have to be expended, either by
<b>Floyd</b> | the Order or by the Emperor. This would bring dishonor to everyone:
<b>Floyd</b> | you, the order, Governor Rong, and possibly the Emperor himself in the
<b>Floyd</b> | face of the foreigners at his court.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Abbot Bao tells you the names of the students he expects to accompany
<b>Floyd</b> | you. Several of them were present when the bandits attacked. You are to
<b>Floyd</b> | ready your equipment and leave in the morning.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: I seek out Lu Jin to discuss this mission.

<b>Floyd</b> | back of his leg, collapsing it under him, as you move away from the
<b>Floyd</b> | center of the room and through the crowd of opponents.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The monks realize your strategy quickly, so you have to keep shifting

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | practicing calligraphy and meditating in a clearing near the hut.
<b>Floyd</b> | Neither of these things feels much like poetry when you begin.

<b>Floyd</b> | A: I do not understand Master Zhuge's techniques and have taken to

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | &gt; You know the history of Hongcao Pass?it was one of your favorite
<b>Floyd</b> | stories as a child, and you have studied the different tellings of that
<b>Floyd</b> | event at every opportunity. Master Zhuge was on the side of Hong Wei,
<b>Floyd</b> | the most capable general among the three armies, who fought on behalf
<b>Floyd</b> | of the Imperial Family against a rebelling warlord and the horse-riding
<b>Floyd</b> | savages of the western plains. Between General Hong and Master Zhuge,
<b>Floyd</b> | the battle was decisive, and Hongcao Pass was named after the general,
<b>Floyd</b> | who became a trusted advisor to the Emperor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The story that Master Zhuge tells you surprises you: Zhuge knew that in
<b>Floyd</b> | order for the general's strategy to work, the army would need to double
<b>Floyd</b> | the number of drummers sending out the orders to the soldiers. In order
<b>Floyd</b> | to meet the army's need, Zhuge recruited a number of young women
<b>Floyd</b> | instrumentalists from a nearby village. Though General Hong was unsure
<b>Floyd</b> | about using untried women in the role, they were vital to his ruse: he
<b>Floyd</b> | needed the drum calls to disorient his enemies and keep the opposing
<b>Floyd</b> | armies from learning his location until it was too late for them to
<b>Floyd</b> | prevent his attack. Zhuge snuck the women up into the pass into secure
<b>Floyd</b> | locations, where their drum calls would echo and multiply, thus adding
<b>Floyd</b> | further confusion to General Hong's original plan. Many other details
<b>Floyd</b> | played into the battle, of course?including an east wind Master Zhuge
<b>Floyd</b> | summoned, which caused the banners of the horse barbarians to flutter
<b>Floyd</b> | chaotically in the winding pass and further disorient the enemy?but
<b>Floyd</b> | history's record of the numbers is entirely accurate.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you discuss old battles, day after day, Master Zhuge insists that
<b>Floyd</b> | you play go. The board game, played on a grid where stones of opposing
<b>Floyd</b> | colors?black and white?are used to attempt to surround their opponent's
<b>Floyd</b> | pieces, distracts you from the tales of Master Zhuge's important
<b>Floyd</b> | strategic decisions.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Do you question her technique?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: The distraction is unwelcome. I would rather pore over maps of
<b>Floyd</b> | Master Zhuge's campaigns.
<b>Floyd</b> | B: The multitasking is difficult, but I suspect it is part of the
<b>Floyd</b> | exercise.
<b>Floyd</b> | C: I love go! I could play this game all day.

<b>Floyd</b> | retaining both in your head without being distracted, is certainly a
<b>Floyd</b> | skill that requires a quick mind. It also has the added benefit of
<b>Floyd</b> | causing you to focus more closely on Master Zhuge's reactions and
<b>Floyd</b> | expressions. You feel you are beginning to learn how to read her
<b>Floyd</b> | emotions more clearly, and your insight into her expressions aids both
<b>Floyd</b> | your game and your understanding of her campaign decisions. One
<b>Floyd</b> | evening, during which you are comparing two accounts of the campaign
<b>Floyd</b> | during the Border War fought between Emperor Da Xiaoten?the grandfather
<b>Floyd</b> | of current Emperor Da Gaozu, the Son of Heaven?and the barbarians of
<b>Floyd</b> | the western plains, Master Zhuge sets up the go board, as has become
<b>Floyd</b> | your custom. This time, however, she sets three chairs around the
<b>Floyd</b> | table.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Are we having company?" you ask.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "In a manner of speaking," Master Zhuge says in her typical cryptic
<b>Floyd</b> | fashion.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After arranging the board, Master Zhuge disappears into her room, then
<b>Floyd</b> | returns with a silk bag and heads outside. You follow, curious, and
<b>Floyd</b> | watch as she withdraws a bundle of small flags and arranges them in a
<b>Floyd</b> | circle. She begins to chant in a language that is only vaguely
<b>Floyd</b> | familiar?it sounds like a very old dialect of your own language, with a
<b>Floyd</b> | very different vocabulary?and, after a few moments, the ghost appears.
<b>Floyd</b> | At first he is only a shade, but as Master Zhuge's chanting continues,
<b>Floyd</b> | he resolves into a tall man wearing scale armor over a changshan. A red
<b>Floyd</b> | cloak is draped over his armor, and his helmet is decorated with an
<b>Floyd</b> | equally red feather plume. A well-shaped beard and mustache, flecked
<b>Floyd</b> | with gray, surround a mouth that breaks into a smile when he sees your
<b>Floyd</b> | master.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Zhuge Miao," he says, sounding like an echo of a once-booming voice.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Has it been long, my friend?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ages," Master Zhuge confirms, taking the ghost's hands in her own. "I
<b>Floyd</b> | have a go player to introduce you to while I tell you stories of the
<b>Floyd</b> | future."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The man looks at you sharply.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: I bow, in deference to this old friend of my master's.
<b>Floyd</b> | B: I bow, but only slightly. Surely I have greater status than a ghost!
<b>Floyd</b> | C: I remain frozen in place, unsure how to greet a ghost.

<b>Floyd</b> | laughs. "We will see what you say after I have defeated you at go!"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The house is far larger than the small cottage you expected, and more

<b>Floyd</b> | opposite the wall is the main section of the house, with a kitchen, a
<b>Floyd</b> | study, a dining room, and a bedroom. The two sides, connected to the
<b>Floyd</b> | main section of the house by open-air hallways at the corners, are
<b>Floyd</b> | large, empty spaces with smooth bamboo flooring. A final L-shaped
<b>Floyd</b> | building, which doubles as the wall around two sides of the property,

<b>Floyd</b> | to take your breath away at first sight. As you crest the last hill
<b>Floyd</b> | between you and the capital, the walled city stretches out in front of
<b>Floyd</b> | you, fading into mist, so that it appears that the city itself extends
<b>Floyd</b> | forever. A river runs through the center of the city, and one wall of
<b>Floyd</b> | the palace rubs against it like a cat against a friendly hand. The
<b>Floyd</b> | palace itself towers above the rest of the city, its golden calligraphy
<b>Floyd</b> | catching stray bits of light that float in through the mist, making it
<b>Floyd</b> | seem as though the whole building sparkles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Xiaonanhai is the center of the Middle Kingdom, its heart and its
<b>Floyd</b> | breath. It is a testament to the working of humans, and proof that
<b>Floyd</b> | human hands can create something lasting. It also buzzes like a hive of
<b>Floyd</b> | angry bees; anyone within its walls must be wary that they are not
<b>Floyd</b> | stung by criminals and bureaucrats alike.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The soldiers are eager to get you to the palace, given that you have
<b>Floyd</b> | arrived the day before the competition, but you persuade them to stop
<b>Floyd</b> | by Tai Thong, a pastry shop you remember fondly from the last time you
<b>Floyd</b> | were in Xiaonanhai. The proprietors treat all their customers like
<b>Floyd</b> | family, and the atmosphere gives a sense that, through pastries, one
<b>Floyd</b> | can achieve both peace and prosperity. You make a small purchase,
<b>Floyd</b> | setting a pork bun aside for Lu Jin, as Rong Jue thinks Lu Jin will be
<b>Floyd</b> | released into the custody of the Imperial soldiers as soon as you
<b>Floyd</b> | arrive at the palace.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Instead, however, you are escorted to a guest room in the palace,
<b>Floyd</b> | attended to by servants, all with the intent of making you comfortable
<b>Floyd</b> | while you wait for hours for further news. All of you ignore the fact
<b>Floyd</b> | that soldiers are stationed outside your door. Finally, after night has
<b>Floyd</b> | fallen, a thin and damp Lu Jin is ushered into your room. They have
<b>Floyd</b> | clearly just bathed him, in order to look presentable, you assume, for
<b>Floyd</b> | your competition.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: I go to Lu Jin's side immediately to make sure he is unharmed.
<b>Floyd</b> | B: We don't know who might be watching. I gesture to the table in the
<b>Floyd</b> | guest chamber and offer Lu Jin a pork bun.

<b>Floyd</b> | any time eating it. "So," he says finally, "I suppose you have a plan
<b>Floyd</b> | to defeat the foreigners. I hope you'll consider my ideas as well."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You agree to listen to Lu Jin's suggestions, though as he has been
<b>Floyd</b> | incarcerated for months, it appears, you wonder how he could have
<b>Floyd</b> | anything useful to add. As you sit together, Lu Jin gives you all the
<b>Floyd</b> | information about the competition he has been able to glean. The two
<b>Floyd</b> | foreign competitors are masters of an old sport combat style called
<b>Floyd</b> | jousting that is rarely practiced in Gower's home country except for
<b>Floyd</b> | entertainment. They will be wearing thick plates of armor and carrying
<b>Floyd</b> | shields, using long lances to try to unhorse or kill you in a direct
<b>Floyd</b> | charge. You will be provided with ji, spear-tipped halberds that have
<b>Floyd</b> | crescent blades around a sword-breaker on either side of the haft.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Their armor is an advantage on horseback, but we'll move much faster
<b>Floyd</b> | than they will on the ground," Lu Jin theorizes. "And they'll have
<b>Floyd</b> | limited visibility due to their helmets?we should be able to stay in
<b>Floyd</b> | their blind spots, again if we can bring them to the ground. The hard
<b>Floyd</b> | part about the armor is that it offers very few openings: their eyes
<b>Floyd</b> | and at the softer armor covering their joints?which is still heavy
<b>Floyd</b> | enough to deflect a blade."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your brain begins working around these issues. "We'll need to figure
<b>Floyd</b> | out their other disadvantages," you say, almost to yourself.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Or you could ask for help," says a familiar voice. The only remaining
<b>Floyd</b> | palace servant steps forward, and you instantly recognize Feng, despite
<b>Floyd</b> | the fox spirit's new disguise. Lu Jin looks at you in confusion, but
<b>Floyd</b> | you just nod for him to listen. "I can offer you these," Feng says,
<b>Floyd</b> | rolling two small vials out onto the palm of her hand. "Poison enough
<b>Floyd</b> | to coat one blade each."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lu Jin begins to reach for the poison.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: Feng has never led me astray before. This is a clever plan, even if
<b>Floyd</b> | it is dishonorable, and I am confident we can execute it without
<b>Floyd</b> | notice.
<b>Floyd</b> | B: Feng is a fox spirit?my companion or not, tempting monks into
<b>Floyd</b> | dishonor is in her nature. No good will come of taking up her offer.
<b>Floyd</b> | C: If we were caught using poison, we would be shown as dishonorable
<b>Floyd</b> | opponents. We cannot risk that loss of face, so we cannot accept the
<b>Floyd</b> | poison.
<b>Floyd</b> | D: We will not stoop to such a dishonorable tactic!

<b>Floyd</b> | "Then let's not get caught," Lu Jin says excitedly. "We need this sort

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You look at both Feng and Lu Jin, giving them your best teacher stare.
<b>Floyd</b> | "No," you say, "we don't. We can use the sword breakers on the ji to

<b>Floyd</b> | this?someone will find out eventually. And everything we're seeking to

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lu Jin weighs your words, then turns away. "May your confidence be

<b>Floyd</b> | step, and that soon you will reach the top?and it makes you smile. You
<b>Floyd</b> | wonder now where the Veiled Dragon may be, and whether she is still
<b>Floyd</b> | writing poetry.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You think for a moment that you see a flash of red?like the tail of a
<b>Floyd</b> | fox?against the mountain snow, but when you look, it is gone.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The way is cold, and the air is thin, but you go at a steady pace, and
<b>Floyd</b> | the activity keeps your body warm. You reach a large cave near the
<b>Floyd</b> | peak, which provides you with shelter against the wind, just as you see
<b>Floyd</b> | a thin shape spiraling down from the Heavens. Though the sky is covered
<b>Floyd</b> | in clouds, every once in a while, light catches off the yellow scales
<b>Floyd</b> | of the Dragon Sage, who grows larger with every heartbeat. The dragon's
<b>Floyd</b> | head is like a camel; its legs end in paws like a tiger's, with each
<b>Floyd</b> | toe capped in an eagle's claw. As it comes closer, you see its belly is
<b>Floyd</b> | like a clam, its neck is like a snake, and on its head are cow's ears,
<b>Floyd</b> | deer's horns, and demon eyes. The Dragon Sage descends, and its scales
<b>Floyd</b> | remind you of those of a carp, catching the glimmer of sunlight through
<b>Floyd</b> | the clouds as a fish's scales gleam beneath the water's surface. You
<b>Floyd</b> | had heard all of these qualities before?scholars have catalogued dragon
<b>Floyd</b> | bodies down to the number of scales?but seeing the combination in
<b>Floyd</b> | person is breathtaking.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As the Dragon Sage lands next to you, you find yourself holding your
<b>Floyd</b> | breath in awe. The dragon chuckles. "Greetings, monk," it says, in a
<b>Floyd</b> | voice that sounds like the rumble of thunder. You can feel it vibrate
<b>Floyd</b> | in your chest. "The time has come for you to ask me a question."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The moment has come. Long ago, you chose a question, but many years
<b>Floyd</b> | have passed, and you have grown and changed. With what you now know
<b>Floyd</b> | about the world and what you know about yourself, what question will
<b>Floyd</b> | you ask?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: How can I become the greatest warrior in the world?
<b>Floyd</b> | B: How can the Empire return to Heaven's Favor?
<b>Floyd</b> | C: What is the first question?
<b>Floyd</b> | D: Why do kites fly?

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | &gt; The Dragon Sage's demon eyes stare deeply into yours, and you can see
<b>Floyd</b> | your reflection dancing in them. "I have waited for a long time for
<b>Floyd</b> | someone to ask that question," it rumbles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The shared gaze becomes something like the mental combats you have
<b>Floyd</b> | practiced, but this is no fight, no challenge of wills. It is an
<b>Floyd</b> | invitation, and at once, you see the questions that the Dragon Sage has
<b>Floyd</b> | been asked over the years. You begin to understand what wisdom can be
<b>Floyd</b> | found in asking questions?and in listening to what is asked?rather than
<b>Floyd</b> | in simple answers. The knowledge floods you until you feel as though
<b>Floyd</b> | you are overflowing, pouring out of your body because it cannot contain
<b>Floyd</b> | the vast stores of wisdom you are receiving. All the questions that
<b>Floyd</b> | have ever been asked flow through you and around you like water.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When the flood ends, you realize that your reflection in the Dragon
<b>Floyd</b> | Sage's eyes shows the head of a camel, with the antlers of a deer and
<b>Floyd</b> | yellow scales that shimmer in the sunlight. The Dragon Sage in front of
<b>Floyd</b> | you begins to shimmer and dissolve into light. And you know that in a
<b>Floyd</b> | hundred years, you will return to this cave to answer the question of
<b>Floyd</b> | another monk.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And in listening to that question, you will learn something more about
<b>Floyd</b> | wisdom.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Dragon Sage has returned to the Heavens.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you had it to do all over again, what question would you ask?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: Play again.
<b>Floyd</b> | B: Play more games like this.
<b>Floyd</b> | C: Share this game with friends.
