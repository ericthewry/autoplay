The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Escape from Santaland</i>, written by Jason Ermer.  <I>Escape from Santaland</I> was originally released as part of the 2011 IF Competition, where it took fourth place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Escape_From_Santaland'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.

<b>Floyd</b> | Riverview Mall
<b>Floyd</b> | Ugh. Christmastime at the mall. The last place you want to be, during
<b>Floyd</b> | the worst time of year to be there.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After a last-minute Christmas Eve shopping run (thank you Aunt Maxine
<b>Floyd</b> | and Uncle Felix, who RSVP'd for tomorrow just an hour before the mall
<b>Floyd</b> | closed) you're heading for the parking lot, shopping bags in hand.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Everything about this place gives you a headache: the fluorescent
<b>Floyd</b> | lights reflecting off the polished faux-marble flooring, the greasy
<b>Floyd</b> | funk of the food court, the echoes of screaming children and Christmas
<b>Floyd</b> | music piped through tinny speakers. You have got to get out of here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But, where did you park? All of these mall entrances look the same. Are
<b>Floyd</b> | you going the right way? This doesn't look familiar...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The cartoony plastic signpost in front of you has two arrows, both of
<b>Floyd</b> | which point east toward a fake-snowy astroturf pathway between
<b>Floyd</b> | fake-holly hedges. One arrow reads "Pictures With Santa" the other
<b>Floyd</b> | reads "Parking Lots A-G".

<b>Floyd</b> | The Christmas puzzle has been a tradition in my family since my brother
<b>Floyd</b> | and I were very young.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At first, it was a way to extend the Christmas morning festivities
<b>Floyd</b> | during the years when there wasn't a lot of money for presents. My
<b>Floyd</b> | father would create a puzzle for each gifts tag -- usually a rebus --
<b>Floyd</b> | and my brother and I would have to solve the puzzle and guess at the
<b>Floyd</b> | package's contents before we could open it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As we grew up, the puzzles became more and more challenging. Plus, my
<b>Floyd</b> | brother and I wanted in on the action: we started to create puzzle tags
<b>Floyd</b> | for my father. Gifts would sometimes remain unopened for hours before
<b>Floyd</b> | the recipient had the breakthrough (or begged for the hint) that would
<b>Floyd</b> | solve the puzzle. We laughed a lot and we celebrated each other's
<b>Floyd</b> | creativity in both puzzle making and puzzle solving.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But my brother and I grew up and started out own lives. Years passed
<b>Floyd</b> | and the old Christmas traditions changed, as they must.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And yet sometimes, the old traditions are the best ones.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This holiday puzzle is dedicated to my father.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | *** Merry Christmas ***

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You arrive just as the larcenous little elf starts to climb down a

<b>Floyd</b> | an awkward angle. When he sees you, the elf yelps and grasps at the
<b>Floyd</b> | underside of the trap door in an attempt to tip the chair back onto its
<b>Floyd</b> | feet.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the process, he fumbles the gold statue, which skitters across the
<b>Floyd</b> | astroturf as the trap-door-chair slams shut. With that, the elf and
<b>Floyd</b> | your coat (and, unfortunately, your car keys) are gone.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Santa's big comfy chair stands in the center of the room. It's a
<b>Floyd</b> | dramatic affair, a throne really: lots of ostentatious gold-painted
<b>Floyd</b> | filigree and red velvet pillows.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Next to Santa's chair is a beautifully decorated Christmas tree. There
<b>Floyd</b> | are no presents beneath the tree, perhaps to better display the

<b>Floyd</b> | Pictures With Santa
<b>Floyd</b> | The heart of Santaland and the destination of families from miles
<b>Floyd</b> | around. It's not your destination, of course, but that doesn't change
<b>Floyd</b> | the fact that parents and children have for years made pilgrimages to
<b>Floyd</b> | this spot to have their pictures taken with Santa Claus.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Santa's big comfy chair stands in the center of the room. It's a
<b>Floyd</b> | dramatic affair, a throne really: lots of ostentatious gold-painted
<b>Floyd</b> | filigree and red velvet pillows.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Next to Santa's chair is a beautifully decorated Christmas tree. There
<b>Floyd</b> | are no presents beneath the tree, perhaps to better display the
<b>Floyd</b> | colorful decorative tree skirt underneath which was, until recently,
<b>Floyd</b> | spread out beneath it.

<b>Floyd</b> | Elves' Break Room

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | All of the drawers in the rickety desk have been dumped out onto the

<b>Floyd</b> | Pictures With Santa
<b>Floyd</b> | The heart of Santaland and the destination of families from miles
<b>Floyd</b> | around. It's not your destination, of course, but that doesn't change
<b>Floyd</b> | the fact that parents and children have for years made pilgrimages to
<b>Floyd</b> | this spot to have their pictures taken with Santa Claus.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Santa's big comfy chair  is tipped back, revealing the hidden staircase
<b>Floyd</b> | underneath. The stairs lead down into darkness.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Next to Santa's chair is a beautifully decorated Christmas tree. There
<b>Floyd</b> | are no presents beneath the tree, perhaps to better display the
<b>Floyd</b> | colorful decorative tree skirt underneath which was, until recently,
<b>Floyd</b> | spread out beneath it.

<b>Floyd</b> | Depot
<b>Floyd</b> | Here kids can (beg their parents to) pay an additional $5 to have their
<b>Floyd</b> | picture taken aboard the H&O Railroad. In other malls, you recall
<b>Floyd</b> | seeing Santaland setups with working trains chugging along through
<b>Floyd</b> | their little Santa-scapes, but this one seems much less elaborate.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the hedge wall to the south stands the stony arch of a tunnel. From
<b>Floyd</b> | the tunnel emerges a narrow set of train tracks. The tracks run north
<b>Floyd</b> | across the turf and slip under a closed door in the hedge.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The brightly-colored locomotive sits on the tracks.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The facade of a little ticket booth stands next to the tunnel.

<b>Floyd</b> | You are at the snowy, narrow intersection of several passages.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | From here, pathways lead to the west (back to the train depot) and the
<b>Floyd</b> | north (back toward the mall exit).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the wall to the east is a door that someone has tried,
<b>Floyd</b> | unsuccessfully, to camouflage. Bits of fake holly are stuck to it, but
<b>Floyd</b> | not enough that it blends in with the rest of the hedges. Plus, they
<b>Floyd</b> | did nothing to hide the shiny doorknob.

<b>Floyd</b> | You stand on the border between Santaland and the rest of the world,
<b>Floyd</b> | where the maze of fake shrubbery finally gives way to shiny, angular

<b>Floyd</b> | see polished PVC flooring.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The mall exit lies just to the north: two sets of shiny glass doors and
