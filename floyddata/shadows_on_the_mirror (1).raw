The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>shadows on the mirror</i>, written by Chrysoula Tzavelas.  <I>shadows on the mirror</I> was originally released as part of the 2003 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took sixth place. It went on to be nominated for three Xyzzy awards: Best NPCs, Best Individual NPC, and Best Individual PC.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Shadows_on_the_mirror'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's raining out.  You lean your head against the window, the glass
<b>Floyd</b> | cold against your cheek, and watch the world slide by.  The city is as
<b>Floyd</b> | grey as the skies, but rainbows catch in the trembling drops of water.
<b>Floyd</b> | The swish-slap of the windshield wipers and low hum of the air
<b>Floyd</b> | conditioner covers up the faint sound of his breathing.  If you close
<b>Floyd</b> | your eyes, you can almost be somewhere else.  Maybe if you try...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You tremble inside like a raindrop on the verge of falling, fighting
<b>Floyd</b> | to spread yourself out, let yourself drift away into the sky, away
<b>Floyd</b> | from this car, away from him, away from the fate ahead.  But even with
<b>Floyd</b> | the fear, it's so hard to move on...  or maybe because of the fear.
<b>Floyd</b> | Metal snugs around your wrist as he tightens the cuff, shattering your
<b>Floyd</b> | concentration.  "None of that," he says.  His voice isn't even cold,
<b>Floyd</b> | it's just empty.  He touches a panel on the car's dashboard.  "We'll
<b>Floyd</b> | be there soon," he adds.  Soon.

<b>Floyd</b> | I drew a picture on the window as we rode
<b>Floyd</b> | Then I wiped it dry to see the other side
<b>Floyd</b> | I see no more than you do
<b>Floyd</b> | Believe me, I've tried

<b>Floyd</b> | To write the words to my happy-ending November song

<b>Floyd</b> | - "November Song," Mark Henley
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Car
<b>Floyd</b> | The car is large and comfortable, but it's still just a traveling
<b>Floyd</b> | cage, upholstered in sleek grey.  The control panel on his side
<b>Floyd</b> | flashes discreet symbols you never learned to read, but in the center
<b>Floyd</b> | of the dashboard is the stereo, and above it hangs a mirror.  The car
<b>Floyd</b> | has a back seat as well as a front; usually his kind comes in groups.
<b>Floyd</b> | There's only a plain black briefcase back there, though.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your backpack is on the floor.

<b>Floyd</b> | He cast such a shadow in your dreams.  But when you looked up in the
<b>Floyd</b> | park and saw him standing there in front of you, just a man, you could
<b>Floyd</b> | barely believe it.  This is what had been hunting you, night and day,
<b>Floyd</b> | across world and wane?  Not so tall, almost slight in build,
<b>Floyd</b> | unremarkable brown hair.  But then his hand closed around your arm,
<b>Floyd</b> | stronger than the silver band there now, and you knew him.  "Your
<b>Floyd</b> | grandfather asked me to find you, Enra," he said, and caught you as
<b>Floyd</b> | your knees buckled.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He's wearing an expensive-looking pair of shades that scrape across
<b>Floyd</b> | your nerves.  His suit is very fine, although it bears the signs of
<b>Floyd</b> | being driven in for many hours.  It's typical Man In Black garb.
<b>Floyd</b> | Silver glints at his neck.

<b>Floyd</b> | on it, breaking it into a thousand glittering pieces, and he took the
<b>Floyd</b> | rose pin that Bobby had given you, snorted, and tossed it into the

<b>Floyd</b> | from this car, away from him, away from the fate ahead.  But even with
<b>Floyd</b> | the fear, it's so hard to move on...  or maybe because of the fear.
<b>Floyd</b> | Metal snugs around your wrist as he tightens the cuff, shattering your
<b>Floyd</b> | concentration.  "None of that," he says.  His voice isn't even cold,
<b>Floyd</b> | it's just empty.  He touches a panel on the car's dashboard.  "We'll

<b>Floyd</b> | The car is large and comfortable, but it's still just a traveling

<b>Floyd</b> | has a back seat as well as a front; usually his kind comes in groups.
