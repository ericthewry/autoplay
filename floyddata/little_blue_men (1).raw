The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Little Blue Men</i>, written by Michael&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Gentry.  <i>Little Blue Men</i> was originally released during the 1998 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took 7th place.  It received XYZZY nominations for Best Individual PC, Best Game, Best Writing, Best Story, and Best Individual Puzzle, and ultimately took the XYZZY for Best Individual PC.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/471"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>,</BR>

</br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | shocking and sometimes offensive trappings of style, and appreciate
<b>Floyd</b> | the game's message for its inner substance.

<b>Floyd</b> | This game is a joke.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game is a warning.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game is a satire.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game is inspired in equal parts by Vaclav Havel's The Memorandum
<b>Floyd</b> | and Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game is a big, stupid shaggy dog story.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | This game started out as a very silly game, and at some point during
<b>Floyd</b> | the design process it turned into a very serious game instead -- too
<b>Floyd</b> | far from the beginning to go back and rewrite everything to make the
<b>Floyd</b> | mood more consistent, too far from the end to play it down to the
<b>Floyd</b> | level of a minor punchline. The result is a kind of rushed and uneven
<b>Floyd</b> | mixture of gonzo humor and surreal horror that didn't turn out to be

<b>Floyd</b> | the polished, concise masterwork I had hoped it would be, but perhaps
<b>Floyd</b> | it will make for an interesting playing experience, nonetheless.
<b>Floyd</b> | Anyway, have fun.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Like most vending machines, it is essentially a refrigerator-sized box
<b>Floyd</b> | with a glass front, behind which can be seen several rows of assorted
<b>Floyd</b> | treats. There is a panel of buttons to the side, beneath which is a
<b>Floyd</b> | slot for coins, a bill changer for paper money, and a cup for your

<b>Floyd</b> | change. Insert your money, make your selection, and your snack drops
<b>Floyd</b> | from the appropriate row into the receptacle bin at the bottom of the
<b>Floyd</b> | machine.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Simple.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | But there is more to this vending machine than only that.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You hate this vending machine. You hate it more than just about
<b>Floyd</b> | anything or anyone else in this office. This vending machine was
<b>Floyd</b> | designed to hammer home a keen sense of the futility of existence; to
<b>Floyd</b> | taunt you with life's possibilities only to forever harass and

<b>Floyd</b> | frustrate your every attempt to grasp them. The machine never has
<b>Floyd</b> | anything you want. And even if it did, you couldn't buy it because you
<b>Floyd</b> | never have any change and the machine will only take mint-condition
<b>Floyd</b> | bills crisp enough to scoop bean dip with. And even if, by some
<b>Floyd</b> | fantastic stroke of luck, you did have change, and there was something
<b>Floyd</b> | remotely edible in the machine that you actually wanted, you'd still

<b>Floyd</b> | never be able to get it, because the merchandise invariably gets stuck
<b>Floyd</b> | before dropping into the receptacle, and no amount of shaking will
<b>Floyd</b> | bring it down unless you happen to be that son of a bitch Benson, who
<b>Floyd</b> | somehow always manages to retrieve his disgusting nougat bars with a
<b>Floyd</b> | single, insultingly skillful jiggle. Otherwise, forget it.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The machine is your nemesis. Someday -- and you know that day is fast
<b>Floyd</b> | approaching, you must destroy it... or it will destroy you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Benson strolls by and heads straight for the vending machine, ignoring
<b>Floyd</b> | you completely. He pops a few coins into the slot and pushes 'A'.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The machine dutifully grinds out another nougat bar, which snags on
<b>Floyd</b> | the wire, like always, just before it can drop into the receptacle.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Benson leans his hip against the machine and gives it a deft shove.
<b>Floyd</b> | The nougat bar shakes free immediately and drops into the receptacle..
<b>Floyd</b> | Satisfied, he retrieves his prize, digs his change out of the change

<b>Floyd</b> | cup, and heads back to his desk, already stuffing the end of the

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Benson strolls by and heads straight for the vending machine, ignoring
<b>Floyd</b> | you completely. He pops a few coins into the slot and pushes 'A'.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The machine dutifully grinds out another nougat bar, which snags on
<b>Floyd</b> | the wire, like always, just before it can drop into the receptacle.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Benson leans his hip against the machine and gives it a deft shove.
<b>Floyd</b> | The machine rocks back alarmingly, comes forward again, overbalances
<b>Floyd</b> | and tips over. Benson never even sees it coming. Glass breaks,
<b>Floyd</b> | Beechnut flies everywhere, and the machine, which weighs in excess of
<b>Floyd</b> | 1,500 pounds, crushes the hapless son of a bitch before he can even
<b>Floyd</b> | squawk for help.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Satisfying; very satisfying. Looks like Benson and the machine both
<b>Floyd</b> | got what was coming to them. By pitting your enemies against one
<b>Floyd</b> | another, you've come out on top.

<b>Floyd</b> | "What? Are you shitting me? THIS is how it ends?!?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Well, yes. It took me weeks to figure out what the ending of this game
<b>Floyd</b> | should be, and when the land of fat naked men finally dawned on me, I
<b>Floyd</b> | realized that it was the only ending that could possibly make sense
<b>Floyd</b> | and still be true to the story.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then, later, I decided that it was really just a cheap, cop-out,
<b>Floyd</b> | shaggy dog ending and a lot of people would be pissed at me.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now I'm kind of leaning the other way again.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | But it's also occurred to me that I could use this unconventional
<b>Floyd</b> | ending as an opportunity to take an analytical crowbar, if you will,
<b>Floyd</b> | to certain pre-conceived notions we have about how IF is structured. I
<b>Floyd</b> | don't want to attach too much unwarranted significance to this: I
<b>Floyd</b> | didn't, after all, start out writing this game with these themes in
<b>Floyd</b> | mind. But various comments from my beta-testers got me thinking about

<b>Floyd</b> | these ideas, and I think they might be worth discussing, so I'll just
<b>Floyd</b> | pass them right along to you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So let this, then, be my actual contribution to IF Comp '98. If even
<b>Floyd</b> | one of these points gets mentioned on RAIF, I will feel just as
<b>Floyd</b> | rewarded as though I were already popping open that can of Ass-Kickin'

<b>Floyd</b> | Peanuts.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Think about it, for a minute:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Is this the most "optimal" ending in the game?
<b>Floyd</b> | (And I don't mean just because you get to read this postscript!)

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Are any of the endings in the game "optimal"?
<b>Floyd</b> | (I will maintain that getting crushed by the vending machine is a
<b>Floyd</b> | definite loser; otherwise, any ending is up for grabs.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Is this ending true to the story? Was it inevitable? Could this story

<b>Floyd</b> | have ended any other way?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Do the motivations of the main character in a work of IF always need
<b>Floyd</b> | to be the same as the motivations of the person playing it? What if
<b>Floyd</b> | the main character is thoroughly dislikable, or his motivations
<b>Floyd</b> | morally repugnant?

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Does the ultimate goal of the main character in a work of IF always
<b>Floyd</b> | need to coincide with what the player feels is the "optimal" ending?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If what is optimal for the player doesn't jive with what is optimal
<b>Floyd</b> | for the main character, then how does one "win" the game?

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Maybe you should have just tossed the paperwork in the out-tray a
<b>Floyd</b> | second time -- a winning score in less than 10 moves. Is the object of
<b>Floyd</b> | this game really to get totally frosty -- or is it to stay totally
<b>Floyd</b> | steamed?
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Have you actually won this game?

<b>Floyd</b> | although whatever vague conceptions you ever had about cherubs (and

<b>Floyd</b> | "You'll need these," he tells you, handing you a pink balloon and a

<b>Floyd</b> | You are standing at the top of a hill of velvety green, overlooking a
<b>Floyd</b> | scene of pastoral delight. In the valley below, young men and women in
<b>Floyd</b> | wispy robes frolic chastely about, dancing together amongst the
<b>Floyd</b> | wildflowers and the romping sheep. Everyone is laughing. Everyone has
<b>Floyd</b> | a pretty pink balloon that they hold by its string. It is innocence
<b>Floyd</b> | and carefree, everywhere you look.

<b>Floyd</b> | The fat naked man beams at you seraphically.

<b>Floyd</b> | "You'll need these," he tells you, handing you a pink balloon and a
