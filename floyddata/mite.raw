The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Mite</i>, written by Sara Dee.  <I>Mite</I> was originally released as part of the 2010 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took sixth place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Mite'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | You hadn't counted on running into a thief that morning. To be fair,
<b>Floyd</b> | he probably wasn't expecting you either. You were outside minding your
<b>Floyd</b> | own business, working to mend a portion of the fence that surrounds
<b>Floyd</b> | your family's shack, when you spotted a dark figure tearing through
<b>Floyd</b> | the fields.  Startled by the unusual sight, you couldn't help but call

<b>Floyd</b> | apparently headed for the dirt path behind you, you noticed a curious
<b>Floyd</b> | bulge at his side.  Something about it just wasn't right. And that's
<b>Floyd</b> | partly why you did what you did.

<b>Floyd</b> | A millisecond before the caped sprinter was upon you, you stuck out

<b>Floyd</b> | never heard before... Trollish, perhaps.  He quickly got to his feet

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Just what is this?!"  Your attention snapped back to the scene at

<b>Floyd</b> | egg-shaped gem out of a tall patch of grass.  It looked like nothing
<b>Floyd</b> | you'd ever seen before.  It was, in fact, the most beautiful thing
<b>Floyd</b> | you'd ever seen.  The jewel glittered beneath a thin layer of dust,
<b>Floyd</b> | casting prisms of light in every direction.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Can we keep it?" you finally managed, glancing up at your equally
<b>Floyd</b> | enthralled father. He studied the jewel for a moment more, tilting it
<b>Floyd</b> | this way and that.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Aha! Look!" He pointed to one edge.  You could just make out the
<b>Floyd</b> | delicate, silvery script:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "PROPERTY OF THE FAIRY PRINCE".

<b>Floyd</b> | At a Fork in the Path
<b>Floyd</b> | You've never been to this region of the Great Garden before. That's
<b>Floyd</b> | not so surprising, really. The Garden is vast and full of mysteries,
<b>Floyd</b> | and this is your first official trip beyond the cluster of villages
<b>Floyd</b> | that you call home. Though the lands are relatively safe for travel
<b>Floyd</b> | (the Fairy Prince having banished most of the goblins, bogies, and
<b>Floyd</b> | other mischievous creatures to the realm beyond the hedges long ago)
<b>Floyd</b> | the largeness of everything around you makes you feel more than a bit
<b>Floyd</b> | nervous.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You are currently standing at a fork in the path on which you've been
<b>Floyd</b> | traveling for what's seemed like hours. The hefty gem strapped to your
<b>Floyd</b> | back hasn't helped matters.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your options are north and east. The road back home is to the west.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Pixies were meant to explore and have fun, and you're certainly at

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Sorry--," you start to say, but with one flap of its wings, the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally you are able to take in your surroundings. The amber petals of

<b>Floyd</b> | garden. Unfortunately, you discover that the view isn't that much

<b>Floyd</b> | By the Giant Gnome Statue
<b>Floyd</b> | It's all almost too much to take in. The wide clearing that you have
<b>Floyd</b> | stumbled into is dominated by a giant statue of a gnome. It's the most
<b>Floyd</b> | peculiar thing you've ever seen and you can only guess what its
<b>Floyd</b> | purpose is. But you are unable to dwell on that for long, because
<b>Floyd</b> | perched on the shoulder of the gnome, high overhead, an ugly hobgoblin
<b>Floyd</b> | is crouched, one bony gray arm wrapped around the gem.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Give that back!" you shout. The goblin offers another fiendish
<b>Floyd</b> | chuckle and says something in a language you don't understand.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "That jewel belongs to the Fairy Prince!" you continue, but the goblin
<b>Floyd</b> | doesn't seem to care. He holds the gem up, marveling at the
<b>Floyd</b> | coruscating colors it produces in the sunlight. While he is
<b>Floyd</b> | distracted, you attempt to scale the gnome, but lacking the goblin's
<b>Floyd</b> | sharp black claws, you are unable to get a solid grip on anything.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What am I going to do now?  You've come too far to let this
<b>Floyd</b> | contemptible creature make off with the jewel.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You observe, with little sense of relief, that your familiar dirt path
<b>Floyd</b> | has reappeared. It continues south from here. To the west, beyond the
<b>Floyd</b> | offending cattail that caused this mess, you see the opening leading
<b>Floyd</b> | back to the beach.

<b>Floyd</b> | Revolutionary Headquarters
<b>Floyd</b> | In future generations, this building may well be a museum, for this is
<b>Floyd</b> | where the People's Committee for the Revolution made their glorious
<b>Floyd</b> | plans to liberate all who are oppressed! The red light that
<b>Floyd</b> | illuminates the room might cause eye strain and make it hard to work,
<b>Floyd</b> | but it is truly inspiring.
<b>Floyd</b> | You can exit the headquarters to the west (how appropriate!) and a
<b>Floyd</b> | staircase leads downwards to the lab.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A giant workers' flag hangs on the back wall, filling your heart with
<b>Floyd</b> | Revolutionary Pride.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Underneath the flag sits the committee's desk, upon which all
<b>Floyd</b> | Revolutionary Managerial Work is accomplished.
