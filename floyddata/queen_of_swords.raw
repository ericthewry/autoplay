<b>Floyd</b> | Each week, you spend four hours round-trip in a car to take a
<b>Floyd</b> | beginner's fencing class at the Virginia Academy of Fencing in
<b>Floyd</b> | Springfield. It's fun, you tell yourself, and it never hurts to be more
<b>Floyd</b> | active. David, on the other hand, wants to compete. Your husband wants

<b>Floyd</b> | to join the U.S. Fencing Association and begin competing in regional
<b>Floyd</b> | tournaments after only eight weeks of classes, when they tell people to
<b>Floyd</b> | take lessons for a whole year before competing. However, David will
<b>Floyd</b> | want what David will want, and you love your husband dearly, so...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There's a tournament in Glen Falls this weekend, and you're going. On

<b>Floyd</b> | your last trip to VAF you spent over $900 on electric fencing
<b>Floyd</b> | equipment. The real problem is going to figure out how to use all of
<b>Floyd</b> | it: what plugs into where, which piece you need to put on first, and
<b>Floyd</b> | how to fence with a floor cord holding you back. That's why you and
<b>Floyd</b> | David are going to use tonight, while you have the room at the local
<b>Floyd</b> | library reserved, to practice gearing up for electric.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | David gets a good parking spot downtown, and the two of you haul the
<b>Floyd</b> | bags of equipment out of the trunk and into the library. The librarians
<b>Floyd</b> | wave at you as you pass, already used to seeing you, and the two of you
<b>Floyd</b> | make your way to one of the larger meeting rooms upstairs to set up the
<b>Floyd</b> | electric strip.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | David drops his equipment bag near the door and smiles at you. "I'll
<b>Floyd</b> | put the strip up," he says. "Why don't you go ahead and get your stuff
<b>Floyd</b> | on?" You look at your bag uncertainly. "I'm not sure I know where
<b>Floyd</b> | everything goes," you say. He grins. "Me neither," he says. "If you
<b>Floyd</b> | have trouble, let me know, and I'll try to help." He takes the bag with

<b>Floyd</b> | the scoring box and floor reels and goes to set up a table. You survey
<b>Floyd</b> | the room.

<b>Floyd</b> | McIntire Meeting Room, Downtown Library

<b>Floyd</b> | A large, open room, with plenty of room for a few fencers to practice.
<b>Floyd</b> | Of course, tonight it's just you and David. A row of tall windows line
<b>Floyd</b> | the western wall, and stacks of chairs are at either end of the long
<b>Floyd</b> | north-south room. The door to the hallway is east. An industrial-type
<b>Floyd</b> | carpet in garish red covers the floor.

<b>Floyd</b> | The open windows let in a welcome breeze.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | "The Queen of Swords" was written as an entry in the Event Division of

<b>Floyd</b> | the 2003 Interactive Fiction Art Show, organized by Marnie Parker. For
<b>Floyd</b> | more information about fencing, and some general tips on exploring this
<b>Floyd</b> | work, players may wish to type HELP. Experienced IF players will find
<b>Floyd</b> | it sufficient to note that examining objects may be important; that
<b>Floyd</b> | David is a source of help; and that the verb ATTACH can be quite
<b>Floyd</b> | useful. The most important fencing verb is, well, FENCE. The work tries

<b>Floyd</b> | to convey a close approximation of the preparation for fencing with
<b>Floyd</b> | electric gear, fiddly bits and all.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, thanks to Andrew Plotkin for his answers on raif and advice on
<b>Floyd</b> | his website. Oh, one final note: the game refers to a "lam?," but for
<b>Floyd</b> | simplicity's sake, you may type "lame." (It's still pronounced

<b>Floyd</b> | Each week, you spend four hours round-trip in a car to take a
<b>Floyd</b> | beginner's fencing class at the Virginia Academy of Fencing in
<b>Floyd</b> | Springfield. It's fun, you tell yourself, and it never hurts to be more
<b>Floyd</b> | active. David, on the other hand, wants to compete. Your husband wants
<b>Floyd</b> | to join the U.S. Fencing Association and begin competing in regional
<b>Floyd</b> | tournaments after only eight weeks of classes, when they tell people to

<b>Floyd</b> | take lessons for a whole year before competing. However, David will
<b>Floyd</b> | want what David will want, and you love your husband dearly, so...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There's a tournament in Glen Falls this weekend, and you're going. On
<b>Floyd</b> | your last trip to VAF you spent over $900 on electric fencing
<b>Floyd</b> | equipment. The real problem is going to figure out how to use all of

<b>Floyd</b> | it: what plugs into where, which piece you need to put on first, and
<b>Floyd</b> | how to fence with a floor cord holding you back. That's why you and
<b>Floyd</b> | David are going to use tonight, while you have the room at the local
<b>Floyd</b> | library reserved, to practice gearing up for electric.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | David gets a good parking spot downtown, and the two of you haul the

<b>Floyd</b> | bags of equipment out of the trunk and into the library. The librarians
<b>Floyd</b> | wave at you as you pass, already used to seeing you, and the two of you
<b>Floyd</b> | make your way to one of the larger meeting rooms upstairs to set up the
<b>Floyd</b> | electric strip.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | David drops his equipment bag near the door and smiles at you. "I'll

<b>Floyd</b> | put the strip up," he says. "Why don't you go ahead and get your stuff
<b>Floyd</b> | on?" You look at your bag uncertainly. "I'm not sure I know where
<b>Floyd</b> | everything goes," you say. He grins. "Me neither," he says. "If you
<b>Floyd</b> | have trouble, let me know, and I'll try to help." He takes the bag with
<b>Floyd</b> | the scoring box and floor reels and goes to set up a table. You survey
<b>Floyd</b> | the room.

<b>Floyd</b> | Quick tip: to see if you're hooked up yet, you can always try SALUTE or
<b>Floyd</b> | FENCE.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Fencing is, to various degrees and various people, a sport and a hobby.
<b>Floyd</b> | Today's Olympic-style sport is derived from the older, classical style
<b>Floyd</b> | of swordplay developed in Europe over the last several hundred years.
<b>Floyd</b> | In this work, as in the USFA (www.usfencing.org), the modern rules and
<b>Floyd</b> | styles are used.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | What that means to you is that the director (person who scores the
<b>Floyd</b> | match, or referee) is aided by electrical equipment: each fencer wears
<b>Floyd</b> | a metal vest called a lam? and plugs their foil (the weapon used in our
<b>Floyd</b> | game) into a box with lights. When the plunger on the tip of your foil
<b>Floyd</b> | is depressed (usually against the opponent), one of the lights on the
<b>Floyd</b> | box will light up. If *your* foil contacted *my* lam?, your colored

<b>Floyd</b> | light (either red or green, depending on which side you're on) will
<b>Floyd</b> | light up, indicating a touch on a valid target (which could score a
<b>Floyd</b> | point or "touch"). If your foil contacted anything else (my arm or leg,
<b>Floyd</b> | your shoe, the floor, the director), then the white light (we both have
<b>Floyd</b> | one colored and one white) will light up. The director watches the
<b>Floyd</b> | action, watches the box, and decides who, if anyone, gets a point each

<b>Floyd</b> | time he or she stops the action.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It gets a bit more complicated when both fencers score a valid hit, but
<b>Floyd</b> | suffice it to say that the director must decide which of the two had
<b>Floyd</b> | priority, or right-of-way, to attack. That person is awarded the touch.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Anyway, the important thing for you to figure out is just how to set up
<b>Floyd</b> | the electric circuits in the first place. The different circuits allow
<b>Floyd</b> | the box to distinguish between on-target and off-target hits; that is
<b>Floyd</b> | why your lam? must be connected to the circuit somehow. Obviously your
<b>Floyd</b> | foil has to be connected, so that the box will register when your foil
<b>Floyd</b> | tip is depressed. And all of it has to be reported back to the box over

<b>Floyd</b> | an electric circuit.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For more hints as to what needs to be connected where, be sure to
<b>Floyd</b> | examine everything, maybe even the things David sets up.

<b>Floyd</b> | Each week, you spend four hours round-trip in a car to take a
<b>Floyd</b> | beginner's fencing class at the Virginia Academy of Fencing in

<b>Floyd</b> | Springfield. It's fun, you tell yourself, and it never hurts to be more
<b>Floyd</b> | active. David, on the other hand, wants to compete. Your husband wants
<b>Floyd</b> | to join the U.S. Fencing Association and begin competing in regional
<b>Floyd</b> | tournaments after only eight weeks of classes, when they tell people to
<b>Floyd</b> | take lessons for a whole year before competing. However, David will
<b>Floyd</b> | want what David will want, and you love your husband dearly, so...

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There's a tournament in Glen Falls this weekend, and you're going. On
<b>Floyd</b> | your last trip to VAF you spent over $900 on electric fencing
<b>Floyd</b> | equipment. The real problem is going to figure out how to use all of
<b>Floyd</b> | it: what plugs into where, which piece you need to put on first, and
<b>Floyd</b> | how to fence with a floor cord holding you back. That's why you and

<b>Floyd</b> | David are going to use tonight, while you have the room at the local
<b>Floyd</b> | library reserved, to practice gearing up for electric.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | David gets a good parking spot downtown, and the two of you haul the
<b>Floyd</b> | bags of equipment out of the trunk and into the library. The librarians
<b>Floyd</b> | wave at you as you pass, already used to seeing you, and the two of you

<b>Floyd</b> | make your way to one of the larger meeting rooms upstairs to set up the
<b>Floyd</b> | electric strip.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | David drops his equipment bag near the door and smiles at you. "I'll
<b>Floyd</b> | put the strip up," he says. "Why don't you go ahead and get your stuff
<b>Floyd</b> | on?" You look at your bag uncertainly. "I'm not sure I know where

<b>Floyd</b> | everything goes," you say. He grins. "Me neither," he says. "If you
<b>Floyd</b> | have trouble, let me know, and I'll try to help." He takes the bag with
<b>Floyd</b> | the scoring box and floor reels and goes to set up a table. You survey
<b>Floyd</b> | the room.

<b>Floyd</b> | forward (advances) and back (retreats), while waiting for him to make

<b>Floyd</b> | the first move. The floor cord tugs gently at you, through the hook-up
<b>Floyd</b> | on the D-ring, but after a few moments you don't notice it at all.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | David makes a few feints, which you ignore, and then suddenly he is
<b>Floyd</b> | attacking! You try to parry, but it comes too late, and a loud buzz
<b>Floyd</b> | emanates from the scoring box. You look at the box, and see David's red

<b>Floyd</b> | light glowing, indicating that he scored a valid touch. You knew that
<b>Floyd</b> | much; you can still feel the spot on your chest where he landed. But to
<b>Floyd</b> | see it on the box is so exciting!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "One," you say to David, holding up a finger to indicate that he scored
<b>Floyd</b> | a touch. He nods, and backs up to his en guarde line. You both pause,

<b>Floyd</b> | and then begin fencing again. This time, you think, maybe it isn't such
<b>Floyd</b> | a good idea to try to defend, since he is so much faster than I am!
<b>Floyd</b> | With that in mind, you spring forward, tapping David's blade aside as
<b>Floyd</b> | you lunge (a "beat attack"). But David is fast, and he recovers from
<b>Floyd</b> | the beat in time to parry your attack. His riposte comes for you, and
<b>Floyd</b> | you do your best to parry it, but the buzzing of the score box can't be

<b>Floyd</b> | denied.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This time, there are two lights: David's red on-target light, and your
<b>Floyd</b> | white off-target light. You must have hit him off-target somewhere in

<b>Floyd</b> | in two weeks for the TIGSource Text the Halls competition.  This is

<b>Floyd</b> | intended to be a puzzle-less game, but if you do get stuck, type HINTS
<b>Floyd</b> | to read some relevant pointers.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Some notes about conversations: converse using 'ASK/TELL [character]
<b>Floyd</b> | ABOUT [subject]'.  Type 'TOPICS' to see a list of subjects that your
<b>Floyd</b> | character thinks are currently relevant.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | From time to time you'll see some more unusual responses suggested in
<b>Floyd</b> | brackets, for example '(You could remind Leonard who you are, or
<b>Floyd</b> | pretend not to know him)'.  Sometimes you can simply change the subject
<b>Floyd</b> | to something else, but often you'll have to choose one of the suggested
<b>Floyd</b> | actions (although typing REMIND or PRETEND should suffice).

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If your interpreter is spiffy enough, conversations will feature blue,
<b>Floyd</b> | underlined hyperlinks that you can click on to follow the flow of the
<b>Floyd</b> | dialogue.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, note that the path through this game is short and

<b>Floyd</b> | straightforward.  You can spend a lot of time talking with the other
<b>Floyd</b> | character, but you don't have to if you don't want.

<b>Floyd</b> | The night is cold, and the two of you cling to one another for warmth,

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Then the two of you struggle to your feet, Imelda just contending with

<b>Floyd</b> | Looking around at the pristine forest, everything covered in thick
<b>Floyd</b> | sheets of snow, you begin to make your way north, Imelda encouraging

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Is this a conjugal visit?" you ask her.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She looks puzzled.  "Have I ever made any other kind of visit?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She walks across your improbably luxurious cabin - not that you're

<b>Floyd</b> | Years later...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Imelda rolls off of you and sparks up a cigarette, the sheets around
<b>Floyd</b> | her hips.  You study her silhouette in the twilight.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "The air race tomorrow," she says.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Everyone will be there," you say proudly.  "Everyone wants to see the
<b>Floyd</b> | world's most famous aces competing against one another."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She takes a deep drag and lets the smoke curl slowly from her lips

<b>Floyd</b> | before speaking.  "I just want to make sure you know I won't hold back,
<b>Floyd</b> | just because it's you."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You laugh.  "You're not going to get a chance to.  You'll have to be
<b>Floyd</b> | flat out just to be able to spot me on the horizon."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | She holds out her hand and you take it.  "May the best woman win," she
<b>Floyd</b> | says.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "May she come second, after me," you counter.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There's a moment's pause.  The quiet sounds of evening drift in through

<b>Floyd</b> | an open window.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Lucas..."  Imelda takes a deep breath.  "There's something I need to
<b>Floyd</b> | ask you.  After the race, what... what's going to happen?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Easy," you say.  "I go where you go.  As always."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She smiles.  "That's going to be difficult.  I'll be going where you're
<b>Floyd</b> | going.  We'll be chasing one another in circles."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Like dogfighting all over again."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The champagne cork pops explosively and you both jump.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Careful," Imelda says, "you'll have someone's eye out."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You pour out two glasses.  "Yes, you have to be careful in that

<b>Floyd</b> | regard."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Thank you," Imelda says, taking a glass and bringing it to her lips.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Hold on, we haven't had a toast yet."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "That's easy," she says, raising her glass.  "To us.  And another
<b>Floyd</b> | twenty years of fucking, flying and friendship."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "To the three 'F's," you agree, tapping your glass against hers.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The three 'F's."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You take a deep breath of mountain air.  The precarious buildings of
<b>Floyd</b> | Aerocity surround you, glistening with frost.  "It's quite a view," you
<b>Floyd</b> | say, looking across the world from up high.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "As good as flying," Imelda says.  "Almost as good as love."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You lean together and kiss, the setting sun glinting on snow-topped

<b>Floyd</b> | The night is cold, and the two of you cling to one another for warmth,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then the two of you struggle to your feet, Imelda just contending with
<b>Floyd</b> | aches and cramps while you have to worry about your broken leg.

<b>Floyd</b> | Looking around at the pristine forest, everything covered in thick

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm really sorry for this," you tell her.  "It seems the intelligence

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "They accepted it when I refused to answer their questions, yes.  The

<b>Floyd</b> | "The air race tomorrow," she says.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Everyone will be there," you say proudly.  "Everyone wants to see the
<b>Floyd</b> | world's most famous aces competing against one another."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She takes a deep drag and lets the smoke curl slowly from her lips

<b>Floyd</b> | before speaking.  "I don't like the way you take so many risks to try
<b>Floyd</b> | and beat me.  You could die."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You laugh.  "You just want to make sure you win."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She shoots you a fierce look.  "I'm not joking."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Okay, I know, Mel, I know."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You rest your hand reassuringly on her leg.  "Maybe we should pack in

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She places her hand on top of yours."We have one another."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "We'll see."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There's a moment's pause.  The quiet sounds of evening drift in through

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Lucas..."  Imelda takes a deep breath.  "There's something I need to
<b>Floyd</b> | ask you.  After the race, what... what's going to happen?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I..."  You shake your head.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | She looks at you sadly.  "Yeah, you never did let that barrier drop.  I
<b>Floyd</b> | guess it's too much to imagine that people who've tried to kill one
<b>Floyd</b> | another could ever end up being too close."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I will miss you," you tell her.

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Sounds like a plan."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Are you still the dashing bachelor of legend?"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You look thoughtfully at the sky.  "Oh, you know how it is.  You meet a

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She looks at you thoughfully.  "You're a stupid bastard, Lucas Thane,"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You just stare at her.

<b>Floyd</b> | enemy pilots, whether dead or alive, would always be treated with
<b>Floyd</b> | respect and courtesy by their opposing squadrons.  (It was whilst
<b>Floyd</b> | talking to one captured allied pilot that Richthofen learnt of the
<b>Floyd</b> | rumour that he (the ace in the red plane) was a woman.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And yet, despite the common depiction of WWI fighter aces as being the

<b>Floyd</b> | knights of the air, their affinity for one another was probably most
<b>Floyd</b> | inspired by a common understanding of the brutality of their conflict.
<b>Floyd</b> | Pilots were given almost no training.  New members of the Royal Flying
<b>Floyd</b> | Corps were called 'twenty minuters' with respect to their expected
<b>Floyd</b> | lifespan.  Senseless waste of lives was as common in the air as in the
<b>Floyd</b> | trenches.  Unlike in the world of Snowblind Aces, pilots were never

<b>Floyd</b> | issued parachutes - it was considered that this would merely enable
<b>Floyd</b> | cowardice.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lucas Thane, depending on how you play him, is a mixture of two of the
<b>Floyd</b> | top three French aces.  Charles Nungesser was the quintessential
<b>Floyd</b> | daredevil ace, who would crawl into his plane after a night out

<b>Floyd</b> | drinking and partying, perform death defying stunts, crash, break all
<b>Floyd</b> | his bones, and still crawl into the plane again the next day.  After
<b>Floyd</b> | the war, he continued to risk his life in the air, and disappeared
<b>Floyd</b> | during an attempted transatlantic crossing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Georges Guynemer, on the other hand, managed to become a pilot inspite

<b>Floyd</b> | of his youth and ill health.  He was relatively shy and unassuming,
<b>Floyd</b> | prone to truly anachronistic acts of chivalry towards the enemy.  As
<b>Floyd</b> | the war dragged on, Guynemer's physical and mental health began to
<b>Floyd</b> | deteriorate.  A national hero, Guynemer was expected by his superiors
<b>Floyd</b> | and the public to continue to risk his life in combat.  He refused to
<b>Floyd</b> | retire, afraid of what would be said of him, and was eventually

<b>Floyd</b> | presumed killed in an ambush one overcast morning - though his body was
<b>Floyd</b> | never found.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Despite Imelda's insistence to the contrary, the triplane was - in our
<b>Floyd</b> | universe, anyway - by and large a failed experiment.  The British
<b>Floyd</b> | Sopwith Triplane and German Fokker Dr1. were both hugely successful,

<b>Floyd</b> | living up to the intended 'increased maneuvrability, reduced speed' of
<b>Floyd</b> | the design, but a plethora of other triplanes have justifiably
<b>Floyd</b> | disappeared into the mists of history, remembered only as peculiar
<b>Floyd</b> | mutants.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As a final note, if you find yourself in the Northern Territories these

<b>Floyd</b> | days and are attacked by a feral icekin, please remember that they are
<b>Floyd</b> | endangered, so you should probably let it eat you.
