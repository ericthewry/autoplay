						<strong><em>Bonehead</em> by Sean M. Shore</strong>

						<span class="fontish smallest">As played on ifMUD on February 19, 2012</span>

					<p class="leftalign">
					<span class="fontish smaller">The idea behind ClubFloyd
						is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of 
						people meet online to cooperatively play a game of 
						interactive fiction.<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of <em>Bonehead</em>, written
						by Sean M. Shore. Bonehead was originally released as part of Spring Thing 2011, where it took second place.  It went on to be a finalist for Best Story in the 2011 Xyzzy Awards. 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting

					<br>
					
						
					
					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing this game, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played this game, and think you might like to at some
						point, I do not recommend reading any further. Instead,
						you might want to return to the <a class="decorate" href=

<b>Floyd</b> | It's a chilly September morning in lower Manhattan.  You're on your way

<b>Floyd</b> | Bonehead is the mostly true story of Fred Merkle, major league baseball
<b>Floyd</b> | player for the New York Giants, and the mistake he made as a teenager
<b>Floyd</b> | that haunted him for the rest of his life.  There are some puzzles, but
<b>Floyd</b> | the primary emphasis is on setting and story.  Poking around is
<b>Floyd</b> | strongly encouraged.  Although it is possible to put the game in an
<b>Floyd</b> | unwinnable state, it will become painfully obvious within two or three
<b>Floyd</b> | moves that this has happened.  With a few UNDOs, you should always be
<b>Floyd</b> | able to get to a final (if not exactly winning) ending.  Needless to
<b>Floyd</b> | say, saving the game from time to time, especially once you're at the
<b>Floyd</b> | ballpark, is recommended.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The game features a great deal of baseball-related activity and
<b>Floyd</b> | language, some of it antiquated.  If you are unfamiliar with baseball,
<b>Floyd</b> | you will doubtless be somewhat confused at times, but I have tried to
<b>Floyd</b> | make the game as forgiving to novices as possible.  See Baseball in
<b>Floyd</b> | Three Paragraphs in this menu for some basic information on the sport.
<b>Floyd</b> | Also, be sure to talk to everyone you can talk to, especially a certain
<b>Floyd</b> | right fielder on your team, and you will eventually learn what a
<b>Floyd</b> | ballplayer needs to know.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Normal movement using compass directions is supplemented with GO TO
<b>Floyd</b> | &lt;location&gt;.  You may find this handy when moving around the diamond.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Conversation is handled using Eric Eve's terrific Conversation
<b>Floyd</b> | Framework and Conversation Suggestions.  To initiate a conversation
<b>Floyd</b> | with a character, you can TALK TO the character, or SAY HELLO TO him,
<b>Floyd</b> | or ASK him ABOUT or TELL him ABOUT something.  Use TOPICS to display
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation topics.  Occasionally a character might respond to
<b>Floyd</b> | something not in his topics list.  You may also be able to REMEMBER
<b>Floyd</b> | advice that other characters have given you previously.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | From time to time the game will display images at the top of the
<b>Floyd</b> | screen.  Having a reasonably large window size may be helpful.  Note
<b>Floyd</b> | that these images are not in any way critical to game play, so
<b>Floyd</b> | sight-impaired players will not be at a disadvantage.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Please send any comments, suggestions, and especially bug reports to
<b>Floyd</b> | mister_patient@yahoo.com.  Thanks for playing.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Baseball is a pretty complicated game with many arcane rules -- I doubt
<b>Floyd</b> | very many fans can explain the myriad ways in which a pitcher can
<b>Floyd</b> | commit a balk (I can't) -- but for purposes of Bonehead, you only need
<b>Floyd</b> | to know a very few things.  These can be learned by careful reading or
<b>Floyd</b> | trial and error during play, but the information below may be helpful
<b>Floyd</b> | for those unfamiliar with the game.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You are a batter, a runner, and a fielder in this game.  As a batter,
<b>Floyd</b> | you stand at home plate, attempting to hit balls thrown by the pitcher
<b>Floyd</b> | by swinging a bat.  (The mechanics of swinging will be explained to you
<b>Floyd</b> | in-game; please make sure to talk to your teammates about the art of
<b>Floyd</b> | hitting).  During batting practice, the pitcher throws balls for you to
<b>Floyd</b> | hit easily.  In the "real" game, however, the pitcher is your opponent;
<b>Floyd</b> | he attempts to keep you from hitting the ball, or hitting it well.  If
<b>Floyd</b> | you swing and miss at a pitch, it is recorded as a strike against you.
<b>Floyd</b> | If you decline to swing at a pitch, but the umpire deems it to be
<b>Floyd</b> | within the strike zone (roughly, from your chest to your knees
<b>Floyd</b> | vertically, and the width of the plate horizontally), it is also
<b>Floyd</b> | recorded as a strike.  Three strikes, and you are out.  If the pitch is
<b>Floyd</b> | outside the strike zone, it is recorded as a ball.  Four balls, and you
<b>Floyd</b> | are granted first base automatically (a base on balls, or a walk).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you hit the ball in fair territory during the game, you must run to
<b>Floyd</b> | first base; and from there, possibly to second base, third base, and
<b>Floyd</b> | back to home plate, which scores a run for your team.  The team with
<b>Floyd</b> | the most runs at the end of the game is the winner.  Note that the
<b>Floyd</b> | batter is required to try to advance to first base if he hits the ball
<b>Floyd</b> | and it is not caught in the air by a fielder.  If there is already a
<b>Floyd</b> | runner at first base, that runner must try to advance to second base.
<b>Floyd</b> | If the ball arrives at second base before that runner does, the runner
<b>Floyd</b> | is forced out.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As a fielder, you are on defense: your goal is to put out the opposing
<b>Floyd</b> | players.  One of the primary means of accomplishing this is to touch
<b>Floyd</b> | first base while in possession of the baseball, before the batter can
<b>Floyd</b> | reach the base himself.  In Bonehead, you are a first baseman, so this
<b>Floyd</b> | task mostly falls to you.  On a ground ball, the other fielders will
<b>Floyd</b> | throw the ball to you; it's your job to catch it and make sure you're
<b>Floyd</b> | touching first when it arrives.  Of course, it's not always possible to
<b>Floyd</b> | do both at the same time.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For a more complete explanation, clearer than anything I could have
<b>Floyd</b> | written, please see
<b>Floyd</b> | [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball#Rules_and_gameplay.">LINK</A>]  Even better:
<b>Floyd</b> | watch a game.

<b>Floyd</b> | Ethel to become an anonymous citrus grower.  But you still love the
<b>Floyd</b> | game, even if it made you a national laughingstock, so you reluctantly
<b>Floyd</b> | agree to manage the local minor-league club.  It doesn't last long.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I don't need Fred Merkle the Bonehead to teach me how to pitch!",
<b>Floyd</b> | yells your own pitcher, when you lift him after a mediocre outing.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | words reverberate around the sparsely-attended park.  The guy in the
<b>Floyd</b> | back row must have heard it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's about the millionth time someone has called you a bonehead in the
<b>Floyd</b> | last twenty years.  You'd think by now that either they'd be tired of
<b>Floyd</b> | it, or that you'd be used to it.  Somehow, neither has happened.
<b>Floyd</b> | Wherever you go, whatever you do, it is always with you.  In the
<b>Floyd</b> | Baseball Encyclopedia, Ty Cobb's entry lists his nickname as "The
<b>Floyd</b> | Georgia Peach."  Walter Johnson's says "The Big Train."  Care to guess
<b>Floyd</b> | what yours says, Fred?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You quit your job as manager after the game.

<b>Floyd</b> | September 23, 1908.  After your commute on the IRT, you arrive at your
<b>Floyd</b> | workplace: the Polo Grounds.  They don't actually play polo here; they
<b>Floyd</b> | did in the original Polo Grounds, where the Giants also played, but
<b>Floyd</b> | this is a new park in a different location.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's a couple of hours before game time.  You've put on your uniform
<b>Floyd</b> | and you're warming up with the other fellows in preparation for sitting
<b>Floyd</b> | on the bench as usual.  The team is taking batting practice, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | small group is at the plate.  Roger Bresnahan, the Giants' veteran
<b>Floyd</b> | catcher, is taking his swings right now.  Turkey Mike Donlin and
<b>Floyd</b> | Christy Mathewson wait here for their turns.  Joe McGinnity is throwing
<b>Floyd</b> | from the pitcher's mound sixty feet away, and Fred Snodgrass is acting
<b>Floyd</b> | as catcher.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The first baseman, Fred Tenney, comes limping up to you, clutching his
<b>Floyd</b> | back.  "Merkle, McGraw wants a word with you," he says, pointing to the
<b>Floyd</b> | Giants' dugout to the south.  Tenney slowly shuffles off the field.

<b>Floyd</b> | Home Plate
<b>Floyd</b> | This is home plate in your home park.  During the game, there will be
<b>Floyd</b> | fewer people loitering here, and somewhat less chit-chat.  A temporary
<b>Floyd</b> | backstop has been wheeled in for batting practice.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The whole lovely ballpark stretches out before you, invitingly.  Your
<b>Floyd</b> | dugout is to the south, first base is southeast, the pitcher's mound is
<b>Floyd</b> | to the east, third base is northeast, and the visiting dugout is to the
<b>Floyd</b> | north.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (You might be curious about these directions.  In the Polo Grounds, as
<b>Floyd</b> | in many other parks, the left field foul pole is roughly due north.
<b>Floyd</b> | This means that a pitcher standing on the mound facing the plate has
<b>Floyd</b> | his left shoulder facing south.  This is why lefties are called
<b>Floyd</b> | southpaws.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Matty and Donlin lean up against the backstop, chatting, while
<b>Floyd</b> | Bresnahan takes batting practice and Snodgrass catches anything
<b>Floyd</b> | Bresnahan doesn't offer at.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | McGinnity deals, and Bresnahan laces a solid line drive.

<b>Floyd</b> | Leaning against the backstop is a bat.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Say, Mike, how do you approach an at bat against a tough pitcher?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, kid, the way I see it, hitting is all about two things: pitch
<b>Floyd</b> | recognition and timing.  You have to be able to identify a pitch right
<b>Floyd</b> | out of the pitcher's hand, whether it's a fastball or a curve or a
<b>Floyd</b> | change or a spitball or something else.  You have to get good at
<b>Floyd</b> | anticipating where it's headed, too.  Pitchers are going to want you to
<b>Floyd</b> | chase their pitch out of the strike zone; you have to make them throw
<b>Floyd</b> | you your pitch.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And then there's timing.  Pitchers are trying to foul up your timing,
<b>Floyd</b> | keep you off-balance, so they will vary the speed of their pitches.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If it's a fastball, it's coming hard; you'll need to start your swing
<b>Floyd</b> | early.  For a fastball on the inside part of the plate, SWING EARLY TO
<b>Floyd</b> | PULL.  For an outside fastball, SWING EARLY TO THE OPPOSITE FIELD.  If
<b>Floyd</b> | they throw you something off-speed, like a changeup or a curve, it's
<b>Floyd</b> | going to be deceptively slow; you want to keep your hands back and
<b>Floyd</b> | swing late.  If it's inside, SWING LATE TO PULL, and if it's outside,
<b>Floyd</b> | SWING LATE TO THE OPPOSITE FIELD.  Of course, if it's out of the strike
<b>Floyd</b> | zone, you don't want to swing at all."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You could ask him about batting practice, Pfiester, pitch recognition,

<b>Floyd</b> | "The first thing to identify is the spin.  A ball with backspin is

<b>Floyd</b> | going to be a curveball.  A ball with no spin is a knuckleball, but
<b>Floyd</b> | Pfiester doesn't throw one, so you don't have to worry about that.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You also want to get a look at the pitcher's grip if you can.  If the
<b>Floyd</b> | pitcher's any good, his motion with the fastball and change is going to
<b>Floyd</b> | look exactly the same, so you don't know which is which.  One way to
<b>Floyd</b> | tell is to get a look at his pitching hand when he's in his windup or
<b>Floyd</b> | in the set position.  If he's got two fingers spread out on top, and
<b>Floyd</b> | the thumb underneath, that's a fastball.  If there's three fingers on
<b>Floyd</b> | top, it means he's gripping it more tightly to slow it down.  It's a

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A Sunday morning in church, circa 1936.  People are milling around
<b>Floyd</b> | before the start of the service.  They're your neighbors, for the most
<b>Floyd</b> | part.  They know to tread lightly around certain subjects.  Some other
<b>Floyd</b> | folks within earshot, not so much.  They're busy chattering away about
<b>Floyd</b> | the pennant races.  You try to shut them out, but it's impossible.  You
<b>Floyd</b> | can't not hear them.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The reverend isn't here today; looks like they've got a visiting
<b>Floyd</b> | minister in.  He steps up to the pulpit, maybe a little nervous, clears
<b>Floyd</b> | his throat.  The crowd take their seats and wait expectantly.  "I want
<b>Floyd</b> | to begin," he says, forcing the sort of smile that accompanies a weak
<b>Floyd</b> | joke, "by admitting to you an ugly secret.  I am from Toledo, Ohio;
<b>Floyd</b> | birthplace of the infamous Fred 'Bonehead' Merkle!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A few of the other parishioners gasp, and you can feel their eyes on
<b>Floyd</b> | you.  Ethel squeezes your hand.  Well, that's just splendid.  It's one
<b>Floyd</b> | thing to hear it when you're umpiring an exhibition game  -- as
<b>Floyd</b> | happened a couple of years ago, the last time you tried to set foot on
<b>Floyd</b> | a major league diamond.  But now you can't even come to church anymore.
<b>Floyd</b> | You gather up Ethel and the kids and quietly walk out.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The final indignity: you weren't even born in Toledo.

<b>Floyd</b> | The stands are packed with 20,000 cranks as the battle for the National
<b>Floyd</b> | League pennant begins.  The game is a very tight affair.  For the first
<b>Floyd</b> | four innings, Matty and Pfiester throw zeroes up on the board.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | Cubs' defense is a little shaky, but the Gothams cannot capitalize.
<b>Floyd</b> | You help out with a nice grab on Joe Tinker's line drive in the 2nd,
<b>Floyd</b> | but up until the final frame, you do very little with the stick --
<b>Floyd</b> | you're 0 for 2 with a walk.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the fifth, the Cubs strike.  It's Tinker -- Matty's nemesis.  He
<b>Floyd</b> | drives a ball to right that skips past Donlin.  While Turkey Mike
<b>Floyd</b> | scrambles to retrieve it, Tinker circles the bases for a home run.
<b>Floyd</b> | Cubs 1, Giants 0.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the sixth, Donlin gets his revenge by driving in Buck Herzog with
<b>Floyd</b> | the tying run.  Cubs 1, Giants 1.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The pitchers' duel continues for another inning.  Now it's the top of
<b>Floyd</b> | the eighth.  You and the other Giants are out in the field, playing
<b>Floyd</b> | defense.  Johnny Kling, the Cubs' catcher, leads off for Chicago.
<b>Floyd</b> | There'll be a chance to avoid your fate here, if you so choose.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | First Base
<b>Floyd</b> | You stand a few steps behind and to the right of first base, wearing
<b>Floyd</b> | your glove, and ready to field your position should the ball come your
<b>Floyd</b> | way.  Matty is on the mound, looking in at Bresnahan behind the plate.
<b>Floyd</b> | To your right is Buck Herzog, the second baseman.  The cranks along the
<b>Floyd</b> | first base line are almost close enough to touch.  They're certainly
<b>Floyd</b> | close enough to hear.  Most are shouting encouragement; a few, perhaps
<b>Floyd</b> | drunk, are heckling.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Pitcher's Mound
<b>Floyd</b> | This is the pitcher's mound.  It rises to a height of about fifteen
<b>Floyd</b> | inches to give the pitcher a better angle from which to throw.  In the
<b>Floyd</b> | old days, the hurler had a chalk-outlined box on level ground, and
<b>Floyd</b> | could throw the ball from anywhere inside that area.  (Thus the
<b>Floyd</b> | expression, "knocked out of the box", when a pitcher is hit hard by the
<b>Floyd</b> | opposing team.)  Nowadays the pitcher must throw from the pitching
<b>Floyd</b> | rubber.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Home plate is west; second base is east; first base is south; and third
<b>Floyd</b> | base is north.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see a rosin bag here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Bresnahan wraps things up.  "OK, everyone know what they're doing?"
<b>Floyd</b> | The other fellows all nod their assent.  Bresnahan heads back behind
<b>Floyd</b> | the plate, and Matty gives you a quick wink.  The other infielders,
<b>Floyd</b> | including you, move back to their original positions.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | First Base
<b>Floyd</b> | You stand a few steps behind and to the right of first base, wearing
<b>Floyd</b> | your glove, and ready to field your position should the ball come your
<b>Floyd</b> | way.  Matty is on the mound, looking in at Bresnahan behind the plate.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Johnny Kling is here, taking a short lead off first base.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Matty steps on the rubber.  He looks in at Bresnahan, who flashes the
<b>Floyd</b> | signs.  Matty nods, and sets.  He gives a quick look back at Kling, to
<b>Floyd</b> | make sure he's not taking a big lead.  Then he begins his windup.
<b>Floyd</b> | Pfiester starts to square around to bunt, holding his bat right out in
<b>Floyd</b> | front of him to deaden the ball.

<b>Floyd</b> | Across the diamond, Devlin creeps up towards home plate.  Herzog

<b>Floyd</b> | Can't you follow instructions, Merkle?  Well, it's too late now.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Matty sets and delivers.  The pitch rides up high and tight to
<b>Floyd</b> | Pfiester.  There's nothing he can do with that pitch, but he tries to
<b>Floyd</b> | bunt anyway.  The result is a two-hopper, straight to Matty.  Looks
<b>Floyd</b> | like you've covering first base after all.  Kling takes off for second,
<b>Floyd</b> | and Pfiester heads to first, disgusted.  Instead of a sacrifice bunt,
<b>Floyd</b> | it's looking like a double play.  The cranks along the sidelines are
<b>Floyd</b> | screaming "Two!  Two!".
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Matty wheels around 180 degrees just as Bridwell reaches the bag.  He
<b>Floyd</b> | fires.  Bridwell takes the throw and sweeps his foot across the bag,
<b>Floyd</b> | just as Kling comes bearing down on him.  One out.  He steps to the

<b>Floyd</b> | Weren't you listening to Bresnahan?  You need to field your position,
<b>Floyd</b> | which is first base.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | First Base
<b>Floyd</b> | You stand a few steps behind and to the right of first base, wearing
<b>Floyd</b> | your glove, and ready to field your position should the ball come your
<b>Floyd</b> | way.  Matty is on the mound, looking in at Bresnahan behind the plate.
<b>Floyd</b> | To your right is Buck Herzog, the second baseman.  The cranks along the
<b>Floyd</b> | first base line are almost close enough to touch.  They're certainly
<b>Floyd</b> | close enough to hear.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Johnny Kling is here, taking a short lead off first base.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Across the diamond, Devlin creeps up towards home plate.  Herzog
<b>Floyd</b> | notices you not doing the same.  He flashes you a look as if to say,
<b>Floyd</b> | Can't you follow instructions, Merkle?  Well, it's too late now.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Matty sets and delivers.  The pitch rides up high and tight to
<b>Floyd</b> | Pfiester.  There's nothing he can do with that pitch, but he tries to
<b>Floyd</b> | bunt anyway.  The result is a two-hopper, straight to Matty.  Looks
<b>Floyd</b> | like you've covering first base after all.  Kling takes off for second,
<b>Floyd</b> | and Pfiester heads to first, disgusted.  Instead of a sacrifice bunt,
<b>Floyd</b> | it's looking like a double play.  The cranks along the sidelines are
<b>Floyd</b> | screaming "Two!  Two!".
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Matty wheels around 180 degrees just as Bridwell reaches the bag.  He
<b>Floyd</b> | fires.  Bridwell takes the throw and sweeps his foot across the bag,
<b>Floyd</b> | just as Kling comes bearing down on him.  One out.  He steps to the
<b>Floyd</b> | outfield side of the bag, and gets set to throw the ball to you, to
<b>Floyd</b> | complete the double play.

<b>Floyd</b> | Matty sets and delivers.  The pitch rides up high and tight to
<b>Floyd</b> | Pfiester.  There's nothing he can do with that pitch, but he tries to
<b>Floyd</b> | bunt anyway.  The result is a two-hopper, straight to Matty.  Looks
<b>Floyd</b> | like you've covering first base after all.  Kling takes off for second,
<b>Floyd</b> | and Pfiester heads to first, disgusted.  Instead of a sacrifice bunt,
<b>Floyd</b> | it's looking like a double play.  The cranks along the sidelines are
<b>Floyd</b> | screaming "Two!  Two!".
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Matty wheels around 180 degrees just as Bridwell reaches the bag.  He
<b>Floyd</b> | fires.  Bridwell takes the throw and sweeps his foot across the bag,
<b>Floyd</b> | just as Kling comes bearing down on him.  One out.  He steps to the
<b>Floyd</b> | outfield side of the bag, and gets set to throw the ball to you, to
<b>Floyd</b> | complete the double play.

<b>Floyd</b> | What happens next is a matter of some dispute.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In one account, Johnny Evers turns and yells to Solly Hofman, the
<b>Floyd</b> | center fielder.  Merkle hasn't touched second base.  The force play is
<b>Floyd</b> | still in effect.  Hofman finds the ball, throws it back in toward
<b>Floyd</b> | Evers, but Joe McGinnity, who had been coaching third, intercepts it,
<b>Floyd</b> | and throws the ball away into the crowd somewhere.  In the meantime,
<b>Floyd</b> | Evers gets the attention of O'Day, and somehow finds a ball.  Almost
<b>Floyd</b> | certainly not the ball Bridwell hit.  Just a ball.  He steps on second,
<b>Floyd</b> | and O'Day raises his right fist.  Three outs, and McCormick's run
<b>Floyd</b> | doesn't count.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In some retellings, McGinnity doesn't intercept anything.  And Bridwell
<b>Floyd</b> | and Snodgrass both later say that Evers never had any ball at all, and
<b>Floyd</b> | that Chance just argued the point with O'Day.  What isn't in dispute is
<b>Floyd</b> | that you never touched second base, and thus McCormick never scored.
<b>Floyd</b> | It so happens that a few weeks earlier in Pittsburgh, a similar thing
<b>Floyd</b> | happened, and Evers tried to get O'Day, who was umpiring that game as
<b>Floyd</b> | well, to rule the player out.  He didn't, but Evers was determined to
<b>Floyd</b> | press his claim if it were to ever happen again.  And this time, he
<b>Floyd</b> | succeeded.

<b>Floyd</b> | Cy Seymour drops an easy fly ball, and Brown is brilliant.  Chicago 4,

<b>Floyd</b> | No one on the Giants blames you.  "Being held close to the bag, the
<b>Floyd</b> | crowd rushing on him before he'd made it to second, seeing the winning
<b>Floyd</b> | run already cross the plate, why I think anyone would have done the
<b>Floyd</b> | same thing that Fred Merkle did," says Al Bridwell, many years later.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It is very unfair to put all the blame on Merkle for our losing the
<b>Floyd</b> | pennant in 1908," said Fred Snodgrass.  "McGraw never did, and neither
<b>Floyd</b> | did the rest of us.  It was mostly the newspapers.  They were the ones
<b>Floyd</b> | who invented the term 'bonehead.'  How could you blame Merkle, when we
<b>Floyd</b> | lost the play-off game and besides that we lost five other games after
<b>Floyd</b> | the Merkle incident?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Mr. McGraw is always your stalwart defender, and for years, turns to
<b>Floyd</b> | you for advice in tough spots.  But as far as the rest of the world is
<b>Floyd</b> | concerned, you are Fred Merkle, bonehead.

<b>Floyd</b> | July 30, 1950, the Polo Grounds.  It's not the same Polo Grounds.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | old wood park burned down in 1911.  The new one is on the same patch of
<b>Floyd</b> | ground.  You played here too for several years.  It's undergone some
<b>Floyd</b> | renovations since -- most notably, to enclose the whole outfield -- but
<b>Floyd</b> | it still feels like home.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's Old Timers' Day.  To your children's amazement, you accepted the
<b>Floyd</b> | Giants' invitation to come back.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | New Giants' Dugout
<b>Floyd</b> | You're in the dugout, mingling with some of the current ballplayers.
<b>Floyd</b> | There's Sal Maglie, the Barber -- so named because he pitches so high
<b>Floyd</b> | and tight that he shaves the hitters' stubble.  There's Alvin Dark, the
<b>Floyd</b> | terrific young shortstop.  Over in the corner is Bobby Thomson.  He'll
<b>Floyd</b> | have a big moment soon enough.  And you've just greeted the manager,
<b>Floyd</b> | Leo Durocher, famous for coining the phrase, "Nice guys finish last."
<b>Floyd</b> | He didn't say that exactly, but that's how people remember it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The public address announcer gets the attention of the crowd: "Our next
<b>Floyd</b> | returning player manned first base for the Giants from 1907 to 1915,
<b>Floyd</b> | appearing on three pennant-winning clubs.  A great fielder, a great
<b>Floyd</b> | hitter, and a leader on and off the field -- please welcome: Fred
<b>Floyd</b> | Merkle!"
