The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Galatea</i>, written by Emily Short.  <I>Galatea</I> was originally released as part of the 2000 IF Art Show, where it took Best of Show.  It went on to be nominated for three Xyzzy Awards, including Best Game and Best NPCs, ultimately winning the Xyzzy for Best Individual NPC.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Galatea'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>
