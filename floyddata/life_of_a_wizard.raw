<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | Wizards.  From the kindly old white bearded casters wearing robes with
<b>Floyd</b> | stars and moons to the battle-hardened war-mage throwing fireballs at
<b>Floyd</b> | dragons.  The royal family has always had one on hand: a wise diviner
<b>Floyd</b> | to lead the kingdom into peace or a dangerous conjurer to dominate all
<b>Floyd</b> | of the land under one rule.  Or perhaps a divine healer?  An
<b>Floyd</b> | alchemist?  Or even a necromancer?  The combinations are boundless.
<b>Floyd</b> | Let me tell you my story.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I wasn't always a wizened old wizard, you know.  Wizards begin their
<b>Floyd</b> | lives the same as everyone else.  I was born in a small village in the
<b>Floyd</b> | Kingdom of Daria.  King Norbert and Queen Audrey reigned in the
<b>Floyd</b> | capital city of Tornassa, which was many miles away from my small
<b>Floyd</b> | village.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I remember the day I was born.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: My parents were good people.
<b>Floyd</b> | B: My parents didn't want me.

<b>Floyd</b> | kingdom was very racially tolerant, when I was young.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My parents weren't poor, although they never bothered to make sure
<b>Floyd</b> | that my clothes were without holes or that my shoes fit.  They fought
<b>Floyd</b> | a lot and my father was often drunk.  They never hit me, but I think
<b>Floyd</b> | it was because they knew that the temple priests would never allow
<b>Floyd</b> | such a thing.  I always had the impression that they were waiting for
<b>Floyd</b> | me to become old enough to move out.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Even as a young child, I was drawn into the unknown.  I remember my

<b>Floyd</b> | more difficult than I had thought. I knew that I'd need a fighter, a
<b>Floyd</b> | thief and a cleric.  A strong fighter would keep the enemies away
<b>Floyd</b> | while I cast my magic, a dexterous thief would open locks and find
<b>Floyd</b> | traps, and a wise cleric would heal us all when trouble occurred.
<b>Floyd</b> | Even though I could do a little of each job, I knew that it was
<b>Floyd</b> | important to have specialists so that I could concentrate on my magic.
<b>Floyd</b> | After nearly a year of searching, I came upon the solution, I would
<b>Floyd</b> | form the party myself.  I rented a room at the Full Cup Inn in
<b>Floyd</b> | Tornassa and began to accept applicants. Generic Love Interest moved
<b>Floyd</b> | in with me and the innkeeper was nice enough to let us stay for free,
<b>Floyd</b> | provided that I promised to help with security or any other troubles
<b>Floyd</b> | that routinely cropped up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | First, I had to hire someone for the fighter position:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: I considered my friend from the academy, Tessa, for the fighter
<b>Floyd</b> | position.
<b>Floyd</b> | B: I considered Generic Love Interest, my girlfriend, for the fighter
<b>Floyd</b> | position.

<b>Floyd</b> | position. (Needs to have graduated and 25 gold)
<b>Floyd</b> | D: I considered Stewart, a man who applied for the job, for the
<b>Floyd</b> | fighter position.

<b>Floyd</b> | My party and I packed our bags and left my small village.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I was 32 years old when the great dragon Parnaxxus renewed his
<b>Floyd</b> | terrible wrath upon the land.  King Gareth's reign was tearing the
<b>Floyd</b> | kingdom apart and the dragon was decimating what was left.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | Fighters Guild did very well through these years, gaining many
<b>Floyd</b> | contracts to defend villagers and merchants from the mighty beast.
<b>Floyd</b> | Grom, a dues paying member of the guild, was approached by the guild
<b>Floyd</b> | leader for a lucrative contract. Our fighter wasn't hired away from
<b>Floyd</b> | our party, instead, the entire party was offered a job.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The guild hall in Tornassa had grown rich from the fear Parnaxxus was
<b>Floyd</b> | instilling in the land, even though the fighters who were hired out
<b>Floyd</b> | could do little against the mighty beast.  The guild leader brought
<b>Floyd</b> | the entire party into his office and told us what he needed.  A mighty
<b>Floyd</b> | wizard had hired the Fighters Guild to protect him against Parnaxxus.
<b>Floyd</b> | The guild sent a dozen fighters, but when the dragon attacked his
<b>Floyd</b> | tower, all twelve fighters were killed and the tower was laid to
<b>Floyd</b> | waste.  The contract was fulfilled, the fighters had fought to the
<b>Floyd</b> | best of their abilities, but the mage refused to pay.  The Mage Guild
<b>Floyd</b> | refused to get involved. We were to speak to the mage and get the 1000
<b>Floyd</b> | gold that was owed to the Fighters Guild.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We looked over our equipment and trained our skills before we left.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: Equip Grom, the fighter.
<b>Floyd</b> | B: Equip Kal, the thief.

<b>Floyd</b> | I remember the historical day when the entire Kingdom shook from an
<b>Floyd</b> | enormous earthquake, even though it wasn't until weeks later that the
<b>Floyd</b> | results were known.  A small village named Scone, in southern Daria,
<b>Floyd</b> | had suddenly started being attacked from within.  Their temple had
<b>Floyd</b> | begun to spew forth all manner of foul beasts. Many adventuring
<b>Floyd</b> | parties took it upon themselves to investigate the tunnels below.
<b>Floyd</b> | This vast dungeon soon became known as the Abyss.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We didn't try our luck until nearly halfway into our adventuring
<b>Floyd</b> | career, many years after the monsters had appeared.  We didn't want to
<b>Floyd</b> | be just another party of adventurers defeated deep beneath the ground.
<b>Floyd</b> | We decided that the time was right for our party to test its skills
<b>Floyd</b> | against the great dungeon.  The only other challenge that took every
<b>Floyd</b> | member of my party's skill into account was when we met Parnaxxus, but
<b>Floyd</b> | that didn't happen until much later.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Twilight Sparkle, my warhorse was happy to be moving, so were the
<b>Floyd</b> | other mounts that the rest of my party were riding. It was a nice ride
<b>Floyd</b> | as we traveled to the small village of Scone.
<b>Floyd</b> | (Geography +3)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The village of Scone had made the best of a bad situation.  Over the
<b>Floyd</b> | years, they had built a thriving community around the Abyss.
<b>Floyd</b> | Weaponsmiths, inns, taverns and general stores catered to the
<b>Floyd</b> | adventurers.  They purchased the loot that came from the dungeon and
<b>Floyd</b> | sold new equipment to parties who needed things.

<b>Floyd</b> | Travis and his family were safe.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Kingdom of Daria was in a terrible mess as everything seemed to be

<b>Floyd</b> | major offensive upon seeing that Daria was so weak.  The white bearded
<b>Floyd</b> | wizard, Fraledan himself, came to me requesting help.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It's good to see you again, Morgana," he said, treating me like an

<b>Floyd</b> | companions to bring a treaty to the Orc Chieftain.  It has many
<b>Floyd</b> | concessions in it, but it's fair and it should stop the orcs from

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It was a sad time for the kingdom of Daria, but we really had no

<b>Floyd</b> | (Geography +3)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We left the Kingdom of Daria behind as we traveled toward the west and
<b>Floyd</b> | into orc territory, I was very excited to see my ancestral home.  Even
<b>Floyd</b> | though half-orcs were shunned by pure orcs, it would still be good to
<b>Floyd</b> | see where I had come from.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | We were deep into the wilderness when we stumbled upon something
<b>Floyd</b> | entirely different.  The trees had become older and older with each
<b>Floyd</b> | step and the forest was teeming with wildlife.  We were far from the
<b>Floyd</b> | orc homeland still, but as we passed through a circle of mushrooms, we
<b>Floyd</b> | began to see strange things.  Little people, similar to elves but much
<b>Floyd</b> | smaller, danced all around us. One of them came forward and asked for
<b>Floyd</b> | aid.  She wore a tiny little dress and her diminutive shoes were
<b>Floyd</b> | pointed.  She said that a 'monster' had attacked their forest home.
<b>Floyd</b> | We went to check it out.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The creature was enormous, larger than any boar I'd ever heard of.  It
<b>Floyd</b> | looked badly diseased, its eyes were bleeding and its fur was all
<b>Floyd</b> | matted with filth.  I would have guessed that it was undead, a zombie
<b>Floyd</b> | of some type, but my arcane skills told me that no Necromancy was
<b>Floyd</b> | involved.  It was corrupted and far from natural, my best guess was
<b>Floyd</b> | that it was the result of some magical experiment.  The moment it saw
<b>Floyd</b> | us, it charged.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: Grom defended us well. (Needs Fighter Power 6)
<b>Floyd</b> | B: I shot a spark of fire toward the creature. (Needs 45 Conjuration)
