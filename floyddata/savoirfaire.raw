						The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each
						week at a pre-arranged time, a group of
						people meet online to cooperatively play
						a game of interactive fiction.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Savoir-Faire</em> written by Emily Short.
						It was nominated for eight Xyzzy Awards and won four of those. It also placed eight in the 2011 edition of the Interactive Fiction Top 50 of all time. 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The beautiful life is always damned, they say. As for you, you've
<b>Floyd</b> | overexpended yourself: fifteen years of prominence, champagne,
<b>Floyd</b> | carriage rides in the Tuileries, having your name whispered behind
<b>Floyd</b> | manicured hands, getting elegant ladies out of elegant fixes -- and
<b>Floyd</b> | you're <span class="floydstyle em">in debt</span>. Bound by oath and honor to a pack of
<b>Floyd</b> | scoundrels. Your father, old peasant that he was, could have warned
<b>Floyd</b> | you against their type.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You'd hoped to find the Count at home; your original plan was to ask
<b>Floyd</b> | him for an advance on the money you expect to earn on your estate in a
<b>Floyd</b> | month or two. But according to the local population, the Count hasn't
<b>Floyd</b> | been home in months, and Marie, who was in residence until recently,
<b>Floyd</b> | has vanished as well. "No one around the big house now," says one of
<b>Floyd</b> | the peasant women tersely. "Even turned off the cook, they did."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But you need the money at once; if you return to Paris without it,
<b>Floyd</b> | your creditors are unlikely to be forgiving. So you walked over the
<b>Floyd</b> | fields anyway, and got in through the gap in the kitchen garden wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | You will just have to find what you can.

</b><b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">About This Game:</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This is version 7 of Savoir-Faire, which was first released in April
<b>Floyd</b> | of 2002. It received four XYZZY Awards (Best Player Character, Best
<b>Floyd</b> | Story, Best Puzzles, and Best Game) for that year.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The game was designed to be an old-fashioned puzzle game -- that is to
<b>Floyd</b> | say, lots of emphasis on difficult problems, light on story-line and
<b>Floyd</b> | character interaction. Some of the puzzles are fairly challenging, and
<b>Floyd</b> | it is possible to get the game into a state from which it cannot be
<b>Floyd</b> | won. Save often.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Historicity:</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Savoir-Faire is set in an alternate, somewhat mangled version of the
<b>Floyd</b> | early 1780s. Vagueness about setting, and a tendency towards
<b>Floyd</b> | anachronism, were traits I associate with old-style games, and they
<b>Floyd</b> | are present to some degree here. All the same, I've received the
<b>Floyd</b> | occasional complaint about historical inaccuracy, to which I can only
<b>Floyd</b> | reply that SF was never intended to be terribly accurate, and if
<b>Floyd</b> | you're reading it that way, you're missing the point (and would be
<b>Floyd</b> | better off playing Peter Nepstad's meticulously researched "1893").
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Background Materials:</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As of the release of this version, it is still possible to get copies
<b>Floyd</b> | of the "feelies" I created to go with it. These include a booklet of
<b>Floyd</b> | background material about the alternate history of this world, and
<b>Floyd</b> | some more information about the fate of the characters in it. If
<b>Floyd</b> | interested, you may check out [<a href="http://www.feelies.org/">LINK</A>] to determine
<b>Floyd</b> | whether they are still available.

</b><b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | These general instructions are adapted from: "A Beginner's Guide to
<b>Floyd</b> | Playing Interactive Fiction". The full text can be found at
<b>Floyd</b> | [<a href="http://IFGuide.ramsberg.net">LINK</A>]
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle i">The game starts</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | When you start a game, you will first see an introduction, usually
<b>Floyd</b> | consisting of one or a few screenfuls of text, giving you some
<b>Floyd</b> | background on who you are, where you are, and perhaps even what your
<b>Floyd</b> | objectives in the game are. Whenever the game has printed a screenful
<b>Floyd</b> | of text, it will wait until you press ENTER or some other key, so that
<b>Floyd</b> | you get a chance to read everything before it scrolls off the top of
<b>Floyd</b> | the screen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle i">How to interact</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | When the introduction is over, you will get a prompt, usually "&gt;", but
<b>Floyd</b> | it may be a little different from game to game. The prompt means that
<b>Floyd</b> | the game is now waiting for you to tell it what you want to do. You do
<b>Floyd</b> | this by typing in imperative commands, as if you were commanding
<b>Floyd</b> | someone. Let's say the introduction told you that you are in a
<b>Floyd</b> | kitchen, and that you can see a closed glass jar standing on the
<b>Floyd</b> | kitchen counter. Commands you could try at this point include TAKE THE
<b>Floyd</b> | JAR, or OPEN THE JAR, or perhaps EXAMINE THE JAR (Throughout this
<b>Floyd</b> | document, things that are written in capital letters are complete
<b>Floyd</b> | commands that can be typed into an IF game. They don't have to be
<b>Floyd</b> | typed in capital letters when entered into a game). If you want to,
<b>Floyd</b> | you can skip the articles: TAKE JAR will work just at well as TAKE THE
<b>Floyd</b> | JAR. If there are several different jars you could mean, the game may
<b>Floyd</b> | ask you which one you mean. Just type one or more words that uniquely
<b>Floyd</b> | identifies one of the items. For instance, if the game says "Which jar
<b>Floyd</b> | do you mean, the blue glass jar or the green glass jar?", you might
<b>Floyd</b> | reply BLUE to take the blue one. You can also choose to ignore the
<b>Floyd</b> | question altogether, just typing a new command.

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Two special commands:</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There are two verbs you should be aware of in addition to the usual

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In addition, your character can LINK objects of similar properties.
<b>Floyd</b> | (e.g.: LINK SNUFFBOX TO SMALL YELLOW BOX.)  Once this link has been
<b>Floyd</b> | created, things done to one object will automatically affect the other
<b>Floyd</b> | as well... subject to certain rules.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Otherwise, this game is fairly cruel -- it is possible to render the
<b>Floyd</b> | game unwinnable, and you should save often, especially when you
<b>Floyd</b> | realize that you are about to destroy an object you may not be able to

<b>Floyd</b> | Almost every large IF project is the product of many people besides
<b>Floyd</b> | the author. This one benefited particularly from a very hard-working
<b>Floyd</b> | set of beta-testers, and, once it was released the first time, from
<b>Floyd</b> | bug reports, comments on the puzzles from rec.games.int-fiction, and
<b>Floyd</b> | reviews in SPAG, the IF Ratings site ([<a href="http://www.ifratings.com/">LINK</A>]), and
<b>Floyd</b> | IF Review. On those grounds I was persuaded not only to fix numerous
<b>Floyd</b> | horrible bugs but also to change the phrasing of some descriptions,
<b>Floyd</b> | file away a few of the game's most extreme anachronisms, and introduce
<b>Floyd</b> | a few alternate puzzle solutions. The ending, the subject of some
<b>Floyd</b> | debate, remains as it was in the original.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Any errors that remain are of course my own fault.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Coding credit:</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Credit goes to Graham Nelson for Inform; to Roger Firth for
<b>Floyd</b> | SmartCantGo and CheckOut; Daniel Barkalow for Scoper; Alan Trewartha
<b>Floyd</b> | for GoNeighbour; Gunther Schmidl for dirs_2; Andrew Plotkin for
<b>Floyd</b> | daemons; Andrew Clover for timewait; Kory Heath and Lucian Smith for
<b>Floyd</b> | the revised ReviseMulti. The new menu system uses Altmenu, DoMenu, and
<b>Floyd</b> | utility, by L. Ross Raszewski, howtoplay by Michael Coyne, and CCPL by
<b>Floyd</b> | Roger Firth.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Primary testing:</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Credit also goes to Dan Shiovitz as alpha-tester and theoretical
<b>Floyd</b> | counsel; and to Sean Barrett, Gilles Duchesne, and Admiral Jota for
<b>Floyd</b> | their Herculean beta-testing efforts. Their diligence and dedication
<b>Floyd</b> | are greatly appreciated.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Troubleshooting:</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the eleventh hour, when TAKE ALL FROM was not working for reasons
<b>Floyd</b> | unknown, the good folks from #inform stepped in: L. Ross Raszewski,
<b>Floyd</b> | Brendan Barnwell, and Andrew Schepler in particular.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">Bug Reports for Subsequent Releases:</span>
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Comments and bug reports courtesy of Jason Love, Stephen Granade,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One of a set of special dishes that the Count made. The idea was that
<b>Floyd</b> | all of the china plates in the house were linked to this one plate,
<b>Floyd</b> | which could then be washed and dried, minimizing the expenditure of
<b>Floyd</b> | time and water. Similar arrangements were made for other parts of the
<b>Floyd</b> | standard place setting; the Count spent innumerable hours refining the
<b>Floyd</b> | links.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The reason that the plate is metal rather than china is that, when the
<b>Floyd</b> | link-system was first instituted, a clumsy maid ravaged the Countess'
<b>Floyd</b> | entire crystal collection by accidentally chipping a glass.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In order to make the linkages possible, however, it has been painted a
<b>Floyd</b> | glossy white, and the crest of the family executed on one side in

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The beautiful life is always damned, they say. As for you, you've
<b>Floyd</b> | overexpended yourself: fifteen years of prominence, champagne,
<b>Floyd</b> | carriage rides in the Tuileries, having your name whispered behind
<b>Floyd</b> | manicured hands, getting elegant ladies out of elegant fixes -- and

<b>Floyd</b> | scoundrels. Your father, old peasant that he was, could have warned
<b>Floyd</b> | you against their type.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You'd hoped to find the Count at home; your original plan was to ask
<b>Floyd</b> | him for an advance on the money you expect to earn on your estate in a
<b>Floyd</b> | month or two. But according to the local population, the Count hasn't
<b>Floyd</b> | been home in months, and Marie, who was in residence until recently,
<b>Floyd</b> | has vanished as well. "No one around the big house now," says one of
<b>Floyd</b> | the peasant women tersely. "Even turned off the cook, they did."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But you need the money at once; if you return to Paris without it,
<b>Floyd</b> | your creditors are unlikely to be forgiving. So you walked over the
<b>Floyd</b> | fields anyway, and got in through the gap in the kitchen garden wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | You will just have to find what you can.

<b>Floyd</b> | Fitted out with tiny planets on arms, and the major moons of the

<b>Floyd</b> | Oddly, the contraption also seems to be linked, and quite unsubtly, to

<b>Floyd</b> | The beautiful life is always damned, they say. As for you, you've
<b>Floyd</b> | overexpended yourself: fifteen years of prominence, champagne,
<b>Floyd</b> | carriage rides in the Tuileries, having your name whispered behind
<b>Floyd</b> | manicured hands, getting elegant ladies out of elegant fixes -- and
<b>Floyd</b> | you're <span class="floydstyle em">in debt</span>. Bound by oath and honor to a pack of
<b>Floyd</b> | scoundrels. Your father, old peasant that he was, could have warned
<b>Floyd</b> | you against their type.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You'd hoped to find the Count at home; your original plan was to ask
<b>Floyd</b> | him for an advance on the money you expect to earn on your estate in a
<b>Floyd</b> | month or two. But according to the local population, the Count hasn't
<b>Floyd</b> | been home in months, and Marie, who was in residence until recently,
<b>Floyd</b> | has vanished as well. "No one around the big house now," says one of
<b>Floyd</b> | the peasant women tersely. "Even turned off the cook, they did."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But you need the money at once; if you return to Paris without it,
<b>Floyd</b> | your creditors are unlikely to be forgiving. So you walked over the
<b>Floyd</b> | fields anyway, and got in through the gap in the kitchen garden wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | You will just have to find what you can.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Several names leap out of the charts at you. D'Envers, the Count's

<b>Floyd</b> | The beautiful life is always damned, they say. As for you, you've
<b>Floyd</b> | overexpended yourself: fifteen years of prominence, champagne,
<b>Floyd</b> | carriage rides in the Tuileries, having your name whispered behind
<b>Floyd</b> | manicured hands, getting elegant ladies out of elegant fixes -- and
<b>Floyd</b> | you're <span class="floydstyle em">in debt</span>. Bound by oath and honor to a pack of
<b>Floyd</b> | scoundrels. Your father, old peasant that he was, could have warned
<b>Floyd</b> | you against their type.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You'd hoped to find the Count at home; your original plan was to ask
<b>Floyd</b> | him for an advance on the money you expect to earn on your estate in a
<b>Floyd</b> | month or two. But according to the local population, the Count hasn't
<b>Floyd</b> | been home in months, and Marie, who was in residence until recently,
<b>Floyd</b> | has vanished as well. "No one around the big house now," says one of
<b>Floyd</b> | the peasant women tersely. "Even turned off the cook, they did."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But you need the money at once; if you return to Paris without it,
<b>Floyd</b> | your creditors are unlikely to be forgiving. So you walked over the
<b>Floyd</b> | fields anyway, and got in through the gap in the kitchen garden wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | You will just have to find what you can.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The beautiful life is always damned, they say. As for you, you've
<b>Floyd</b> | overexpended yourself: fifteen years of prominence, champagne,
<b>Floyd</b> | carriage rides in the Tuileries, having your name whispered behind
<b>Floyd</b> | manicured hands, getting elegant ladies out of elegant fixes -- and

<b>Floyd</b> | scoundrels. Your father, old peasant that he was, could have warned
<b>Floyd</b> | you against their type.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You'd hoped to find the Count at home; your original plan was to ask
<b>Floyd</b> | him for an advance on the money you expect to earn on your estate in a
<b>Floyd</b> | month or two. But according to the local population, the Count hasn't
<b>Floyd</b> | been home in months, and Marie, who was in residence until recently,
<b>Floyd</b> | has vanished as well. "No one around the big house now," says one of
<b>Floyd</b> | the peasant women tersely. "Even turned off the cook, they did."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But you need the money at once; if you return to Paris without it,
<b>Floyd</b> | your creditors are unlikely to be forgiving. So you walked over the
<b>Floyd</b> | fields anyway, and got in through the gap in the kitchen garden wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | You will just have to find what you can.

<b>Floyd</b> | Then the scene grows more distant, and you feel as though you are

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The beautiful life is always damned, they say. As for you, you've
<b>Floyd</b> | overexpended yourself: fifteen years of prominence, champagne,
<b>Floyd</b> | carriage rides in the Tuileries, having your name whispered behind
<b>Floyd</b> | manicured hands, getting elegant ladies out of elegant fixes -- and
<b>Floyd</b> | you're <span class="floydstyle em">in debt</span>. Bound by oath and honor to a pack of
<b>Floyd</b> | scoundrels. Your father, old peasant that he was, could have warned
<b>Floyd</b> | you against their type.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You'd hoped to find the Count at home; your original plan was to ask
<b>Floyd</b> | him for an advance on the money you expect to earn on your estate in a
<b>Floyd</b> | month or two. But according to the local population, the Count hasn't
<b>Floyd</b> | been home in months, and Marie, who was in residence until recently,
<b>Floyd</b> | has vanished as well. "No one around the big house now," says one of
<b>Floyd</b> | the peasant women tersely. "Even turned off the cook, they did."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But you need the money at once; if you return to Paris without it,
<b>Floyd</b> | your creditors are unlikely to be forgiving. So you walked over the
<b>Floyd</b> | fields anyway, and got in through the gap in the kitchen garden wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | You will just have to find what you can.
