The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Snack Time!</i>, written by "Hardy the Bulldog" and Renee Choba.  <i>Snack Time!</i> was originally released as part of the 2008 IF Competition, where it took sixth place.  It went on to garner Xyzzy nominations for Best NPCs and Best Individual NPC, and took the Xyzzy for Best Individual PC.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Snack_Time!"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

</br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | Sitting Room
<b>Floyd</b> | This is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes
<b>Floyd</b> | too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is

<b>Floyd</b> | to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the
<b>Floyd</b> | food. That is a good room.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Even though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There
<b>Floyd</b> | are a lot of "no"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall
<b>Floyd</b> | thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still

<b>Floyd</b> | with the box of light on its back.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.

<b>Floyd</b> | Sitting Room
<b>Floyd</b> | This is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes
<b>Floyd</b> | too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is

<b>Floyd</b> | to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the
<b>Floyd</b> | food. That is a good room.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Even though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There
<b>Floyd</b> | are a lot of "no"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall
<b>Floyd</b> | thing and the four-legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still

<b>Floyd</b> | with the box of light on its back.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.

<b>Floyd</b> | Your bowl for food and water is here, but that's only the beginning.
