						The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each
						week at a pre-arranged time, a group of
						people meet online to cooperatively play
						a game of interactive fiction.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Aisle</em> written by Sam Barlow.
						 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting
						
						
							
								
								<a class="decorate" href='http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=j49crlvd62mhwuzu'>IFDB</a>.

					<br>
					
						
					
					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing this game, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played this game, and think you might like to at some
						point, I do not recommend reading any further. Instead,
						you might want to return to the <a class="decorate" href=
						"interactive_fiction.html">interactive fiction
							page</a>.<br>

<b>Floyd</b> | and puts a basket of bread and bread sticks on the table. "Prego," he

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Something about the way she stands pisses you off; she is so insolent.
<b>Floyd</b> | The gnocchi whispers in your ear, "Remember what happened last time?
<b>Floyd</b> | Prevention is always better than cure." You walk up and take a jar
<b>Floyd</b> | from the shelf. The brunette ignores you. You throw the jar.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It glances off her with a glass-bone-skin sort of crack, and she falls
<b>Floyd</b> | to the floor limply. You look over her; sauce runs down her face. No;
<b>Floyd</b> | not just sauce--a thin stream of blood is entwined in the onion and
<b>Floyd</b> | tomato. You start to run towards the exit, but just before you get
<b>Floyd</b> | there you feel the air knocked out of you as a heavy thump knocks you
<b>Floyd</b> | from the side and you are tackled to the ground.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This time the judge rules in society's best interest rather than in

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | My competition game, "The City", has its Save and Restore verbs
<b>Floyd</b> | disabled. Many people disliked this feature. A response to this,
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Aisle</span>, started out as a game which would not need the usual
<b>Floyd</b> | meta-verbs... i.e. a game with only one turn. The initial idea was:
<b>Floyd</b> | How do I make a game with only one turn interesting? Give it lots of
<b>Floyd</b> | endings--in fact there are many 'endings' and (hopefully) every
<b>Floyd</b> | sensible action results in an 'ending'. There is no winning action.
<b>Floyd</b> | There is however more going on than just this and the more endings you
<b>Floyd</b> | see the more things should become clear. Please try any action you
<b>Floyd</b> | think of, there are far more verbs, etc. than usual for a single scene
<b>Floyd</b> | in a piece of IF. If you're not sure what the game is about, read the
<b>Floyd</b> | frontispiece again--it should set you straight.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Enjoy, Sam.

<b>Floyd</b> | You scoop a packet of gnocchi off the shelves and run over to the
<b>Floyd</b> | brunette. "Hi. Take this!", you chuck the gnocchi into her trolley.
<b>Floyd</b> | She squeaks, "What? Sorry, I don't want any, thanks." She takes it out

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You wake up, lips moist with dribble, and a numb arm where you slept

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You remember the Pantheon. It looked so solid... it had stood the test
<b>Floyd</b> | of time. You were sure that nothing could be ephemeral after being
<b>Floyd</b> | near that. It was so beautiful, yet strong. Timeless. But you were
<b>Floyd</b> | wrong--it was the only thing that was so. Your life, your
<b>Floyd</b> | relationship, Clare.. all open to change, decay and collapse.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The image of the Pantheon in your head slowly sinks, failing to
<b>Floyd</b> | support you with its pillars. You move the memory aside, out of direct
<b>Floyd</b> | sight, and continue with the shopping.

<b>Floyd</b> | Your mind wanders over the day's work. Fairly usual stuff; Johnathon
<b>Floyd</b> | really pissed you off, taking your work, putting a cover on it and
<b>Floyd</b> | getting all the credit. But lunch was cool; Michelle and you had a fun
<b>Floyd</b> | chat about her new boyfriend over coffee. You pointed out that he was
<b>Floyd</b> | exactly twice her age, something she hadn't realised. Plus, you
<b>Floyd</b> | managed to get all the Longbridge account finished, which is a weight
<b>Floyd</b> | off your mind--
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A mental kick up the arse--stop thinking about work and get on with
<b>Floyd</b> | the shopping. Clare'll kill you if you're back late.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A quick scoot round the rest of the supermarket--a full trolley--then,
