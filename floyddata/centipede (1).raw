					<p class="leftalign">
					<span class="fontish smaller">The idea behind ClubFloyd
						is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of 
						people meet online to cooperatively play a game of 
						interactive fiction.<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>The Green Mountains</em> written by Clark Radwin
						
						and <em>Centipede</em> written by J. Robinson Wheeler.
						
						First, there is a demo of the (work-in-progress) Sleepmask interface to allow ClubFloyd to play games with status bars and menus properly.  The Green Mountains is...moving on, Centipede is a participant in the 2001 <a href="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/IF_Arcade">IF Arcade</a> project. 
						
						You can learn more about the games, including how to download them, by visiting
						
						
							
								the ifWiki pages: 
								
								<a class="decorate" href="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Centipede">Centipede</a>, and 
								
								<a class="decorate" href="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/The_Green_Mountains">The Green Mountains</a>

					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing these games, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played these games, and think you might like to at some
						point, I do not recommend reading any further. Instead,
						you might want to return to the <a class="decorate" href=
