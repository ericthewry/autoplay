The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Shelter from the Storm</i>, written by Eric Eve.  <i>Shelter from the Storm</i> was originally released in 2009.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Shelter_from_the_Storm"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

<b>Floyd</b> | About Shelter from the Storm

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Works of Interactive Fiction are typically narrated in the second
<b>Floyd</b> | person and present tense (e.g.  "You see a gold ring here").  From time
<b>Floyd</b> | to time there have been discussions whether this convention represents
<b>Floyd</b> | the best way of conveying an interactive narrative.  Shelter from the
<b>Floyd</b> | Storm allows you, the player, to experiment with this by choosing the

<b>Floyd</b> | person (and the tense) in which the game is narrated.  The opening
<b>Floyd</b> | screen of the game asks you to choose the person and tense of the game
<b>Floyd</b> | before you start, but you can also change your choice during the course
<b>Floyd</b> | of play.  In particular during play you can change between first,
<b>Floyd</b> | second and third person with the commands:
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | FIRST PERSON
<b>Floyd</b> | SECOND PERSON
<b>Floyd</b> | THIRD PERSON
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can also change between present and past tense with the commands:

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | PAST TENSE
<b>Floyd</b> | PRESENT TENSE
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Apart from that Shelter from the Storm is designed as a fairly
<b>Floyd</b> | conventional piece of Interactive Fiction, with not much emphasis on

<b>Floyd</b> | puzzles.  The game should be fairly straightforward, but if you need a
<b>Floyd</b> | nudge you can use the commands THINK and THINK HARDER.

<b>Floyd</b> | Credits
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Shelter from the Storm by Eric Eve
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | First and foremost, all credit to Michael J.  Roberts for creating TADS

<b>Floyd</b> | 3, and Michel Nizette for his work on devising a neat tense-switching
<b>Floyd</b> | mechanism, which was subsequently incorporated into the adv3 library;
<b>Floyd</b> | without their work this project would have been impossible.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But just as important, many thanks to my sterling team of beta-testers:
<b>Floyd</b> | Jim Aikin, Radical Al, Parham Doustdar, Keaton Graves, Jonathan Li,

<b>Floyd</b> | Reiko, Michael Neal Tenuis, and Jack Welch.  Without them a huge number
<b>Floyd</b> | of tense/person switching typos would have gone uncorrected, as well as
<b>Floyd</b> | a number of more serious bugs (including various cunning ways of
<b>Floyd</b> | getting the game into an unwinnable state).  As a result of all their
<b>Floyd</b> | efforts this game is a far more polished offering than it otherwise
<b>Floyd</b> | would have been.  The blunders that remain are, of course, no one's

<b>Floyd</b> | fault but my own.

<b>Floyd</b> | Extra Navigation Commands - GO TO and CONTINUE
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As with virtually all works of Interactive Fiction, you can move round
<b>Floyd</b> | the world of Shelter from the Storm using standard compass-movement

<b>Floyd</b> | commands like NORTH, EAST, UP and DOWN.  In addition you can use the
<b>Floyd</b> | commands GO TO and CONTINUE to move around.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The command GO TO X or FIND X (the two mean the same thing) sends you
<b>Floyd</b> | in the direction of X.  X can either be a previously-visited room, or a
<b>Floyd</b> | previously-seen object (in which case GO TO X will send you to the last

<b>Floyd</b> | location where you saw X).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The GO TO command takes you only on the first step of your journey.  To
<b>Floyd</b> | continue your journey you can use the command CONTINUE (which can be
<b>Floyd</b> | abbreviated to C).  Note that a CONTINUE command does not have to come
<b>Floyd</b> | immediately after a GO TO or CONTINUE command.  You could, for example,

<b>Floyd</b> | enter the command GO TO KITCHEN and then enter a whole series of
<b>Floyd</b> | commands for examining and interacting with your next location before
<b>Floyd</b> | issuing a CONTINUE or C command to carry on towards the kitchen.

<b>Floyd</b> | Shelter from the Storm
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Few things can be worse than breaking down on a dark night in a strange

<b>Floyd</b> | place, and even more when it looks like it's just starting to rain, and
<b>Floyd</b> | you're in danger of being late for your first posting.  Unfortunately,
<b>Floyd</b> | that was precisely what had just happened to Jack that night.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Jack was on his way to the camp he had been ordered to, but he
<b>Floyd</b> | suspected that he must have taken a wrong turn somewhere -- easy enough

<b>Floyd</b> | to do with so many signposts taken down in case of a German invasion.
<b>Floyd</b> | Then just to cap it all, his car had just broken down, leaving him
<b>Floyd</b> | stuck out in in the middle of nowhere (or somewhere on the outskirts of
<b>Floyd</b> | Salisbury Plain, which amounted to much the same thing), still miles
<b>Floyd</b> | away from where he was meant to be.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Long Road
<b>Floyd</b> | Jack was standing in the middle of a long road running roughly
<b>Floyd</b> | east-west between thick hedgerows.  His car lay abandoned about a few
<b>Floyd</b> | hundred yards up the road to the east.  Further to the east the road
<b>Floyd</b> | ran across miles of open countryside (as Jack knew because he'd just
<b>Floyd</b> | driven across it).

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | About Shelter from the Storm
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Works of Interactive Fiction are typically narrated in the second
<b>Floyd</b> | person and present tense (e.g.  "You see a gold ring here").  From time
<b>Floyd</b> | to time there have been discussions whether this convention represents

<b>Floyd</b> | the best way of conveying an interactive narrative.  Shelter from the
<b>Floyd</b> | Storm allows you, the player, to experiment with this by choosing the
<b>Floyd</b> | person (and the tense) in which the game is narrated.  The opening
<b>Floyd</b> | screen of the game asks you to choose the person and tense of the game
<b>Floyd</b> | before you start, but you can also change your choice during the course
<b>Floyd</b> | of play.  In particular during play you can change between first,

<b>Floyd</b> | second and third person with the commands:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | FIRST PERSON
<b>Floyd</b> | SECOND PERSON
<b>Floyd</b> | THIRD PERSON

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can also change between present and past tense with the commands:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | PAST TENSE
<b>Floyd</b> | PRESENT TENSE
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Apart from that Shelter from the Storm is designed as a fairly
<b>Floyd</b> | conventional piece of Interactive Fiction, with not much emphasis on
<b>Floyd</b> | puzzles.  The game should be fairly straightforward, but if you need a
<b>Floyd</b> | nudge you can use the commands THINK and THINK HARDER.

<b>Floyd</b> | Maids' Parlour
<b>Floyd</b> | If the location of this modest-sized rectangular room had not in any
<b>Floyd</b> | case suggested that it was the maids' parlour, the mild shabbiness of
<b>Floyd</b> | its furnishings would probably have given the game away.  Now that the
<b>Floyd</b> | housekeeper was apparently the only member of domestic staff retained

<b>Floyd</b> | under conditions of wartime austerity, it apparently doubled as her
<b>Floyd</b> | workroom and sitting-room.  A battered arm chair nestled against a
<b>Floyd</b> | small, scratched wooden table in one corner, while an ironing board was
<b>Floyd</b> | set up near the middle of the room, strategically close to the
<b>Floyd</b> | fireplace.  The sole door out was to the east.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | On the peg was a dark coat.  On the ironing board was an iron.  On the
<b>Floyd</b> | small table was a wireless.

<b>Floyd</b> | Angela stopped beside me.

<b>Floyd</b> | me gaping at her in horrified silence.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It was Colonel Croxley who broke that terrible silence.  'Well, that's
<b>Floyd</b> | that, then!' he declared briskly, as if commenting on a broken teacup.
<b>Floyd</b> | 'We really could have done with questioning her - but I suppose she
<b>Floyd</b> | realized that, as well as what we'd do to a spy in wartime.'  Turning
<b>Floyd</b> | to me he cut off my incipient apology adding, 'Don't blame yourself, Mr

<b>Floyd</b> | Percy, you did what you had to and I would have done exactly the same.'
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After a brief pause when nobody spoke he continued, 'This must all seem
<b>Floyd</b> | very strange, Mr Percy, so I suppose I owe you an explanation.'
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Angela threw Colonel Croxley a quick, anxious glance.

<b>Floyd</b> | 'Very well,' he nodded.  'First, as you may have gathered, neither this

<b>Floyd</b> | The man Hilda shot was an actor called Tim Durbury, who bears more than

<b>Floyd</b> | a passing resemblance to Reichsmarschall Goering.  The original idea
<b>Floyd</b> | was to see if we could train him to pass himself off as the real thing
<b>Floyd</b> | and maybe cause some havoc behind enemy lines.'
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He paused for a moment, then continued, 'Actually it became obvious
<b>Floyd</b> | almost from day one that the idea was a non-starter; poor old Durbury

<b>Floyd</b> | was never going to fool the Germans for five minutes.  If it hadn't
<b>Floyd</b> | been for Hilda we'd've packed up the whole operation weeks ago.'

<b>Floyd</b> | 'It was sheer luck that Hilda answered our advertisement for a native

<b>Floyd</b> | German-speaker who could pass as a housekeeper,' the colonel continued.
<b>Floyd</b> | 'We already knew she was a spy, and it gave us a perfect chance to use
<b>Floyd</b> | her for our own purposes.  She thought we wanted her to help Durbury to
<b>Floyd</b> | learn German well enough to pass himself off as Goering - which was
<b>Floyd</b> | obviously never going to happen in reality.  Presumably she also
<b>Floyd</b> | thought we'd given her the ideal opportunity to spy on us and pass

<b>Floyd</b> | damaging information back to the Germans.  In fact, we were simply
<b>Floyd</b> | keeping her from doing any mischief elsewhere while using her to pass
<b>Floyd</b> | false information to her masters in Berlin.'
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At that point Angela's mouth dropped open in utter astonishment.

<b>Floyd</b> | 'It was better you didn't know, lieutenant,' he replied evenly.
<b>Floyd</b> | 'You're probably an even worse actor than poor old Durbury, and I

<b>Floyd</b> | what we were really up to the better.  Unfortunately we never reckoned

<b>Floyd</b> | with Hilda being ordered to kill Durbury, which I suppose must have

<b>Floyd</b> | The kitchen looked large enough to accommodate the platoon of culinary

<b>Floyd</b> | at one end, with a single hard wooden chair right next to it, now
