The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Gun Mute</i>, written by C.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Pacian.  <i>Gun Mute</i> was originally released in 2008. You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Gun_Mute"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | Gun Mute is intended as an Interactive Fiction shoot-em-up.  Each
<b>Floyd</b> | location presents you with a simple puzzle which you must solve before
<b>Floyd</b> | you can progress to the next location and, in contrast to the Inform

<b>Floyd</b> | parser's famous default response, violence usually is the answer.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You'll find that there are only two directions to move in: FORWARDS or
<b>Floyd</b> | F; BACKWARDS or B.  Other useful, non-standard commands include:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    DRAW

<b>Floyd</b> |    SHOOT CLAW-HAND HANK
<b>Floyd</b> |    TAKE COVER BEHIND TRACTOR
<b>Floyd</b> |    WAVE TO PLAINSWOMAN
<b>Floyd</b> |    POINT AT SPEAR
<b>Floyd</b> |    NOD
<b>Floyd</b> |    SHAKE HEAD

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Note that in most locations, simply typing 'take cover' or 'duck' will
<b>Floyd</b> | automatically move you behind any available cover.  A complete list of
<b>Floyd</b> | the twenty-odd natural language commands you'll need to complete the
<b>Floyd</b> | game can be found by typing 'instructions'.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | I would finally like to add that I'm a pacifist, and this game is in
<b>Floyd</b> | no way intended to encourage you to solve real life problems with a
<b>Floyd</b> | six shooter.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |    Pacian

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | Gun Mute is much simpler than your typical work of IF, and you'll be
<b>Floyd</b> | able to progress through the game using only the commands listed below
<b>Floyd</b> | in the right ways and at the right times.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To move through the various locations you will need to refer to only
<b>Floyd</b> | two directions: forwards, towards the end of the game; or backwards

<b>Floyd</b> | through those areas you've already beaten.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    FORWARDS    or  F
<b>Floyd</b> |    BACKWARDS   or  B
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Although this is a shoot-em-up, to figure out what to shoot and why,

<b>Floyd</b> | you'll need to look around and examine your environment:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    LOOK AROUND or  L
<b>Floyd</b> |    EXAMINE POT or  X POT
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The only useful item you'll need on your journey is your trusty six

<b>Floyd</b> | shooter.  It starts in your holster, so you'll need to draw it before
<b>Floyd</b> | facing danger.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    TAKE GUN or DRAW
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your gun is good for one thing:

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    SHOOT FRED
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Naturally, your six shooter only holds six rounds:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    RELOAD

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At times you may find calm in the eye of the storm, and wish to
<b>Floyd</b> | present a more peaceful appearance.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    PUT GUN IN HOLSTER or HOLSTER GUN
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You're far from bulletproof, so when the bullets are flying, it can be
<b>Floyd</b> | a good idea to get your head down.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    TAKE COVER BEHIND ROCK
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's not always obvious what you can take cover behind, so simply

<b>Floyd</b> | typing TAKE COVER will always either move you behind cover (if there's
<b>Floyd</b> | only one obvious place to do so) or give you an informative answer
<b>Floyd</b> | about what cover is available.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Get out from behind that rock by typing:
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |    STAND
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sometimes, the only sane action is to do nothing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    WAIT or Z
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | What are you carrying, anyway?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    INVENTORY or I
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As a rough cowboy, you're naturally fond of your fluids.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |    DRINK BEER
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Beneath a violent facade, beats a tender heart.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    KISS ELIAS
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Is there something where it shouldn't be?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    REMOVE SPLINTER
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Some people may want to communicate with you, despite your apparent
<b>Floyd</b> | unpopularity.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    WAVE TO PLAINSWOMAN
<b>Floyd</b> |    POINT AT SPEAR
<b>Floyd</b> |    NOD
<b>Floyd</b> |    SHAKE HEAD
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | A number of other commands common to IF have been implemented, but are
<b>Floyd</b> | not necessary to progress and may not function as you expect (obvious
<b>Floyd</b> | example: taking items).  Some will still provide informative or
<b>Floyd</b> | amusing answers though, so experiment if you want.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You're not expected to play the whole game in one sitting.  Typing

<b>Floyd</b> | SAVE will open a dialogue that will allow you to save your progress in
<b>Floyd</b> | a file.  Typing RESTORE will allow you to load such a file.  On a
<b>Floyd</b> | smaller scale, if you stick your head above the parapet at the wrong
<b>Floyd</b> | moment, you can type UNDO to turn back time to before the last action.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Typing HINT will open up the murky and immoral world of puzzle

<b>Floyd</b> | spoilers, if you find yourself getting stuck.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, when you get bored you can close the window or type:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    QUIT

<b>Floyd</b> | Saloon
<b>Floyd</b> | Rowdy Juanita's Saloon is a homely place, and mostly clean.  A shady
<b>Floyd</b> | refuge from the wasteland sun, a shaft of harsh light shines in
<b>Floyd</b> | through the doorway, enveloping countless dancing motes of dust in its
<b>Floyd</b> | glare.  A multitude of round tables are dotted around the carefully

<b>Floyd</b> | polished bar, and sturdy wooden beams criss-cross the high ceiling.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The floor is littered with splinters of wood and broken glass.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A tattered and broken chandelier is propped up against the bar.

<b>Floyd</b> | Rowdy Juanita is lying half over the bar, trapped beneath a heavy
