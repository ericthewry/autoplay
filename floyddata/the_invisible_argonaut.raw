The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Invisible Argonaut</i>, written by Jacqueline A. Lott.  <I>The Invisible Argonaut</I> was originally released as part of the 2003 Speed-IF Argonaut.  It is a very small, very silly game, that never won any awards whatsoever.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/The_Invisible_Argonaut'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | Ah!  The life of an Argonaut!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Adventure on the high seas!  The quest for the Golden Fleece!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Of course, you get queasy just visiting the baths, and you really
<b>Floyd</b> | don't think you and the boys have a shot in Hades of ever laying eyes
<b>Floyd</b> | on that Fleece, but it was either this or stay home and continue to
<b>Floyd</b> | herd sheep, so you signed up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Once you got over the initial sea sickness, it wasn't all that bad.
<b>Floyd</b> | Your first stop, at Lemnos, lasted a year, and there were some major
<b>Floyd</b> | smoochies during that tenure.  You were just beginning to think you'd
<b>Floyd</b> | made the right choice when the boss went and uprooted everybody for
<b>Floyd</b> | the next port.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The boss, Jason... enh.  He's a good enough guy.  He means well and
<b>Floyd</b> | all, and it's not exactly like he *chose* to come on this stupid quest
<b>Floyd</b> | any more than you did, but after having some of your buddies
<b>Floyd</b> | slaughtered in the night on the island of the Mount of Bears and
<b>Floyd</b> | Hercules losing his little lover boy at Mysia, you're beginning to
<b>Floyd</b> | have second thoughts.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then came this latest port: the land of the Bebrycians.  The ruler
<b>Floyd</b> | here, King Amycus, seems to think he's the Heavyweight Champion of Mt.
<b>Floyd</b> | Olympus or something.  He won't let any of you leave the island before
<b>Floyd</b> | you have a little boxing match with him.  You were really thinking
<b>Floyd</b> | that your buddy Polydeuces the Argonaut would take him on, but
<b>Floyd</b> | Polydeuces had some business off in the bushes and the King just
<b>Floyd</b> | wouldn't wait... the next thing you knew, a couple of pretty little
<b>Floyd</b> | ladies were strapping ox-hide boxing gloves on your hands and you were
<b>Floyd</b> | in the ring with Mohammed Aliamycus.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You never thought you'd say this, but you're starting to miss those
<b>Floyd</b> | sheep.

<b>Floyd</b> | Ah!  The life of an Argonaut!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Adventure on the high seas!  The quest for the Golden Fleece!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Of course, you get queasy just visiting the baths, and you really
<b>Floyd</b> | don't think you and the boys have a shot in Hades of ever laying eyes
<b>Floyd</b> | on that Fleece, but it was either this or stay home and continue to
<b>Floyd</b> | herd sheep, so you signed up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Once you got over the initial sea sickness, it wasn't all that bad.
<b>Floyd</b> | Your first stop, at Lemnos, lasted a year, and there were some major
<b>Floyd</b> | smoochies during that tenure.  You were just beginning to think you'd
<b>Floyd</b> | made the right choice when the boss went and uprooted everybody for
<b>Floyd</b> | the next port.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The boss, Jason... enh.  He's a good enough guy.  He means well and
<b>Floyd</b> | all, and it's not exactly like he *chose* to come on this stupid quest
<b>Floyd</b> | any more than you did, but after having some of your buddies
<b>Floyd</b> | slaughtered in the night on the island of the Mount of Bears and
<b>Floyd</b> | Hercules losing his little lover boy at Mysia, you're beginning to
<b>Floyd</b> | have second thoughts.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then came this latest port: the land of the Bebrycians.  The ruler
<b>Floyd</b> | here, King Amycus, seems to think he's the Heavyweight Champion of Mt.
<b>Floyd</b> | Olympus or something.  He won't let any of you leave the island before
<b>Floyd</b> | you have a little boxing match with him.  You were really thinking
<b>Floyd</b> | that your buddy Polydeuces the Argonaut would take him on, but
<b>Floyd</b> | Polydeuces had some business off in the bushes and the King just
<b>Floyd</b> | wouldn't wait... the next thing you knew, a couple of pretty little
<b>Floyd</b> | ladies were strapping ox-hide boxing gloves on your hands and you were
<b>Floyd</b> | in the ring with Mohammed Aliamycus.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You never thought you'd say this, but you're starting to miss those
<b>Floyd</b> | sheep.
