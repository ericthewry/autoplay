The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Awakening</i>, written by Pete Gardner.  <I>Awakening</I> was originally released as part of the 2009 Saugus.net Halloween Ghost Story Contest, where it tied for first place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Awakening'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | An ear-shattering crash shocks you into wakefulness as a bolt of
<b>Floyd</b> | lightning splits the dark sky in two.  The downpour begins abruptly,
<b>Floyd</b> | pelting exposed soil with enough force to create pockmarks resembling
<b>Floyd</b> | the surface of the moon.  You realize that your eyes are open and the
<b>Floyd</b> | fat raindrops strike them relentlessly.  Another searing bolt assaults
<b>Floyd</b> | your senses, followed again by the thunderclap, but less quickly now,
<b>Floyd</b> | as the center of the storm moves away from your location.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Something deep inside you begins to grow restless. Perhaps, at last,
<b>Floyd</b> | it is time to move.  Your tongue slithers dryly in your mouth.  You

<b>Floyd</b> | In Awakening, you play the role of someone who finds himself in a
<b>Floyd</b> | strange situation and is unable to remember anything.  As the game
<b>Floyd</b> | progresses, it becomes more and more apparent what may be going on.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game is not meant to be taken seriously.  It is a light-hearted
<b>Floyd</b> | attempt at spookiness -- the sort of thing many of us may be looking
<b>Floyd</b> | for around Halloween time.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you have never played interactive fiction before, you may want to
<b>Floyd</b> | explore the help available in these menus to get you started.  There
<b>Floyd</b> | is, however, a few things about Awakening that you should know from
<b>Floyd</b> | the start:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you encounter any characters in the game, you can talk with them by
<b>Floyd</b> | typing "talk to " and then the name of the character.  For example,
<b>Floyd</b> | were you to encounter someone who was a doctor, you would say: "talk
<b>Floyd</b> | to doctor" to begin a conversation.  Doing this more than once in a
<b>Floyd</b> | row may get additional responses from him.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Another thing you can do with other characters in the game, is get
<b>Floyd</b> | them to do the same things you might do yourself.  For example, if the
<b>Floyd</b> | doctor was willing to obey you, you could type: "doctor, go north" and
<b>Floyd</b> | he would walk out of the room (assuming there really was an exit
<b>Floyd</b> | leading north).  Or, you could say "doctor, take the scalpel",
<b>Floyd</b> | "doctor, go north", "doctor, drop the scalpel" and so on.  Just
<b>Floyd</b> | remember that if you were to tell the doctor to go out of the room you
<b>Floyd</b> | are in, you may have to follow him into the new location to continue
<b>Floyd</b> | telling him what to do.  This may not be necessary, however, in a
<b>Floyd</b> | collection of rooms that are grouped together in one large, open
<b>Floyd</b> | space.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | That should be enough to get you started.  Here's hoping you enjoy the
<b>Floyd</b> | ride!
