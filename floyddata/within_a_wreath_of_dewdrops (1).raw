The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of some random speed IFs ClubFloyd played on the spur of the moment because Jacqueline had to bail due to food poisoning.  You aren't experiencing déjà vu... most of them are games ClubFloyd has indeed played before, just not by this particular cadre of folks.</BR></BR><B>Click on a title to jump to that game in the transcipt below:</B>

<b>Floyd</b> | Saturday, 25 August, 2007
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I have already written much.  Volumes, in fact, but now that I am here,
<b>Floyd</b> | standing on the brink of discovery - and I truly feel that I am indeed
<b>Floyd</b> | on the cusp - I think it only appropriate that I look back down the

<b>Floyd</b> | path which has brought me to this moment.  As I sit here, next to the
<b>Floyd</b> | fantastic glass pyramid of the Cour Napoleon at the Louvre, waiting to
<b>Floyd</b> | rendezvous with Professeur LeFou, I am tingling with anticipation...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ...perhaps all hope is not lost for the North American Velocitas
<b>Floyd</b> | fictus.   Perhaps.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the beginning, when our scientists first began to keep records, the
<b>Floyd</b> | population of V. fictus  was thriving.  The number of specimens counted
<b>Floyd</b> | during population surveys increased each year - until a peak population
<b>Floyd</b> | survey of fourteen individuals was counted in 2001.  And since that
<b>Floyd</b> | time, populations of V. fictus  have not only dropped - they've

<b>Floyd</b> | plummeted.  Now, thus far in 2007, none have been sited in North
<b>Floyd</b> | America.  Habitat loss?  Carrying capacity exceeded?  Too much worry
<b>Floyd</b> | and consternation over how long it will take to port interactive
<b>Floyd</b> | fiction interpreters to the iPhone?  Or perhaps a new exotic and
<b>Floyd</b> | possibly invasive species, Corpus exquisitus fictus,  has simply pushed
<b>Floyd</b> | V. fictus  out of its ecological niche.  The theories and debates have

<b>Floyd</b> | been unending.  But I... I alone have tried to remain above the flames,
<b>Floyd</b> | sought to lower the signal-to-noise ratio.  I alone have toiled for the
<b>Floyd</b> | answer.  It has been a lonely journey.  A journey which has brought me
<b>Floyd</b> | here...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In Search of Velocitas fictus

<b>Floyd</b> | A pseudo-serious (not really) SpeedIF by Jacqueline A. Lott
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 2 / Serial number 070826 / Inform 7 build 4U65 (I6/v6.31 lib
<b>Floyd</b> | 6/11N)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Le Cour Napoleon
<b>Floyd</b> | Professeur LeFou stated in his e-mail that he would meet you here, near

<b>Floyd</b> | the famous glass pyramid, at about this time.  He should be here any
<b>Floyd</b> | moment.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (NOTE: First time players of this game might want to type "about," and
<b>Floyd</b> | if you ever get stuck, you can get a walkthrough by typing "hint."
<b>Floyd</b> | Amusez-vous!)

<b>Floyd</b> | This is a work of SpeedIF.  SpeedIFs are intentionally written in a

<b>Floyd</b> | very short period of time; the "rule" used to be that you wrote a
<b>Floyd</b> | SpeedIF in two hours or less, but that is a rule to which few coders
<b>Floyd</b> | actually adhere.  This game was written in about seven hours, though
<b>Floyd</b> | honestly most of that time was spent relearning how to code.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game was written for SpeedIF IntroComp, a SpeedIF that was

<b>Floyd</b> | coordinated to coincide with the weekend of the IntroComp2007 awards
<b>Floyd</b> | ceremony, but which otherwise had nothing whatsoever to do with
<b>Floyd</b> | IntroComp.  The premise of this particular SpeedIF is as follows:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The dastardly Francophones have stolen the Spirit of Speed-IF; now, our
<b>Floyd</b> | hero must journey to a francophone land in order to retrieve it. Bonus

<b>Floyd</b> | points for including  a T'ang dynasty ashtray, a preserved homunculus,
<b>Floyd</b> | phlogiston, an especially fearsome goat, the taste of defeat, and/or
<b>Floyd</b> | 9-dimensional creme brulee.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Basically, the anglophone IF community hadn't done a single SpeedIF in
<b>Floyd</b> | 2007, but then we noticed the francophone IF community held a SpeedIF,

<b>Floyd</b> | and so in good fun we decided to let them inspire us a bit.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One last caveat: I adore the French people, their culture and language,
<b>Floyd</b> | and this was just written in good fun within the constraints given for
<b>Floyd</b> | the SpeedIF.

<b>Floyd</b> | other Frenchmen - he carries a bottle of red wine, some cheese, and a

<b>Floyd</b> | baguette.  Just to be truly unique, he also has a croissant.  You are

<b>Floyd</b> | He tosses aside the burden of his food and wine and holds out his hand.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Ah!  The life of an Argonaut!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Adventure on the high seas!  The quest for the Golden Fleece!
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Of course, you get queasy just visiting the baths, and you really don't
<b>Floyd</b> | think you and the boys have a shot in Hades of ever laying eyes on that
<b>Floyd</b> | Fleece, but it was either this or stay home and continue to herd sheep,
<b>Floyd</b> | so you signed up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Once you got over the initial sea sickness, it wasn't all that bad.

<b>Floyd</b> | Your first stop, at Lemnos, lasted a year, and there were some major
<b>Floyd</b> | smoochies during that tenure.  You were just beginning to think you'd
<b>Floyd</b> | made the right choice when the boss went and uprooted everybody for the
<b>Floyd</b> | next port.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The boss, Jason... enh.  He's a good enough guy.  He means well and

<b>Floyd</b> | all, and it's not exactly like he *chose* to come on this stupid quest
<b>Floyd</b> | any more than you did, but after having some of your buddies
<b>Floyd</b> | slaughtered in the night on the island of the Mount of Bears and
<b>Floyd</b> | Hercules losing his little lover boy at Mysia, you're beginning to have
<b>Floyd</b> | second thoughts.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Then came this latest port: the land of the Bebrycians.  The ruler
<b>Floyd</b> | here, King Amycus, seems to think he's the Heavyweight Champion of Mt.
<b>Floyd</b> | Olympus or something.  He won't let any of you leave the island before
<b>Floyd</b> | you have a little boxing match with him.  You were really thinking that
<b>Floyd</b> | your buddy Polydeuces the Argonaut would take him on, but Polydeuces
<b>Floyd</b> | had some business off in the bushes and the King just wouldn't wait...

<b>Floyd</b> | the next thing you knew, a couple of pretty little ladies were
<b>Floyd</b> | strapping ox-hide boxing gloves on your hands and you were in the ring
<b>Floyd</b> | with Mohammed Aliamycus.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You never thought you'd say this, but you're starting to miss those
<b>Floyd</b> | sheep.
