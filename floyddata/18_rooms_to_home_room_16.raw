						The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each
						week at a pre-arranged time, a group of
						people meet online to cooperatively play
						a game of interactive fiction.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>18 Rooms to Home (Room 16)</em> written by Carolyn VanEseltine.
						18 Rooms to Home is an experimental work of serialized interactive fiction. This transcript contains the third installment. ClubFloyd has also played all <A HREF="intfic_clubfloyd_20150601.html"><U>previous installments</U></A>.

					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of

<b>Floyd</b> | 6/12N)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 18 Rooms to Home is a serialized game that begins at the end.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As each update is released, the story will move further back in time -
<b>Floyd</b> | so the first release includes room 18, the second will include room 17
<b>Floyd</b> | and 18, the third includes 16, 17, and 18, and so on. All released
<b>Floyd</b> | rooms are available at [<a href=".">LINK</A>]
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This release is Room 16. This is near the end of Yesenia's journey,
<b>Floyd</b> | but it's just a short way into yours.

</b><b>Floyd</b> | Tourists move down the steps toward Cabrillo Pavilion in long waves,
<b>Floyd</b> | unconsciously mimicking the ocean beyond. Yesenia loiters awkwardly at
<b>Floyd</b> | the sidewalk's edge and pretends to be fascinated by the fat little
<b>Floyd</b> | palm trees, the blue sign reading ZOO with its arrow, or anything else
<b>Floyd</b> | that will keep her face away from pedestrians.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Yesenia turns at the distant roar of a bus. The familiar white body
<b>Floyd</b> | with its upper yellow stripe comes around the bend, and she reads 20
<b>Floyd</b> | Carpinteria with relief. The crowd at the bus stop shuffles around,
<b>Floyd</b> | and Yesenia queues up to board, rolling the flowered suitcase behind
<b>Floyd</b> | her.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle subheader">20 to Carpinteria</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | It's like any other MTD bus: bluish-gray plastic seats crowded with
<b>Floyd</b> | passengers, huge windows, and an array of silver poles and black
<b>Floyd</b> | straps for standing passengers. No one's standing right now, though.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The driver taps the fare box and gives Yesenia a meaningful look.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Yesenia braces her suitcase against her leg.

<b>Floyd</b> | Yesenia flattens the two singles against the fare box and then feeds

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The driver says, "No change," and points at the sign that says the
<b>Floyd</b> | same thing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Yesenia says, "That's fine," and she hefts her suitcase and moves
<b>Floyd</b> | further in so the next person can pay. There are still a few seats
<b>Floyd</b> | free: one at the front behind the driver (occupied by a newspaper),

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A portly man in his mid-forties opens up his iPad and starts listening
<b>Floyd</b> | to the news. Yesenia can tell that he's listening to the news because
