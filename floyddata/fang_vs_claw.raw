The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of three IntroComp Games: <I>Closed Circles</I>, by M. M. Kathrel, <I>Fang Vs. Claw a.k.a. The Duel That Spanned the Ages Episode 2</I> by Oliver Ullmann, and <I>For the Love Of Ornery Blue Yaks</I> by Doug Jones.  These three games were originally released as part of the 2010 IntroComp, where they received Honorable Mentions.  You can learn more about all these games, including how to download them, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/IntroComp_2010'><u>the IntroComp 2010 page on the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br>

The transcript begins with <I>Closed Circles</I>.  If you'd like to skip to the transcript for <I>Fang Vs. Claw</I>, click <A HREF="#fangvclaw"><U>here</U></A>, and if you'd like to skip straight to <I>For the Love Of Ornery Blue Yaks</I>, click <A HREF="#flooby"><U>here</U></A>.</br></br>

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | Welcome to the Cheap Glk Implementation, library version 0.9.0.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Welcome to the IF story "Closed Circles".
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Before heading into the story there are a few things to be mentioned
<b>Floyd</b> | to help you get the richest possible experience of the tale.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You will enter the story as a story character, free (within limits) to
<b>Floyd</b> | interact with the elements of the story and the story world.  Your
<b>Floyd</b> | story character - the protagonist - will come with ideas, a personal
<b>Floyd</b> | history, and a general outlook on life that you may not agree with,
<b>Floyd</b> | but which you cannot alter.  You as a reader are invited to accompany

<b>Floyd</b> | this character and to an extent decide his actions.  You will be
<b>Floyd</b> | challenged, both as the story character and as a reader to make up
<b>Floyd</b> | your mind about what is going on, and what is the appropriate response
<b>Floyd</b> | to what the protagonist experiences.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you at any time wish to be reminded of the most common ways of

<b>Floyd</b> | interacting with the story (commands that are available to you) you
<b>Floyd</b> | can type "help" to bring up a separate banner window with a static
<b>Floyd</b> | list of options.  There will be other ways of interacting with the
<b>Floyd</b> | story too, but it is up to you to find them.  Pay attention to what
<b>Floyd</b> | the story suggest that you do.  That way you will be pointed in the
<b>Floyd</b> | right direction.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "About" will bring up the story's cover art.  "Credits" will give you
<b>Floyd</b> | the acknowledgments of the game.  If nothing you type bring any
<b>Floyd</b> | reactions from the window, take a glance at the status bar at the
<b>Floyd</b> | bottom of the screen.  You may be inside a narrative that prompts you
<b>Floyd</b> | to hit the space bar to continue, like this screen.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now when you are ready, you can hit the space bar and be transported
<b>Floyd</b> | to where the story begins.  When you do, this introduction will be
<b>Floyd</b> | cleared from your window.  Remember; "help" will bring up a separate
<b>Floyd</b> | banner window with a sample list of options.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | SPECIAL NOTICE: To my best estimate this intro is about 15% of the
<b>Floyd</b> | story as it will eventually be, and it is intended for the IF
<b>Floyd</b> | IntroComp only.  The submission consists of 7 rooms, several objects,
<b>Floyd</b> | but no NPCs.  When you reach Part II of the story the narrative stops
<b>Floyd</b> | mid-stride, but you can go back and forth to discover more of the
<b>Floyd</b> | content, for as long as you like.  My apologies in advance for all

<b>Floyd</b> | those bugs and other ugliness that is bound to crop up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Kathrel

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You are transported through time and imagination to a dark and cold

<b>Floyd</b> | place, and you slowly become aware of your surroundings.  In
<b>Floyd</b> | particular a most annoying voice:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Time and time again the world has developed through the opposition of
<b>Floyd</b> | new ideas against old ones," someone says.  "It is an ageless war
<b>Floyd</b> | where the old ways are bound to lose on the trivial grounds that

<b>Floyd</b> | victory inevitably is defined by the survivors.  And in its widest
<b>Floyd</b> | sense the core of progress is to act in the interest of self
<b>Floyd</b> | preservation."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The words seem to drone meaningless and disembodied around in your
<b>Floyd</b> | mind, uttered from afar, or perhaps remembered.  Somehow they seem

<b>Floyd</b> | important.  You are not really sure why; right now rest holds more
<b>Floyd</b> | appeal than lectures.  But the churning wont't stop;
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Conflict.  Progress.  Self preservation.  Duty.  It goes on and on.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Go to hell," you think, but the thought appears automatic and without

<b>Floyd</b> | context.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A loud clatter from somewhere nearby makes you start, and the movement
<b>Floyd</b> | provokes a wave of nausea.  You curl up and retch emptily with your
<b>Floyd</b> | face down into trampled grass, and agony explodes inside your chest
<b>Floyd</b> | with sudden brutality.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Self preservation.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You open your eyes again, recognizing that self preservation as a
<b>Floyd</b> | practical excercise drives home a much harder lesson than a lecture.

<b>Floyd</b> | CLOSED CIRCLES
<b>Floyd</b> | Part I
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | by M.  M.  Kathrel, (c) 2010

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Version 0.5, an IntroComp contribution.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A swath of downtrodden grass (lying on the ground)
<b>Floyd</b> | The sky is dark and chasing clouds are gathering into black mountains

<b>Floyd</b> | defined by the blinking stars they blot out as they build.  Cold wind
<b>Floyd</b> | puts a vast ocean of surrounding grass into swaying motion.  The moon
<b>Floyd</b> | is up, and its bleak presence reveals a grotesque scene: Wooden debris
<b>Floyd</b> | is scattered across a swath of partly downtrodden grass.  Clothes are
<b>Floyd</b> | trampled into the dirt.  A looming silhouette turns out to be a broken
<b>Floyd</b> | stage coach, tilting towards you on three wheels.  The missing wheel

<b>Floyd</b> | is nowhere in sight.  A body hangs out of a window next to an open
<b>Floyd</b> | door swinging in the wind, and suitcases and bags are lying around,
<b>Floyd</b> | open, their contents spilled on the ground.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The grass is trampled in a corridor to the north, outlining a track of
<b>Floyd</b> | sorts.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You grit your teeth; your rib cage feels like a conflagration, and
<b>Floyd</b> | something is wrong with your right leg.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "The harbor master assigned me an apprentice at the lighthouse.  I'm

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Before heading into the story there are a few things to be mentioned

<b>Floyd</b> | to help you get the richest possible experience of the tale.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You will enter the story as a story character, free (within limits) to
<b>Floyd</b> | interact with the elements of the story and the story world.  Your
<b>Floyd</b> | story character - the protagonist - will come with ideas, a personal
<b>Floyd</b> | history, and a general outlook on life that you may not agree with,

<b>Floyd</b> | but which you cannot alter.  You as a reader are invited to accompany
<b>Floyd</b> | this character and to an extent decide his actions.  You will be
<b>Floyd</b> | challenged, both as the story character and as a reader to make up
<b>Floyd</b> | your mind about what is going on, and what is the appropriate response
<b>Floyd</b> | to what the protagonist experiences.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | If you at any time wish to be reminded of the most common ways of
<b>Floyd</b> | interacting with the story (commands that are available to you) you
<b>Floyd</b> | can type "help" to bring up a separate banner window with a static
<b>Floyd</b> | list of options.  There will be other ways of interacting with the
<b>Floyd</b> | story too, but it is up to you to find them.  Pay attention to what
<b>Floyd</b> | the story suggest that you do.  That way you will be pointed in the

<b>Floyd</b> | right direction.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "About" will show you this introduction.  "Credits" will give you the
<b>Floyd</b> | acknowledgments of the game.  If nothing you type bring any reactions
<b>Floyd</b> | from the window, take a glance at the status bar at the bottom of the
<b>Floyd</b> | screen.  You may be inside a narrative that prompts you to hit the

<b>Floyd</b> | space bar to continue, like this screen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Remember; "help" will bring up a separate banner window with a sample
<b>Floyd</b> | list of options.

<b>Floyd</b> | amplified by the sheer canyon walls. On the opposite side of the rift,

<b>Floyd</b> | you can glimpse some nooks and crannies in the wall. Caves maybe?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You've regarded this point as a dead end until now. But with all other
