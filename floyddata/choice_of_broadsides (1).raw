The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Choice of Broadsides</i>, written by Adam Strong-Morse, Heather Albano, and Dan Fabulich.  <I>Choice of Broadsides</I> was released in 2010.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Choice_of_Broadsides'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | your first command; I have the utmost confidence in you!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Thank you, sir," you reply, touching your hat in salute.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Just at that moment, first lieutenant Pigot rounds the corner.  "Mr.
<b>Floyd</b> | Rockersuke," he remarks, somewhat stiffly. "Fine piece of luck you've
<b>Floyd</b> | had."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Pigot, with over twenty-five years experience, is by far the most
<b>Floyd</b> | senior lieutenant on board--perhaps in the whole fleet--but it's not to
<b>Floyd</b> | his credit. He's too incompetent to earn a promotion to commander; he's
<b>Floyd</b> | watched countless younger, more competent lieutenants pass him by,
<b>Floyd</b> | while he racks up years of "valuable experience."  All he has to show
<b>Floyd</b> | for it is the power to boss the other lieutenants around imperiously,
<b>Floyd</b> | and he rarely misses an opportunity.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Luck has not a bit to do with it, I say!" Bryce counters cheerfully.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, go on then! Don't want to keep the prize waiting!"

<b>Floyd</b> | "Good day, Mr. Rockersuke.  My first question to you is as follows.
<b>Floyd</b> | You are in temporary command of a 36-gun ship, returning to Albion with
<b>Floyd</b> | maximum haste.  The wind is with you, and you are at full sail.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | barometer reports a sudden drop in pressure.  What do you do next?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: I don't know the answer! I'm going to fail the exam!

<b>Floyd</b> | off the water. Through your stinging eyes, you can see looming up ahead
<b>Floyd</b> | the cliffs of a little island--a tiny place, uninhabited according to
<b>Floyd</b> | the charts. About halfway between the prow of Courageous and the
<b>Floyd</b> | island, the sea is marked by the white canvas sail of a Gaulish
<b>Floyd</b> | merchant ship--streaking towards the island as fast as she can go,
<b>Floyd</b> | running desperately away from Courageous's pursuit.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "More sail!" the Captain commands.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Immediately the men jump to obey, feet pounding on the deck and shouts
<b>Floyd</b> | echoing from the rigging. Canvas snaps and billows overheard.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But you can tell it isn't enough. The little Gaulish ship is faster

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One day some weeks later, on your way back from drawing your half-pay,
<b>Floyd</b> | you run into your old friend Bryce. "Rockersuke, what good luck to meet
<b>Floyd</b> | up with you! You must come and dine with me tonight. I want to
<b>Floyd</b> | introduce you to my wife."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You enjoy the meal very much. Mrs. Bryce is a charming hostess,
<b>Floyd</b> | gracious and sweet and well-mannered, and Bryce is obviously devoted to
<b>Floyd</b> | her. After dinner, you and Bryce sit drinking rum and storytelling long
<b>Floyd</b> | into the night.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Suddenly Bryce says, "So what about you, Rockersuke? High time you got
<b>Floyd</b> | married, isn't it?" He looks at you shrewdly and laughs. "You're about
<b>Floyd</b> | to tell me you've been too busy to think of it. Well, you'll have
<b>Floyd</b> | plenty of leisure while you're on half-pay! You should think about it
<b>Floyd</b> | now!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You consider the idea. What do you conclude?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A: Bryce seems to have stumbled onto a good thing. It might be. . .
<b>Floyd</b> | kind of nice to have something like this myself. A home to return to, a
<b>Floyd</b> | loving wife. . .
<b>Floyd</b> | B: Bryce is right: marriage to the right kind of woman could be very
<b>Floyd</b> | useful as I try to advance in my career.
<b>Floyd</b> | C: Marriage? Not me! I don't want to be tied down to anyone.
<b>Floyd</b> | D: The idea of a wife has never held any appeal for me. . . It's

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After several days of this brutal regimen, you see real improvement.
<b>Floyd</b> | The men are more alert, quicker in responding to the changes you order.
<b>Floyd</b> | The crispness and speed of the sloop's maneuvers improves, and you find
<b>Floyd</b> | that the sloop is both more maneuverable and faster than you had
<b>Floyd</b> | thought when you first assumed command.  The men groan as you order
<b>Floyd</b> | them aloft each day, but slowly they are becoming a credit to the Royal
<b>Floyd</b> | Navy. However, it's clear that they haven't had to work this hard in
<b>Floyd</b> | quite some time; you manage to overhear a few surly grumbles from the
<b>Floyd</b> | crew, though you don't manage to catch any particular sailor grumbling.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | &gt; In compensation for how hard you've been working the men, you give
<b>Floyd</b> | them a "rope yarn Sunday"--a day when their duties are cut back to the
<b>Floyd</b> | bare minimum necessary to keep the sloop sailing.  Even though the rope
<b>Floyd</b> | yarn Sunday doesn't fall on an actual Sunday, you let them relax as if
<b>Floyd</b> | it did, and in fact more than on most Sundays.  Some of the men skylark
<b>Floyd</b> | on deck, while others take to gambling and similar recreations.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | mood of the crew improves dramatically as the men have some time to
<b>Floyd</b> | themselves and a little bit of an opportunity to relax.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Unfortunately, a relaxed mood is not necessarily what you want in the
<b>Floyd</b> | Royal Navy.  You begin to notice that some of the men are slow to touch
<b>Floyd</b> | their brows when they address an officer, and even forget to say "sir"
<b>Floyd</b> | when they ought.  The omissions are small, but the Royal Navy requires
<b>Floyd</b> | shows of respect for a reason.  As the rope yarn Sunday ends, the men
<b>Floyd</b> | grumble about returning to their duties, muttering among themselves and
<b>Floyd</b> | taking their time in obeying their orders.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The sloop's happiness increases, but its discipline decreases.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You believe that, overall, the crew is reasonably happy but poorly
<b>Floyd</b> | disciplined.

<b>Floyd</b> | "It's a difficult crew, sir," volunteers Mr. Carter.  "Many of these

<b>Floyd</b> | have earned a small additional amount of support higher up in the Royal
<b>Floyd</b> | Navy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your frigate, H.M.S. Dauntless, sails into Kingsport harbor.  Kingsport
<b>Floyd</b> | is the principal harbor city in one of Albion's major colonial
<b>Floyd</b> | possessions in the tropics.  The fleet based out of Kingsport consists
<b>Floyd</b> | mostly of frigates like your own--perfect for raiding Gaulish shipping
<b>Floyd</b> | and for defending Albion's own merchant marine from the depredations of
<b>Floyd</b> | the Gaulish Navy and privateers.  Assignment to this fleet is quite a
<b>Floyd</b> | plum, with great opportunities for prize money and pleasant ports of
<b>Floyd</b> | call on the tropical islands.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Shortly after your ship makes port, while you are overseeing the
<b>Floyd</b> | process of taking on new supplies, the signal midshipman runs up to
<b>Floyd</b> | you.  He touches his hat in salute and says, "Signal from the flag:

<b>Floyd</b> | please come to the flagship at your convenience."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Acknowledge the signal and inform the officer of the watch to have my

<b>Floyd</b> | asks you to report to the flagship, it is "convenient" for you to drop
<b>Floyd</b> | whatever you are doing and to head over immediately.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Within a minute, your boat is lowered over the frigate's side.  Upon
<b>Floyd</b> | your arrival, smartly dressed sailors and a marine honor guard pipe you
<b>Floyd</b> | aboard H.M.S. Indomitable, the admiral's flag ship.  The flag
<b>Floyd</b> | lieutenant touches his hat to each of the arriving captains.  "Sir, if

<b>Floyd</b> | of the rules of neutrality, none of you can take stations within sight
<b>Floyd</b> | of Blue Island.  I want Vigilant to patrol to the east of the island,
<b>Floyd</b> | Intrepid to sail to the west, and Dauntless to patrol to the north.
<b>Floyd</b> | One of you should be able to force Lynx to action as she sails out.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I am also well aware of the fact that a 44-gun frigate is

<b>Floyd</b> | You sail H.M.S. Dauntless into position--north of the main port of Blue

<b>Floyd</b> | requires a certain amount of tacking and sailing back and forth, but

<b>Floyd</b> | starboard!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You pull out your spyglass and look at each ship.  The ship to port
<b>Floyd</b> | looks like a fully-loaded large Gaulish merchant ship.  It would be
<b>Floyd</b> | easy prey for a 38-gun frigate like Dauntless and would fetch you a
<b>Floyd</b> | substantial payment in prize money.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But the ship to starboard is a warship.  You can't be certain at this

<b>Floyd</b> | been sent to defeat.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What do you do?
<b>Floyd</b> |
