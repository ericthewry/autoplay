<b>Floyd</b> | You are in a prison that has 32767 cells. The Guv' has said that a new
<b>Floyd</b> | policy has been brought in by the Gov'. Due to prison crowding they're
<b>Floyd</b> | offering every prisoner the chance to be freed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In order to decide who gets set free, The Guv' will ask each prisoner
<b>Floyd</b> | which cell they choose. The prisoner will then be escorted to that
<b>Floyd</b> | cell where they will spend the night.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | During the night, a piece of card will be attached to each cell door
<b>Floyd</b> | on which will be written the word "keep" on one side and the word
<b>Floyd</b> | "release" on the other. The piece of card will start off with the word
<b>Floyd</b> | "keep" visible.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Guv' will turn around every piece of card so that the word
<b>Floyd</b> | "release" is now visible. Afterwards every second piece of card will
<b>Floyd</b> | be turned then every third and so on until the last card has been
<b>Floyd</b> | turned.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I don't make the rules," he says, "I only go to ridiculous lengths to
<b>Floyd</b> | enforce them."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If at dawn when all the cards have been turned, the word "keep" is
<b>Floyd</b> | visible on a cell door, its prisoner will be forced to live out the
<b>Floyd</b> | rest of their sentence, but if the word "release" is visible on a cell
<b>Floyd</b> | door, its prisoner will be released.

<b>Floyd</b> | You are in a prison that has 32767 cells. The Guv' has said that a new

<b>Floyd</b> | offering every prisoner the chance to be freed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In order to decide who gets set free, The Guv' will ask each prisoner
<b>Floyd</b> | which cell they choose. The prisoner will then be escorted to that
<b>Floyd</b> | cell where they will spend the night.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | During the night, a piece of card will be attached to each cell door
<b>Floyd</b> | on which will be written the word "keep" on one side and the word
<b>Floyd</b> | "release" on the other. The piece of card will start off with the word
<b>Floyd</b> | "keep" visible.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Guv' will turn around every piece of card so that the word
<b>Floyd</b> | "release" is now visible. Afterwards every second piece of card will
<b>Floyd</b> | be turned then every third and so on until the last card has been
<b>Floyd</b> | turned.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I don't make the rules," he says, "I only go to ridiculous lengths to
<b>Floyd</b> | enforce them."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If at dawn when all the cards have been turned, the word "keep" is

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You are in a prison that has 32767 cells. The Guv' has said that a new
<b>Floyd</b> | policy has been brought in by the Gov'. Due to prison crowding they're
<b>Floyd</b> | offering every prisoner the chance to be freed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In order to decide who gets set free, The Guv' will ask each prisoner
<b>Floyd</b> | which cell they choose. The prisoner will then be escorted to that
<b>Floyd</b> | cell where they will spend the night.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | During the night, a piece of card will be attached to each cell door
<b>Floyd</b> | on which will be written the word "keep" on one side and the word
<b>Floyd</b> | "release" on the other. The piece of card will start off with the word
<b>Floyd</b> | "keep" visible.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Guv' will turn around every piece of card so that the word
<b>Floyd</b> | "release" is now visible. Afterwards every second piece of card will
<b>Floyd</b> | be turned then every third and so on until the last card has been
<b>Floyd</b> | turned.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I don't make the rules," he says, "I only go to ridiculous lengths to
<b>Floyd</b> | enforce them."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If at dawn when all the cards have been turned, the word "keep" is
<b>Floyd</b> | visible on a cell door, its prisoner will be forced to live out the
<b>Floyd</b> | rest of their sentence, but if the word "release" is visible on a cell
<b>Floyd</b> | door, its prisoner will be released.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Alright, you little oik," says The Guv',"which cell is it going to
<b>Floyd</b> | be?"

<b>Floyd</b> | They laughed at you at the Diamond Room. They boo'ed you offstage at

<b>Floyd</b> | true. Love came to play, and not just <span class="floydstyle em">play:</span> it came to kill

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With the music as the engine, with the souls as fuel, with your hand

<b>Floyd</b> | This is a <span class="floydstyle em">single-moment</span> text-adventure by S. John Ross, a
<b>Floyd</b> | freebie fun-time toy from Cumberland Games & Diversions. You can enjoy
<b>Floyd</b> | this game on its own, but it's also one "fingertip track" on <span class="floydstyle i">Apollo</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle i">18+20: The IF Tribute Album,</span> a collection of themed games by many
<b>Floyd</b> | authors, honoring They Might Be Giants. There are full-sized games
<b>Floyd</b> | (based on the full-sized album tracks) and several single-moment
<b>Floyd</b> | fingertip games as well (the fingertips were little fragmentary
<b>Floyd</b> | tracks, often just a few seconds long).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If you're looking for hints ... well, there's no way to win or lose,
<b>Floyd</b> | really. Make a single move (VERB THE NOUN) and the game is over (only
<b>Floyd</b> | it's not <span class="floydstyle em">really</span> over, since you can explore that same moment
<b>Floyd</b> | again and again). There <span class="floydstyle em">is</span> a command that ends the game
<b>Floyd</b> | utterly, so you can look for that if you want to. I would. But I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | biased.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As per usual, everything would be worthless crapola without the
<b>Floyd</b> | testers (Gwyn Adams, Ruth Alfasso, Chris Creel, Dan Efran, Dave
<b>Floyd</b> | LeCompte, Zed Lopez, Eric Nail, Melvin Rangasamy and Daniel Suptic).
<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks also to Kevin Jackson-Mead for organizing the tribute, to Zarf
<b>Floyd</b> | for suggesting the fingertips be single-move games, and to Sam Barlow
<b>Floyd</b> | for <span class="floydstyle em">Aisle.</span>

<b>Floyd</b> | Before you can pick up the cigarette, a security guard runs over and
<b>Floyd</b> | tackles you to the ground.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Hey! Whoah! Easy, fella. That's not a real cigarette." The director
<b>Floyd</b> | turns his ire from the security guard to you. "And YOU! We did you a
<b>Floyd</b> | big favor by not even forcing you to SEEM to smoke. That's just water
<b>Floyd</b> | vapor. We'd have all kinds of ethical troubles if that was a REAL
<b>Floyd</b> | smoke. State Assembly bums dragging their feet on common-sense
<b>Floyd</b> | exceptions cuz the smoking ban zapped EXPERIMENTS to show indoor
<b>Floyd</b> | smoking's even worse than we thought." But he waves you off when you
<b>Floyd</b> | try to apologize.

<b>Floyd</b> | Congratulations! You found a new way to die, or mess up, or mess up

<b>Floyd</b> | Surely the other 37 games in this archive, some by much more acclaimed
<b>Floyd</b> | and established authors than me, aren't as health conscious and
<b>Floyd</b> | socially motivated as this one?

<b>Floyd</b> | that's better will waste even more of your precious time?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Understand, here, I just wanted to give you the whole picture before

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game was written for the intfiction.org They Might Be Giants
<b>Floyd</b> | tribute. It follows the Fingertips mini-song "I'm Having a Heart
<b>Floyd</b> | Attack" and, like the other Fingertips games, consists of only one
<b>Floyd</b> | (meaningful) move. In this case, looking and examining and other
<b>Floyd</b> | non-time-consuming actions (like this) don't (always) count.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game was designed in the mold of the AISLE or Pick up the Phone
<b>Floyd</b> | Booth and Die joke games the Interactive Fiction community knows so
<b>Floyd</b> | well. I immediately thought "Hey, I could write a game called Pick Up
<b>Floyd</b> | the Lit Cigarette and Die," but I realized it'd be trolling to release
<b>Floyd</b> | in a totally serious venue.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I don't think I'm trying to make any big social point with this,
<b>Floyd</b> | except I remember doodling about making my own text adventure games in
<b>Floyd</b> | health class well before Inform 7 existed. Especially during the
<b>Floyd</b> | wretchedly overdone movies.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | That said, Aisle by Sam Barlow is well done and has a deeper story
<b>Floyd</b> | than this. Check it out, if you haven't.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 1 was 3/26/2012 for the tribute album.
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 2 was 4/15/2012. It added a point and tightened up writing and
<b>Floyd</b> | made more variable responses.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | See CREDITS for a list of people who helped, directly and indirectly,
<b>Floyd</b> | with this game.

<b>Floyd</b> | dying, and it involved guessing a verb!
<b>Floyd</b> | You feel like you've really earned that paycheck, man. There's not
<b>Floyd</b> | much else to do. You just know it!

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You go to take the paycheck. It's just lying out there. Since the
<b>Floyd</b> | script writers didn't fulfill their contract, legally...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you take your paycheck, the director takes you aside.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Good work today. You'll get a raise for this. And you'll deserve it.
<b>Floyd</b> | Truth be told, I saw MANAGEMENT MATERIAL out there. I mean, there're
<b>Floyd</b> | actors for acting's sake and all that rubbish, but you're clearly so
<b>Floyd</b> | much MORE than that."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Congratulations on winning my little game here, such as it can be won!
<b>Floyd</b> | I actually intended it to be a sort of meta-exercise for the reader to
<b>Floyd</b> | get points for trying standard Interactive Fiction verbs. Or, if not
<b>Floyd</b> | points, funny reactions.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In addition, I also created a crude coding engine so I could easily
<b>Floyd</b> | add verbs, add a second response (when I couldn't decide my favorite,)
<b>Floyd</b> | and even add cheating directions for if you read the director's
<b>Floyd</b> | notepad, which you did, though I hope there wasn't too much
<b>Floyd</b> | verb-guessing. I also plan to send out the source code, not as a
<b>Floyd</b> | shining example, but because I'm pleased with the flexibility I had.

<b>Floyd</b> | You awake in a room. The space is completely empty apart from a
<b>Floyd</b> | computer screen and a keyboard underneath it, both built into the
