The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>&gt; by @</i>, written by Aaron Reed, followed by <I>Tryst of Fate</I> by G. M. Zagurski.  <I>&gt; by @</I> was originally released as part of the 2010 TWIFcomp, where it took first place.  As of the posting of this transcript, it has been nominated for a Xyzzy for Best use of Innovation, but the winners have not yet been announced.  <I>Tryst of Fate</I> was originally released in 1997.  You can learn more about <i>&gt; by @</i> and <I>Tryst of Fate</I>, including how to download them, by visiting <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/TWIFcomp"><u>this ifWiki </u>p<U>a</U>g<U>e</U></I></A> and <A HREF="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Tryst_of_Fate"><u>this ifWiki </u>p<U>a</U>g<U>e</U></I></A>, respectively.  <i>&gt; by @</i> is incredibly short, but if you'd like to skip straight to the <I>Tryst of Fate</I> transcript, you can click <A HREF="#tryst"><U>here</U></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.

<b>Floyd</b> | while your head goes east. East, a direction typically no worse than

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | General Store

<b>Floyd</b> | The musty smell of rotting wood greets your arrival at this rather
<b>Floyd</b> | dark dry goods store. An empty wood and glass counter parallel to the

<b>Floyd</b> | candy once plentiful in each of the adjacent bins. The shelves behind
<b>Floyd</b> | the counter are now only a repository for dust and a framework for
<b>Floyd</b> | countless cobwebs. The wooden floorboards, once sanded and polished,

<b>Floyd</b> | are now buckled and decrepit. A pair of broken doors leads out to the

<b>Floyd</b> | General Store
<b>Floyd</b> | The musty smell of rotting wood greets your arrival at this rather

<b>Floyd</b> | candy once plentiful in each of the adjacent bins. The shelves behind

<b>Floyd</b> | the counter are now only a repository for dust and a framework for
<b>Floyd</b> | countless cobwebs. The wooden floorboards, once sanded and polished,
<b>Floyd</b> | are now buckled and decrepit. A pair of broken doors leads out to the
<b>Floyd</b> | south and an open screen door leads to the west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One of the floorboards squeaks when you step on it.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the shelves are a stack of gum base and a box (in which is a dozen

<b>Floyd</b> | seeks the shelter of George's shack so as not to have to brave the

<b>Floyd</b> | out of the brush onto the main trail. Without hesitation, the horse
<b>Floyd</b> | continues north along the trail across Clear Creek and then northeast
<b>Floyd</b> | toward Blind Canyon.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As the horse makes the last turn into the canyon, Beetlebaum startles
<b>Floyd</b> | at the sight of something up ahead on the trail. At this point, you

<b>Floyd</b> | and the horse go your own separate ways. Beetlebaum falls to the

<b>Floyd</b> | Black Thad's eyes turn big as saucers as he spots the daunting sight
<b>Floyd</b> | of George and Beetlebaum racing down the trail at full gallop.
<b>Floyd</b> | Beetlebaum's eyes are filled with rage, his nose flared, and thick
<b>Floyd</b> | white foam spews from his mouth. Just as Beetlebaum lowers his head

<b>Floyd</b> | for a full charge, George screams out in an earsplitting yell, "HERE
<b>Floyd</b> | COMES BEETLEBAUM!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Black Thad, out of reflex, goes for his right gun first to shoot the
<b>Floyd</b> | charging horse. His thumbless hand fumbles the gun around and then
<b>Floyd</b> | drops it to the ground. In an instant, but an instant too late, he

<b>Floyd</b> | goes for his other gun with his good hand. Beetlebaum, with his ears
<b>Floyd</b> | back, plows into Black Thad like a freight train. Black Thad is
<b>Floyd</b> | launched into the air from the collision and slams into the canyon
<b>Floyd</b> | wall. What life may have been left in Black Thad is certainly
<b>Floyd</b> | concluded by the ensuing rockslide.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | After the dust clears a little, George stares at you for a moment and
<b>Floyd</b> | says, "I just knew you'd be the one to clean up around these parts.
<b>Floyd</b> | Heck, when I tricked ol' Frank into goin' above to rile yuh up, I
<b>Floyd</b> | could just feel it in mah bones. Beetlebaum, get yer miserable hide
<b>Floyd</b> | over here!"
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | As Beetlebaum saunters over, still wet with sweat, George opens the
<b>Floyd</b> | saddlebag and takes out a blue gumball and hands it to you. "Go on,
<b>Floyd</b> | get on home! I don't take to no good-byes from no woman." George
<b>Floyd</b> | pauses, and then breaks out in a big smile and chortles, "Ah heck, ya
<b>Floyd</b> | done good. Hell, ya done great. I's can't thank ya enough fer helpin'
<b>Floyd</b> | out. Let's get some grub and get ya on yer way."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After a pleasant meal of beans and jerky, you say your good-byes to

<b>Floyd</b> | 1. The House
<b>Floyd</b> | The house depicted is the house we currently live in. As this game was
<b>Floyd</b> | originally written for my wife, I wanted her not to get too lost to
<b>Floyd</b> | start with. This portion of the game was my experimenting with Inform
<b>Floyd</b> | and I decided to leave it in after several revisions. Incidentally, my
<b>Floyd</b> | wife has never played the game.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 2. Gold Watch
<b>Floyd</b> | The gold watch was a Christmas present I gave my wife. Since she was
<b>Floyd</b> | the protagonist in the experimental version, it was the only
<b>Floyd</b> | motivation I could contrive at the time.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | 3. Deadeye Gulch
<b>Floyd</b> | The buildings and so forth in Deadeye Gulch are a combination of my
<b>Floyd</b> | recollections of Deadwood, South Dakota and Virginia City, Montana.
<b>Floyd</b> | The rosewood bar in the Saloon is based on the "Silver Dollar" in
<b>Floyd</b> | Miles City, Montana.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | 4. Chokecherry Bushes
<b>Floyd</b> | Chokecherry bushes are a staple of the Montana landscape. The small
<b>Floyd</b> | black berries are somewhat tart and are especially good when canned.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 5. Willow Tree
<b>Floyd</b> | The willow tree in the story was based on a willow tree across the

<b>Floyd</b> | street from where I grew up. The tree was in Fred Dorn's yard at the
<b>Floyd</b> | time, and was recently cut down since it was dying from old age.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 6. Trystanium & Tombstone Jay
<b>Floyd</b> | Trystanium is named after and based on my nephew Tristan. The
<b>Floyd</b> | Tombstone Jay is named after my nephew TJ. Both are great kids who

<b>Floyd</b> | helped test the game along with their dad, who is "John Bro" in the
<b>Floyd</b> | story.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 7. Gold Nugget
<b>Floyd</b> | The gold panning bit was based on my brother's attempt to make his
<b>Floyd</b> | fortune when we were on vacation in Deadwood years ago. For the

<b>Floyd</b> | record, he did manage to find a few flakes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 8. Slot Machine
<b>Floyd</b> | The slot machine puzzle is based on a 5th grade homework problem
<b>Floyd</b> | provided by one of my co-workers. We spent a lot of time fooling
<b>Floyd</b> | around with this puzzle at the office.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 9. Tombstone
<b>Floyd</b> | The tombstone at Boot Hill is based on a tombstone found on a small
<b>Floyd</b> | island at Canyon Ferry, Montana.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 10. Clear Creek

<b>Floyd</b> | Clear Creek is a little stream that runs across my uncle's farm in
<b>Floyd</b> | Montana. In addition to many other adventures, this is where I had my
<b>Floyd</b> | first introduction to a rattlesnake.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game was for me the ultimate adventure in just trying to put it
<b>Floyd</b> | together and complete it. It took the better part of 18 months to
<b>Floyd</b> | write. Having really no programming experience of this nature, even
<b>Floyd</b> | the simplest things seemed to take forever. The feedback I have

<b>Floyd</b> | received on the game has been well beyond anything I could have
<b>Floyd</b> | imagined. I would like to thank each of you folks who took a moment
<b>Floyd</b> | and dropped me a note. It made the whole project worthwhile.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As a long-time fan of interactive fiction, it was a discovery of a
<b>Floyd</b> | lifetime to find the tools and documentation to even attempt this

<b>Floyd</b> | story. Accordingly, I would like to give special thanks to Graham
<b>Floyd</b> | Nelson for his incredible work. I cannot comprehend the amount of time
<b>Floyd</b> | and commitment it took to develop Inform.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Next on the list, no game would be complete without recognizing the
<b>Floyd</b> | pioneering work of Willie Crowther and Don Woods. The original

<b>Floyd</b> | Adventure was nothing short of amazing to me when I played it on a
<b>Floyd</b> | XEROX Sigma 7 about 20 years ago. I didn't finish the game until the
<b>Floyd</b> | early 80's on my C64. What a thrill!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Of course, the folks at Infocom really cut the cake for me. The thrill
<b>Floyd</b> | of getting a disk drive for my C64 and Zork I on the same day was

<b>Floyd</b> | nothing short of orgasmic. Getting so much entertainment into 80k of
<b>Floyd</b> | memory is truly one of the major accomplishments of the computer age.
<b>Floyd</b> | My favorite game to this day is Enchanter.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And speaking of thrills, the day I found the interactive community out
<b>Floyd</b> | on the Net was nothing short of a religious experience. So many good

<b>Floyd</b> | folks with a common interest. I thank you all for keeping the art
<b>Floyd</b> | alive.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Last of all, I'd like to thank my brother. He introduced me to
<b>Floyd</b> | Adventure and we played pretty much most of the I-F games together,
<b>Floyd</b> | although geographically never in the same place. And, accordingly,

<b>Floyd</b> | this game is dedicated to him.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And speaking of dedication, my heart goes out to all of you folks who
<b>Floyd</b> | play I-F. If you were patient enough to complete the game, please let
<b>Floyd</b> | me know at the e-mail address listed when you type 'HELP' in the game.
<b>Floyd</b> | Thank you so much, and God bless.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And finally, long live George and Beetlebaum!
