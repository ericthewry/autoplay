NightFloyd Transcript:<BR><B><I>Scavenger</I> by Quintin Stone</b></FONT><FONT FACE='arial, sans-serif, helvetica' SIZE='1'></BR>As played on ifMUD on September 14, 2011</FONT></P><P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2">Like ClubFloyd, the idea behind NightFloyd is that a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</BR></BR>Unlike ClubFloyd, NightFloyd often (but not always) takes on significantly larger works of interactive fiction, knowing going in that each one will take multiple sessions.  NightFloyd is also a bit more informal than ClubFloyd in that it's only announced on the ifMUD #clubfloyd bulletin board, and the time shifts around to meet player's schedules far more than ClubFloyd does.  NightFloyd is organized by genericgeekgirl, aka Adri.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Scavenger</i>, written by Quintin Stone.  <I>Scavenger</I> was released as part of the 2003 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took third place.  It was nominated for Xyzzies for Best Game, Best Puzzles, and Best Individual NPC.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Scavenger'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</BR></BR>(And in case you're wondering, yes, there are two <I>Scavenger</I> transcripts on this site; ClubFloyd played it in 2009, but NightFloyd chose to revisit it in 2011.)</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | Every scavenger dreams of that one discovery that will grant riches

<b>Floyd</b> | Howe Street, Arcadia
<b>Floyd</b> | The few street lights that still work on this run down section of road
<b>Floyd</b> | do little to dispel the everpresent gloom of the city.  Even in the
<b>Floyd</b> | middle of the day the sun is barely more than a faint glow in the thick
<b>Floyd</b> | clouds above.  The street itself is ancient crumbling asphalt; they
<b>Floyd</b> | simply don't maintain the roads this far from the city core.  This one
<b>Floyd</b> | heads north, back towards your meager home, and south, out of the city.
<b>Floyd</b> | A cross street leads east towards CyTek Corporation's main compound,
<b>Floyd</b> | and a small merchant shop you know well sits among derelict buildings
<b>Floyd</b> | to the west.

<b>Floyd</b> | RE:  Base security
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lieutenant,
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The current performance of the overall base security is unacceptable.
<b>Floyd</b> | As you know, last week a civilian was found within the base perimeter
<b>Floyd</b> | while Lieutenant Leach's squad was on guard duty.  She has been
<b>Floyd</b> | reassigned to an Alaskan supply depot where the effects of her
<b>Floyd</b> | incompetence will be of less importance.  Yesterday I was informed by
<b>Floyd</b> | Dr.  Hill that our network had been accessed by an unauthorized person
<b>Floyd</b> | from off site.  This finally gave me the justification I needed to
<b>Floyd</b> | sever our network from the rest of the outside world.  The general
<b>Floyd</b> | wasn't happy, but he couldn't deny the necessity.  Please have your
<b>Floyd</b> | people search their respective project files for any signs of
<b>Floyd</b> | unauthorized access or tampering.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And Dr.  Rock informed me that you're again using your last name as
<b>Floyd</b> | your password.  This practice is inexcusably insecure and if it happens
<b>Floyd</b> | again, you'll be digging trenches in Alaska.

<b>Floyd</b> | 2060-08-25     Corporal Jacob
<b>Floyd</b> |    A civilian penetrated the base perimeter before being spotted by a
<b>Floyd</b> | passing tech and reported to security.  Colonel Miles has had
<b>Floyd</b> | Lieutenant Leach reassigned for this failure in security.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 2060-09-20     Sergeant Herbert
<b>Floyd</b> |    A company of renegade troops passing nearby caught sight of the base
<b>Floyd</b> | perimeter and advanced on the base.  The 83rd Armored engaged them and
<b>Floyd</b> | drove them back, but took heavy casualties.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 2060-10-11     Sergeant Herbert
<b>Floyd</b> |    Official word's come in that another base in NM has fallen to the
<b>Floyd</b> | rebels.  Rumors have it that their base commander went over to the
<b>Floyd</b> | other side.  The Colonel has ordered now that speech even somewhat
<b>Floyd</b> | sympathetic to the rebel cause is grounds for court martial and
<b>Floyd</b> | immediate execution for treason.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 2060-10-20     Major Tuco
<b>Floyd</b> |    The owrd just came ocver the radio.  Edgar gave THE ORDER.  oh god I
<b>Floyd</b> | camn't bleieve this oh god oh god oh god
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 2060-12-09     Captain Ramirez
<b>Floyd</b> |    We're out of food and supplies.  Major Tuco has vanished.  Colonel
<b>Floyd</b> | Miles is dead.  Private Robinson went crazy when the Colonel refused to
<b>Floyd</b> | discuss the idea of leaving the base.  Shot him right in front of
<b>Floyd</b> | everyone.  The others killed her right after she did it.  Now we have
<b>Floyd</b> | no choice.  We hve to leave and see if there's anything left.  Can
<b>Floyd</b> | there be?  Can there be anything left?  Anyone alive?  The radio's been
<b>Floyd</b> | dead since it all happened.  We will be too if we don't leave soon.
<b>Floyd</b> | Mother of God.

<b>Floyd</b> | Once pristine stainless steel has become soiled by the dirty boots of

<b>Floyd</b> | facility.  However, new occupants have been less than fastidious in

<b>Floyd</b> | numerous scuff marks, gouges and, in several places, lewd and explicit
<b>Floyd</b> | graffiti.  The hallway continues east and west, with an exit north and

<b>Floyd</b> | is a small panel.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your Geiger counter chitters quietly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now your consciousness seems to expand.  More oily recesses of emotion,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The idea that you've discovered a device to read minds from a distance
