The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Halothane</i>, written by Ravi&nbsp;Rajkumar.  <i>Halothane</i> was originally released as part of the 1999 IF Competition, where it took sixth place. You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/608"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.</br>

</br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing these games, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played these games, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | You'll never really know how it all started.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | That's not surprising, because you're not even sure what happened in
<b>Floyd</b> | the first place. If it had been anything else, you would have dismissed

<b>Floyd</b> | it as ninety-nine per cent bad digestion and one percent fancy, much as
<b>Floyd</b> | Ebenezer Scrooge would have. Somehow, in this case, that explanation
<b>Floyd</b> | doesn't really grab you. Did it really mean anything? Or was it, as the
<b>Floyd</b> | physiologists would say, just a matter of a few neurons in your
<b>Floyd</b> | brainstem working overtime?
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | But life is strange. It's almost impossible to predict - as Heisenberg
<b>Floyd</b> | pointed out - where exactly you might end up, even when you start in as
<b>Floyd</b> | mundane a place as your own home....
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your Bedroom
<b>Floyd</b> | This is hardly the place for an adventure to begin. You know the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Antechamber, in the Aviators Saloon
<b>Floyd</b> | From the discreet signs declaring that you are currently in the

<b>Floyd</b> | obviously the reception room or antechamber of a small hotel. The doors
<b>Floyd</b> | of the hotel, to your north, seem to be closed, east is a dining-hall,
<b>Floyd</b> | and a staircase leads up. The check-in counter stands in front of you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You still remember the saloon from the day it was created. By you, of

<b>Floyd</b> | course. The jolly old receptionist, the reunion of scientist Janus
<b>Floyd</b> | Mbelwe with his wife Vanessa. It doesn't look the same now.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | An amiable, elderly man is standing behind the counter.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The receptionist stares at you in amazement. "A customer? Thought I'd

<b>Floyd</b> | Sensible. Not superstitious. That's why, I guess, we were all so scared
<b>Floyd</b> | when it happened."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He pauses, and clears his throat a tad dramatically.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Five years ago, son", he goes on, "- actually four and nine, but who's

<b>Floyd</b> | counting? - this place used to be fairly bursting with life. Not that
<b>Floyd</b> | it was one of those old-fashioned bawdy houses or burlesques or
<b>Floyd</b> | whatchamacallits - it was a nice, cosy kind of hotel, with all kinds of
<b>Floyd</b> | people. We used to have refugees from the Kingdoms, travellers from the
<b>Floyd</b> | airports, even the Director of Social Sciences and his.. - heck, that's
<b>Floyd</b> | how the whole story started. Janus Mbelwe - everyone used to call him

<b>Floyd</b> | by his first name, self included - was one of our finest scientists;
<b>Floyd</b> | social scientists, that is. Between him and a few of his friends, he'd
<b>Floyd</b> | defused a very tricky political crisis, two years ago, relying on sheer
<b>Floyd</b> | scientific method. All this at thirty."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He sighs.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, he had been here two years before that; at 'round the same time,
<b>Floyd</b> | I guess, there was a young lady staying here. I forgot what she did - I
<b>Floyd</b> | gather she was a psychologist of some sort. Anyway, she and the
<b>Floyd</b> | Director hit it off just fine - a few of us old fogies thought
<b>Floyd</b> | something might come of it, but old Jan - he was myopic if there ever

<b>Floyd</b> | was one. Couldn't see a thing - science excluded - even when it stared
<b>Floyd</b> | him in the eyes. Anyway, they met again - I can't swear that it was
<b>Floyd</b> | coincidence - the next year, and, to use the language of the novelists,
<b>Floyd</b> | they just about made a match of it. There was work to be done -
<b>Floyd</b> | political stuff - so they decided to wait for about a year or so. The
<b>Floyd</b> | next year arrived, and Vanessa Clarke - that was her name - came along

<b>Floyd</b> | at just the usual time. Jan arrived two days later, and they were all
<b>Floyd</b> | set to tie the knot, if you know what I mean. On the night before they
<b>Floyd</b> | left for the Registry for the official ceremony, old Jan was just a
<b>Floyd</b> | trifle tardy, and Miss Clarke was growing impatient. I decided to go
<b>Floyd</b> | and ask the kid to hurry up - they'd already waited so long, y'know -
<b>Floyd</b> | so I went up to his room, opened the door, and there he was.

<b>Floyd</b> | Or rather wasn't.
<b>Floyd</b> | Janus Mbelwe had vanished into thin air."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, I won't insult your intelligence by telling you that Miss Clarke
<b>Floyd</b> | was - uh - rather broken up over the whole thing; no one ever heard of
<b>Floyd</b> | her to this day, and all our searches for Jan - we even had the whole

<b>Floyd</b> | police force scouring the globe at one stage - came to naught. Ever
<b>Floyd</b> | since then, son - until you, that is - no man or woman has crossed the
<b>Floyd</b> | threshold of this saloon. That's the whole story." The receptionist
<b>Floyd</b> | closes his eyes, remembering.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I haven't even looked through the rooms since then - they stay clean

<b>Floyd</b> | automatically - but if you want to stay here, there are 'bout ten rooms
<b>Floyd</b> | upstairs. You're welcome to any of 'em."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 1. Technical Specifications:
<b>Floyd</b> | AutoLock Portable Furniture uses 1024-bit technology, S3 scale
<b>Floyd</b> | miniaturization, and voice modulation. Two models exist: the DSX - 275
<b>Floyd</b> | and the DSX - 550.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | 2. The DSX - 275 and 550:
<b>Floyd</b> | The DSX - 275, a simple and lighter model, is a low-syntax machine,
<b>Floyd</b> | with zero linguistic comprehension, and easy replaceability. The DSX -
<b>Floyd</b> | 550, though far more complex, uses S2.5 scale miniature circuits. It
<b>Floyd</b> | understands over twenty English phrases, and can also serve as a
<b>Floyd</b> | timepiece.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 3. Locking and Unlocking:
<b>Floyd</b> | Locking and unlocking are dependent on a numerical code whose length is
<b>Floyd</b> | dependent on the user, though it must lie between three and seven
<b>Floyd</b> | digits. The syntax to open the table for the DSX - 275 is "&lt;Name&gt;, the

<b>Floyd</b> | code is &lt;Code Number&gt;", where &lt;Name&gt; is the name of the piece of
<b>Floyd</b> | furniture (table, dresser, mirror, etc.) and &lt;Code Number&gt; is
<b>Floyd</b> | self-explanatory. The DSX - 550 recognizes additional formats.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 4. Changing the Code:
<b>Floyd</b> | The code can only be changed with another code number, and requires
<b>Floyd</b> | technical assistance. This feature is not recommended for beginners.

<b>Floyd</b> | Little is known about the world of 2187 A.D., which has given rise to

<b>Floyd</b> | were signs of a stability that was long awaited following the events of

<b>Floyd</b> | chambers of the Regional Court of Offences at 9 p.m., about three weeks
<b>Floyd</b> | ago. In a statement issued to all major news services, Officer Schultz

<b>Floyd</b> | of the European Police Force categorically ruled out a deep political
<b>Floyd</b> | plot as the cause of the abduction. "We live in peaceful times
<b>Floyd</b> | nowadays, and even the most obdurate reactionaries have learnt the

<b>Floyd</b> | able to retrieve Mrs. Anderson safely.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The window is open, flooding the room with sunlight.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Covering the bed, with a primness that is almost Victorian, is a warm
<b>Floyd</b> | quilt of knitted wool, which shows an unsightly bulge at one point.

<b>Floyd</b> | Dear Vanessa,

<b>Floyd</b> | even the consolation - pardon my grandiosity - of a fond farewell. I

<b>Floyd</b> | traces. Not too explicitly, of course - Nash is a fine old man, but I
<b>Floyd</b> | wouldn't want to involve him in this - but I am sure you will find a
<b>Floyd</b> | way. The key can be revealed in the usual way: table, place. There is
<b>Floyd</b> | little time to say more. Four digits alone.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Yours,

<b>Floyd</b> | Janus.

<b>Floyd</b> | ---- STUNNING EXPOS? BURIES CHARLESTOWN POLITICIANS ---
<b>Floyd</b> | From Our Special Correspondent
<b>Floyd</b> | The corrupt, brutal and unnatural orphanage of Charlestown has, through
<b>Floyd</b> | the miraculous intervention of Mr. Joel Sweeney, television

<b>Floyd</b> | personality, been all but routed. Although the sickening practices of
<b>Floyd</b> | the local politicians were known to many, few apart from the valiant
<b>Floyd</b> | Mr. Sweeney were willing to confront them face to face. "I do not give
<b>Floyd</b> | a cosmic egg", he told our reporter, "if the children in our
<b>Floyd</b> | institutions are well-treated; such yardsticks belong to the Middle
<b>Floyd</b> | Ages. Any system of education and development that does not liberate

<b>Floyd</b> | the inner self, and offer a holistic approach to spiritual development,
<b>Floyd</b> | is a monstrosity and a perversion." On the evidence of Mr. Sweeney,
<b>Floyd</b> | over 650 children - half of them orphans - were rescued from these dens
<b>Floyd</b> | of skepticism and placed along the right path. His close associate and
<b>Floyd</b> | friend, Doctor Osborne Sharma (the author of "Ingest, Assimilate,
<b>Floyd</b> | Absorb" and "Ageless Mind Over Ageing Matter") is actively involved in

<b>Floyd</b> | the process of rehabilitation.

<b>Floyd</b> | Workhouse, in Charlestown
<b>Floyd</b> | From its attitude of desolation, from its decrepit appearance, you
<b>Floyd</b> | realize that this cannot be anything other than that despised
<b>Floyd</b> | institution, the workhouse. Strangely, no cries, no disturbing sounds,
<b>Floyd</b> | can be heard though you strain your ears, and though the place is
<b>Floyd</b> | deserted and disused, there are no signs of outright squalor. The

<b>Floyd</b> | furniture is of surprisingly good quality, though probably second-hand,
<b>Floyd</b> | and there is nothing creaky about the floor-boards as you tread on
<b>Floyd</b> | them. The passage you came through leads north, and another corridor
<b>Floyd</b> | seems to leads east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Merging with the floor is a closed wooden door, probably leading to a

<b>Floyd</b> | cellar, an eerie light gleaming at its edges.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Europe, July 14th, 2883.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Dear Vanessa,
<b>Floyd</b> | Unforseen circumstances have forced me, without any sensible or
<b>Floyd</b> | honourable alternative, to leave you abruptly, without warning, without

<b>Floyd</b> | even the consolation - pardon my grandiosity - of a fond farewell. I
<b>Floyd</b> | have not been permitted to reveal more than this, even to you whom I
<b>Floyd</b> | could trust above anyone else, dearest - for the hand and mind that
<b>Floyd</b> | drive me at this moment are not my own. Rest assured that, if you still
<b>Floyd</b> | - regardless of your own safety - want to follow me, I have left enough
<b>Floyd</b> | traces. Not too explicitly, of course - Nash is a fine old man, but I

<b>Floyd</b> | wouldn't want to involve him in this - but I am sure you will find a
<b>Floyd</b> | way. The key can be revealed in the usual way: table, place. There is
<b>Floyd</b> | little time to say more. Four digits alone.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Yours,
<b>Floyd</b> | Janus.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Bizarre, indeed.

<b>Floyd</b> | ---- STUNNING EXPOS? BURIES CHARLESTOWN POLITICIANS ---
<b>Floyd</b> | From Our Special Correspondent
<b>Floyd</b> | The corrupt, brutal and unnatural orphanage of Charlestown has, through
<b>Floyd</b> | the miraculous intervention of Mr. Joel Sweeney, television

<b>Floyd</b> | personality, been all but routed. Although the sickening practices of
<b>Floyd</b> | the local politicians were known to many, few apart from the valiant
<b>Floyd</b> | Mr. Sweeney were willing to confront them face to face. "I do not give
<b>Floyd</b> | a cosmic egg", he told our reporter, "if the children in our
<b>Floyd</b> | institutions are well-treated; such yardsticks belong to the Middle
<b>Floyd</b> | Ages. Any system of education and development that does not liberate

<b>Floyd</b> | the inner self, and offer a holistic approach to spiritual development,
<b>Floyd</b> | is a monstrosity and a perversion." On the evidence of Mr. Sweeney,
<b>Floyd</b> | over 650 children - half of them orphans - were rescued from these dens
<b>Floyd</b> | of skepticism and placed along the right path. His close associate and
<b>Floyd</b> | friend, Doctor Osborne Sharma (the author of "Ingest, Assimilate,
<b>Floyd</b> | Absorb" and "Ageless Mind Over Ageing Matter") is actively involved in

<b>Floyd</b> | the process of rehabilitation.

<b>Floyd</b> | At the other end is a single bed - and a small chamber, not exactly an

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Good evening, Mrs. Anderson - Cassandra - I knew you would come. I

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Absolutely", you reply, drily.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Good luck, Cassie", she says. The little girl waves behind the glass -
