The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Unnkulia One-Half</i>, written by D. A. Leary.  <i>Unnkulia One-Half</i> was originally released in 1993. You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/230"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.</br>

So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    It's been a horrible day - no, a horrible week.  And you were so
<b>Floyd</b> | looking forward to starting work as an Acme salesman!  All through your
<b>Floyd</b> | childhood, growing up in the great cities of the north, you'd admired
<b>Floyd</b> | the salesmen with their spiffy mauve suits and bright orange ties.
<b>Floyd</b> | You'd waited eagerly for the day when you'd be handed your first sample

<b>Floyd</b> | Dam Tastee Cheez Kee, and your first customer would fork over his
<b>Floyd</b> | hard-earned cash for Acme products.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    But you didn't think your bosses would send you down here, to this
<b>Floyd</b> | backwater near the Valley King's Underworld, right on the border with
<b>Floyd</b> | dread Unnkulia.  And you certainly didn't expect those demons to waylay

<b>Floyd</b> | you en route - and you certainly didn't foresee the horrors they'd
<b>Floyd</b> | subject you to in their caverns before releasing you.  (Shudder - you
<b>Floyd</b> | don't even like remembering.  Perhaps that's the subject of another
<b>Floyd</b> | game...)  And you really didn't expect to have to work out of the
<b>Floyd</b> | Golden Dragon Inn.  And to top it all off, a bad-tempered warrior just
<b>Floyd</b> | returned a can of Acme Snayk Rhepellant and asked for his money back.

<b>Floyd</b> | You'll get heck from your supervisor when you get back, but what could
<b>Floyd</b> | you have done?  None of these damn - oops, dam - Acme products work.
<b>Floyd</b> | You've grown quite disillusioned with the whole affair.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    To make matters even worse, you haven't seen the bartender for over
<b>Floyd</b> | an hour. He wandered off into the back room and never returned.

<b>Floyd</b> | Alcohol's the only thing that makes living in the Forest of Radeekal
<b>Floyd</b> | bearable - perhaps you ought to go and find the man -

<b>Floyd</b> | In the Inn

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You're seated at the only table in the Golden Dragon Inn, a real
<b>Floyd</b> | dump in the middle of the Radeekal Forest.  It's decorated in earth
<b>Floyd</b> | tones - not a mauve or orange speck in sight!  (If you were in charge,
<b>Floyd</b> | you'd make this place a lot more snazzy.)
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |    The inn has been your base of operations for the past few days -
<b>Floyd</b> | your boss wouldn't even spring for an office.  Well, by golly, you'll
<b>Floyd</b> | show him!  Even though most of your samples have been stolen, you've
<b>Floyd</b> | still got a few choice items to hock to the gullible locals.  These
<b>Floyd</b> | Valley folk are real hicks - they'll buy anything!
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |    There's not much of interest here.  A mahogany bar lines one wall,
<b>Floyd</b> | but besides that, and the lone table and chair, this hellhole doesn't
<b>Floyd</b> | have much to offer.  The exit to the inn is to the west, and there's an
<b>Floyd</b> | open doorway leading to the back room to the northeast.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    An egg is sitting on the mahogany bar.

<b>Floyd</b> | trees, and a wide road runs due north.  The inn's open doorway stands
<b>Floyd</b> | to the east.  Above the door, a hand-painted sign swings back and
<b>Floyd</b> | forth, creaking in the cool autumn breeze.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Suddenly, a familiar-looking Valley Warrior walks up the path to the
<b>Floyd</b> | southwest.  The warrior gazes at you through sorrowful eyes.  "You poor
<b>Floyd</b> | fellow," he murmurs.  "I've just completed 'Unnkulia Zero,' and the
<b>Floyd</b> | things I found out about you - hoo boy!"  He smiles a sympathetic
<b>Floyd</b> | smile.  "Here.  I've completed my quest.  Maybe this stuff can help."

<b>Floyd</b> | He tosses you a pickaxe and a yellow ball, which you clumsily catch.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Take care of yourself."  With that, the warrior strides northward,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    This room is dominated by an enormous iron gate which blocks a wide
<b>Floyd</b> | hallway to the north.  The gate is made from thick iron bars, and looks
<b>Floyd</b> | quite sturdy; I doubt you could squeeze through it.  Other passages run
<b>Floyd</b> | northeast, northwest, and west.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Twisting Passage
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You're at a bend in a low tunnel.  The rocks seem to bear down over
<b>Floyd</b> | you, as if trying to crush you into the floor, and the floor is
<b>Floyd</b> | irregular, damp, and slippery.  Somebody's been defacing the wall here

<b>Floyd</b> | with red graffiti - how rude! The least they could do is use a more
<b>Floyd</b> | pleasing color, like orange or mauve.  [4]  You could continue to the
<b>Floyd</b> | southeast or the east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Natural Cave
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |    You're standing in a natural cave that probably hasn't been entered
<b>Floyd</b> | in years.  Twisted rock formations in the high ceiling drip water on
<b>Floyd</b> | your head, and the pale green light of your whiffleball casts dark
<b>Floyd</b> | shadows into the corners of the cave.  A narrow passage climbs up to
<b>Floyd</b> | the northeast, while an identical one climbs down to the southeast.
<b>Floyd</b> | There's also a low tunnel leading northwest.  A wider but equally low

<b>Floyd</b> | passage runs due south, and to the west is the opening in the brick
<b>Floyd</b> | wall that leads back to the cellar of the Golden Dragon Inn.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Wine Cellar
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You're in what appears to be the inn's wine cellar.  A huge cask

<b>Floyd</b> | stands against the north wall, and the air is damp and musty.  An empty
<b>Floyd</b> | wine-rack lines the south wall.  The eastern wall is brick, but the
<b>Floyd</b> | western wall is solid stone; the inn must have been built over a gash
<b>Floyd</b> | in the earth, and brick used to shore up the foundation on the open
<b>Floyd</b> | sides.  A stairway climbs up to the inn.  A sizable hole has been
<b>Floyd</b> | bashed through the brick wall, revealing a dark space to the east.

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |    You're in a small, square chamber that's obviously been carved from

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    There's a thin little man here, leaning against the wall and chewing
<b>Floyd</b> | a piece of straw.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    The man's eyes narrow speculatively.  "You look like a person in
<b>Floyd</b> | need of something - perhaps this glittering bauble might come in handy,

<b>Floyd</b> | hmm?"  He holds up a silver key.  You reach for it, but he pulls it

<b>Floyd</b> | Chamber of the Padlock
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    This cavern is wide and high, and the walls appear to have been
<b>Floyd</b> | worked and shaped.  The only exit is to the north.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    The southern wall is partly taken up by what appears to be an

<b>Floyd</b> | enormous padlock, made from solid gold and embedded in the wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | Though the lock itself is quite large, the keyhole in the center is
<b>Floyd</b> | quite small.  There's not much else of interest here.

<b>Floyd</b> | Natural Cave
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You're standing in a natural cave that probably hasn't been entered
<b>Floyd</b> | in years.  Twisted rock formations in the high ceiling drip water on
<b>Floyd</b> | your head, and the pale green light of your whiffleball casts dark
<b>Floyd</b> | shadows into the corners of the cave.  A narrow passage climbs up to

<b>Floyd</b> | the northeast, while an identical one climbs down to the southeast.
<b>Floyd</b> | There's also a low tunnel leading northwest.  A wider but equally low
<b>Floyd</b> | passage runs due south, and to the west is the opening in the brick
<b>Floyd</b> | wall that leads back to the cellar of the Golden Dragon Inn.

<b>Floyd</b> | Twisting Passage

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You're at a bend in a low tunnel.  The rocks seem to bear down over

<b>Floyd</b> | irregular, damp, and slippery.  Somebody's been defacing the wall here

<b>Floyd</b> | wine-rack lines the south wall.  The eastern wall is brick, but the
<b>Floyd</b> | western wall is solid stone; the inn must have been built over a gash

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |    You're just outside the Golden Dragon Inn, somewhere in the middle
<b>Floyd</b> | of the Forest of Radeekal.  It's a dazzling fall day, but you can't
<b>Floyd</b> | enjoy it; you've got work to do.  A path runs southwest through the
<b>Floyd</b> | trees, and a wide road runs due north.  The inn's open doorway stands
<b>Floyd</b> | to the east.  Above the door, a hand-painted sign swings back and

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You're standing on the south edge of a burbling stream in the middle

<b>Floyd</b> | of a peaceful wood.  A path follows the stream to the northwest and

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lost Vale

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You're standing on a soft carpet of moss and waving grasses, in the
<b>Floyd</b> | very center of a peaceful vale.  This place, though it's close to the
<b>Floyd</b> | Valley King's lands, certainly doesn't appear on any of the local maps;
<b>Floyd</b> | the dense brambles and trees that surround this place make it almost
<b>Floyd</b> | impossible to imagine that anyone's been here in years.  To the south,

<b>Floyd</b> | jutting out from the brambles, is an enormous bird's head made from
<b>Floyd</b> | dark gray stone.  The bird's beak is open, revealing a dark tunnel
<b>Floyd</b> | runnning into the rock creature's throat, directly south.  Narrow,
<b>Floyd</b> | winding trails run northwest and east through the brambles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Beak

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    This chamber is shaped like a gigantic beak, the top half sloping
<b>Floyd</b> | overhead, the floor carved to look like a huge bird's tongue.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | overall effect is quite creepy; it's a darn good thing this monstrous
<b>Floyd</b> | beak isn't part of a real bird.  A low, round passage that bears a
<b>Floyd</b> | disturbing resemblance to a throat runs back to the south, while to the

<b>Floyd</b> | north, the beak is open slightly to reveal daylight beyond.  You could
<b>Floyd</b> | probably squeeze out there as well.

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |    This chamber is shaped like a bird's gizzard.  [9]  The center of
<b>Floyd</b> | the room is a massive pile of crushed rock and debris, right where
<b>Floyd</b> | you'd stood when plucking the feather from the pedestal.  A wide, round
<b>Floyd</b> | passage runs north, and you think you can see a faint light at the end
<b>Floyd</b> | of the tunnel.  Other passages run east and west, both sloping slightly
<b>Floyd</b> | upward.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You see a silver key and a copper key here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | West Wing
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You're in a low, wide chamber.  Passages run to the east and

<b>Floyd</b> | southeast, and the wall opposite the passages tapers to a narrow point,
<b>Floyd</b> | lending the room a wing-like shape.  In fact, the stone walls appear to
<b>Floyd</b> | have been carved to resemble feathers - it's quite delicate and
<b>Floyd</b> | artistic work.  Unfortunately, you can't really take the walls with you
<b>Floyd</b> | to give to the innkeeper.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Hall of Judgment
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You're at the north end of a long north-south hall.  To the south,
<b>Floyd</b> | the hall stretches behind you, cluttered with debris but still
<b>Floyd</b> | passable.  Before you, on the north wall, is a huge bas-relief
<b>Floyd</b> | sculpture of a gigantic bird, its wings spread wide, talons curved

<b>Floyd</b> | ominously over two narrow hallways running northeast and northwest.
<b>Floyd</b> | The bird sculpture is quiet now, but you've got the feeling it's
<b>Floyd</b> | watching you.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You're walking through a wide north-south hall.  The walls are
<b>Floyd</b> | covered in intricate carvings, and strange shadows seem to reach out

<b>Floyd</b> | for you.  Rocks and debris litter the floor, impeding your progress; it
<b>Floyd</b> | looks like bits of the ceiling have fallen down from above.  You can go
<b>Floyd</b> | either north or south.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You see a mauve box and a pickaxe here.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |    The mauve box seems to contain a notched coin.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | No Gate Chamber
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    This room is dominated by the conspicuous lack of a huge iron gate
<b>Floyd</b> | blocking the hallway to the north; the gate appears to have risen into

<b>Floyd</b> | the ceiling.  Other passages run northeast, northwest, and west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You're starting feel a fuzz hungry.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Twisting Passage
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |    You're at a bend in a low tunnel.  The rocks seem to bear down over
<b>Floyd</b> | you, as if trying to crush you into the floor, and the floor is
<b>Floyd</b> | irregular, damp, and slippery.  Somebody's been defacing the wall here
<b>Floyd</b> | with red graffiti - how rude! The least they could do is use a more
<b>Floyd</b> | pleasing color, like orange or mauve.  [4]  You could continue to the
<b>Floyd</b> | southeast or the east.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Natural Cave
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You're standing in a natural cave that probably hasn't been entered
<b>Floyd</b> | in years.  Twisted rock formations in the high ceiling drip water on
<b>Floyd</b> | your head, and the pale green light of your whiffleball casts dark

<b>Floyd</b> | shadows into the corners of the cave.  A narrow passage climbs up to
<b>Floyd</b> | the northeast, while an identical one climbs down to the southeast.
<b>Floyd</b> | There's also a low tunnel leading northwest.  A wider but equally low
<b>Floyd</b> | passage runs due south, and to the west is the opening in the brick
<b>Floyd</b> | wall that leads back to the cellar of the Golden Dragon Inn.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Wine Cellar
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You're in what appears to be the inn's wine cellar.  A huge cask
<b>Floyd</b> | stands against the north wall, and the air is damp and musty.  An empty
<b>Floyd</b> | wine-rack lines the south wall.  The eastern wall is brick, but the
<b>Floyd</b> | western wall is solid stone; the inn must have been built over a gash

<b>Floyd</b> | in the earth, and brick used to shore up the foundation on the open
<b>Floyd</b> | sides.  A stairway climbs up to the inn.  A sizable hole has been
<b>Floyd</b> | bashed through the brick wall, revealing a dark space to the east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    The innkeeper is here, leaning against the cask.  He burps and looks
<b>Floyd</b> | up at you through bleary eyes.  "Oooh!"  he mutters.  "Pretty birdy!"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    It's been a horrible day - no, a horrible week.  And you were so
<b>Floyd</b> | looking forward to starting work as an Acme salesman!  All through your
<b>Floyd</b> | childhood, growing up in the great cities of the north, you'd admired
<b>Floyd</b> | the salesmen with their spiffy mauve suits and bright orange ties.

<b>Floyd</b> | You'd waited eagerly for the day when you'd be handed your first sample
<b>Floyd</b> | Dam Tastee Cheez Kee, and your first customer would fork over his
<b>Floyd</b> | hard-earned cash for Acme products.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    But you didn't think your bosses would send you down here, to this
<b>Floyd</b> | backwater near the Valley King's Underworld, right on the border with

<b>Floyd</b> | dread Unnkulia.  And you certainly didn't expect those demons to waylay
<b>Floyd</b> | you en route - and you certainly didn't foresee the horrors they'd
<b>Floyd</b> | subject you to in their caverns before releasing you.  (Shudder - you
<b>Floyd</b> | don't even like remembering.  Perhaps that's the subject of another
<b>Floyd</b> | game...)  And you really didn't expect to have to work out of the
<b>Floyd</b> | Golden Dragon Inn.  And to top it all off, a bad-tempered warrior just

<b>Floyd</b> | returned a can of Acme Snayk Rhepellant and asked for his money back.
<b>Floyd</b> | You'll get heck from your supervisor when you get back, but what could
<b>Floyd</b> | you have done?  None of these damn - oops, dam - Acme products work.
<b>Floyd</b> | You've grown quite disillusioned with the whole affair.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    To make matters even worse, you haven't seen the bartender for over

<b>Floyd</b> | an hour. He wandered off into the back room and never returned.
<b>Floyd</b> | Alcohol's the only thing that makes living in the Forest of Radeekal
<b>Floyd</b> | bearable - perhaps you ought to go and find the man -

<b>Floyd</b> | In the Inn
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You're seated at the only table in the Golden Dragon Inn, a real
<b>Floyd</b> | dump in the middle of the Radeekal Forest.  It's decorated in earth
<b>Floyd</b> | tones - not a mauve or orange speck in sight!  (If you were in charge,
<b>Floyd</b> | you'd make this place a lot more snazzy.)

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    The inn has been your base of operations for the past few days -
<b>Floyd</b> | your boss wouldn't even spring for an office.  Well, by golly, you'll
<b>Floyd</b> | show him!  Even though most of your samples have been stolen, you've
<b>Floyd</b> | still got a few choice items to hock to the gullible locals.  These
<b>Floyd</b> | Valley folk are real hicks - they'll buy anything!

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    There's not much of interest here.  A mahogany bar lines one wall,
<b>Floyd</b> | but besides that, and the lone table and chair, this hellhole doesn't
<b>Floyd</b> | have much to offer.  The exit to the inn is to the west, and there's an
<b>Floyd</b> | open doorway leading to the back room to the northeast.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |    An egg is sitting on the mahogany bar.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You're just outside the Golden Dragon Inn, somewhere in the middle
<b>Floyd</b> | of the Forest of Radeekal.  It's a dazzling fall day, but you can't
<b>Floyd</b> | enjoy it; you've got work to do.  A path runs southwest through the
<b>Floyd</b> | trees, and a wide road runs due north.  The inn's open doorway stands
<b>Floyd</b> | to the east.  Above the door, a hand-painted sign swings back and

<b>Floyd</b> | forth, creaking in the cool autumn breeze.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Suddenly, a familiar-looking Valley Warrior walks up the path to the
<b>Floyd</b> | southwest.  The warrior gazes at you through sorrowful eyes.  "You poor
<b>Floyd</b> | fellow," he murmurs.  "I've just completed 'Unnkulia Zero,' and the
<b>Floyd</b> | things I found out about you - hoo boy!"  He smiles a sympathetic

<b>Floyd</b> | smile.  "Here.  I've completed my quest.  Maybe this stuff can help."
<b>Floyd</b> | He tosses you a pickaxe and a yellow ball, which you clumsily catch.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Take care of yourself."  With that, the warrior strides northward,
<b>Floyd</b> | toward the great cities.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You're in what appears to be the inn's wine cellar.  A huge cask

<b>Floyd</b> | wine-rack lines the south wall.  The eastern wall is brick, but the
<b>Floyd</b> | western wall is solid stone; the inn must have been built over a gash

<b>Floyd</b> | in the earth, and brick used to shore up the foundation on the open

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    The innkeeper is here, leaning against the cask.  He burps and looks
<b>Floyd</b> | up at you through bleary eyes.  "Oh," he mutters.  "It's you,
<b>Floyd</b> | Tuckbucker.  I thought (URP!)  you'd left already."  He sighs and taps

<b>Floyd</b> | the cask.  "Empty.  Bummer.  Want to buy this place?"  He points at the

<b>Floyd</b> | I'll sell it to you for twenty - no, eighteen valmids."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    The Golden Dragon Inn!  It could be your very own - or, at least,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Beak
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    This chamber is shaped like a gigantic beak, the top half sloping
<b>Floyd</b> | overhead, the floor carved to look like a huge bird's tongue.  The

<b>Floyd</b> | the dense brambles and trees that surround this place make it almost

<b>Floyd</b> | impossible to imagine that anyone's been here in years.  To the south,
<b>Floyd</b> | jutting out from the brambles, is an enormous bird's head made from
<b>Floyd</b> | dark gray stone.  The bird's beak is open, revealing a dark tunnel
<b>Floyd</b> | runnning into the rock creature's throat, directly south.  Narrow,
<b>Floyd</b> | winding trails run northwest and east through the brambles.

<b>Floyd</b> |    There's a strange creature standing here, idly munching on a blade

<b>Floyd</b> | better!  This forest is magical, and surely the creature is no simple
<b>Floyd</b> | goat - it must be the mystical beast of yore!  The creature is sniffing

<b>Floyd</b> | of a peaceful wood.  A path follows the stream to the northwest and

<b>Floyd</b> | Forest Waterfall
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |    You're standing on a narrow strip of sand beside a burbling mountain
<b>Floyd</b> | pool.  Upriver, to the west, a small cascading waterfall feeds the
<b>Floyd</b> | pool, and to the east, a babbling brook stretches back into the forest.
<b>Floyd</b> | A path runs beside the stream to the southeast; there's no other
<b>Floyd</b> | passable ways to travel.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |    There's what appears to be a little girl playing by the water.  But
<b>Floyd</b> | you know better - that's no little girl!  In this magical land, she
<b>Floyd</b> | must be a water nymph!  Though you can't see for sure, there must be
<b>Floyd</b> | gills under her dress!  And it's said the fabled bicorn is a great
<b>Floyd</b> | friend of water nymphs!  Goodness, if you could lead the magical beast
<b>Floyd</b> | to the nymph, perhaps she would reward you!

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    The bicorn trots down the path, following you.  Suddenly the water
<b>Floyd</b> | nymph sees the creature, and her eyes widen.  "Ooh!"  she says.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Pretty goat!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    You're about to tell her that it's not a goat, it's a bicorn, when

<b>Floyd</b> | the beast charges, head lowered.  Curled horns meet the seat of the
<b>Floyd</b> | nymph's dress, and with a cry, the water nymph flies through the air,
<b>Floyd</b> | landing in the center of the pool.  Her plastic sieve flies up as well,
<b>Floyd</b> | bonking the bicorn on the rear end and landing on the grass.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | bicorn snorts, startled, and trots briskly off into the woods.  You
<b>Floyd</b> | wait for a few moments, wondering if the nymph will come up again, but

<b>Floyd</b> | all that greets you are a few lonely air bubbles.  Apparently, the
<b>Floyd</b> | skittish magical beast scared the poor nymph, and she's gone for good.
