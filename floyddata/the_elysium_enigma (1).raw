The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>The Elysium Enigma</i>, written by Eric&nbsp;Eve.  <i>The Elysium Enigma</i> was originally released as part of the 2006 IF Competition, where it took third place. It was also nominated for four Xyzzy Awards:  Best Individual NPC, Best Game, Best Story, and Best Puzzles.  It ultimately took the Xyzzies for Best Individual NPC and Best Game.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/2943"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.</br>

<b>Floyd</b> | About this Game
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Elysium Enigma is a relatively kind game.  It is possible to get
<b>Floyd</b> | killed or otherwise arrive at a less than ideal ending, but in such
<b>Floyd</b> | cases you can always UNDO.  It should not be possible to put the game

<b>Floyd</b> | into an unwinnable state.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You may well finish the game, or even win the game, with fewer than
<b>Floyd</b> | the maximum points (it's possible to win the game with as few as 13
<b>Floyd</b> | points, or even 12 on a second or subsequent playthrough).  If you
<b>Floyd</b> | arrive at a less than satisfactory ending with a very low score, that

<b>Floyd</b> | means that there's a lot of the game you have missed; but if you
<b>Floyd</b> | arrive at a winning ending with less than the maximum score that means
<b>Floyd</b> | you have seen the essentials but missed out on some optional extras.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It should be fairly easy to complete this game in the sense of
<b>Floyd</b> | reaching some ending, and not too hard to reach a winning ending

<b>Floyd</b> | within two hours; achieving the full score of 30 points could prove
<b>Floyd</b> | more of a challenge.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To access in-game hints directly, type HINT (or HINTS).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Conversation is important in this game, which uses the ASK/TELL

<b>Floyd</b> | method.  At any point in a conversation you can use the TOPICS
<b>Floyd</b> | commands to list topics it's currently worth asking or telling your
<b>Floyd</b> | interlocutor about.  You may find it makes for better gameplay,
<b>Floyd</b> | however, if you try asking and telling NPCs about the topics that
<b>Floyd</b> | naturally occur to you, rather than treating conversations as a kind
<b>Floyd</b> | of speech-maze to be navigated.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For further details of conversational and other commands, see the "How
<b>Floyd</b> | to Play Interactive Fiction" and "Playing this Game" menus.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To see this menu again type HELP or ABOUT (the commands are equivalent
<b>Floyd</b> | in this game).

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This post-comp release of The Elysium Enigma attempts to address some
<b>Floyd</b> | of the main criticisms expressed by the comp reviewers, insofar as it
<b>Floyd</b> | is possible to do that with relatively minor tweaks that don't affect
<b>Floyd</b> | the structure of the game.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Automatic Typo Correction
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The Elysium Enigma incorporates Steve Breslin's Spelling Corrector
<b>Floyd</b> | extension, which can correct some typos for you.  For example, if you
<b>Floyd</b> | type:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;X PLIOT
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Then, depending on context, the game may be able to correct this to:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;X PILOT
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And proceed to execute the appropriate command.  This can be very
<b>Floyd</b> | useful in correcting minor errors automatically, rather than

<b>Floyd</b> | presenting you with a parser error and the need to retype a command,
<b>Floyd</b> | but there are two things you should note about this feature:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (1) This library extension (rightly) takes a conservative approach to
<b>Floyd</b> | typo-correction, making only those corrections that are very likely to
<b>Floyd</b> | be correct, rather than risking speculative corrections that were not

<b>Floyd</b> | what the player intended.  This means that you may often find that the
<b>Floyd</b> | game does not correct a typo that looks obvious to you.  In such a
<b>Floyd</b> | case the reason is probably that the correction was not so obvious to
<b>Floyd</b> | the algorithm used by the spelling corrector; it's far better not to
<b>Floyd</b> | have the game "correct" your input to something you didn't intend and
<b>Floyd</b> | execute a command you didn't want.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (2) For this reason, no automatic typo correction occurs in
<b>Floyd</b> | conversational commands (like ASK and TELL) and other such commands
<b>Floyd</b> | where any input is potentially valid.  For example, you can ask an NPC
<b>Floyd</b> | about anything you like, so it would be highly annoying to have:
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;ASK BOB ABOUT LOVE
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "corrected" to:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;ASK BOB ABOUT MOVE

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Which might happen if "move" but not "love" is one of the words
<b>Floyd</b> | defined in the game's dictionary.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (3) Should you find this typo-correction feature more of a hindrance
<b>Floyd</b> | than a help you can disable it with the TYPO OFF command.  Use TYPO ON

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Abort on/off (for multiple commands)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Sometimes when you enter multiple commands on a single command line,

<b>Floyd</b> | the failure of one of the earlier commands renders the subsequent ones
<b>Floyd</b> | problematic or at least redundant.  For example, suppose there's a
<b>Floyd</b> | troll who won't let you go north, but you enter two NORTH commands in
<b>Floyd</b> | succession:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;N.N

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The ugly troll blocks your path with a growl.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The ugly troll blocks your path with a growl.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The second message is really superfluous, since you probably didn't

<b>Floyd</b> | mean to try to go north twice from your present location, but rather
<b>Floyd</b> | to go north then go north again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In other situations, this could be even more troubling.  Suppose you
<b>Floyd</b> | enter a command line like:
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;N.E.NE.TAKE BOTTLE.  DRINK POTION.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | If the first command fails, but travel east from your current location
<b>Floyd</b> | is possible, you could end up doing something quite different from
<b>Floyd</b> | what you intended.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | To avoid this problem The Elysium Enigma cancels any subsequent
<b>Floyd</b> | commands on a command line if one of the commands fails.  It does not
<b>Floyd</b> | however cancel the iteration of a command.  So, for example, if you
<b>Floyd</b> | entered the command:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;DROP ALL.  N

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And DROP TROUSERS failed halfway through the list of items to be
<b>Floyd</b> | dropped ("You'd better not drop your trousers in public!"), the DROP
<b>Floyd</b> | command would continue through the list of other items that might be
<b>Floyd</b> | dropped, but the NORTH command would be cancelled (since a previous
<b>Floyd</b> | command had failed).

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In most cases this behaviour will probably give better results than
<b>Floyd</b> | the normal library behaviour, but if you don't like it you can turn it
<b>Floyd</b> | off with the ABORT OFF command; all commands on the command line will
<b>Floyd</b> | then be executed even if one fails.  You can also turn it on again
<b>Floyd</b> | with an ABORT ON command, or toggle between settings with a simple

<b>Floyd</b> | ABORT command.

<b>Floyd</b> | "There, sir," the shuttle pilot points to a tiny collection of
<b>Floyd</b> | buildings nestling next to the river, "That's the town."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "That's the town!" you cry, "Are you sure, sublieutenant?"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Quite sure, sir," the pilot assures you as she checks her
<b>Floyd</b> | navigational instruments, "Which means our designated landing zone
<b>Floyd</b> | should be just the other side of that forest."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You let out a deep sigh as the shuttle carries out its final descent

<b>Floyd</b> | over the farmland and turns to sweep over the multi-coloured trees.
<b>Floyd</b> | It's not that you have any objection to walking per se, indeed the
<b>Floyd</b> | prospect of a good brisk walk on a sunny morning is rather appealing
<b>Floyd</b> | after four days cooped up in a frigate; it's being obliged to walk to
<b>Floyd</b> | this meeting just to avoid upsetting the natives' technophobic
<b>Floyd</b> | sensibilities that irritates you.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The pilot now has the shuttle under manual control; she kills the
<b>Floyd</b> | speed and drops the craft into a hollow just north of the forest.  As
<b>Floyd</b> | she finally cuts the engines she turns to you with a brisk smile.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Right, here we are, sir," she announces cheerfully.  Pointing to the
<b>Floyd</b> | south she adds, "The town should be about a quarter of an hour's walk

<b>Floyd</b> | that way.  I think I spotted a path running more or less straight
<b>Floyd</b> | through the forest, so you shouldn't have any difficulty finding it."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Thanks," you reply laconically.  You let out another sigh; but at
<b>Floyd</b> | least this shouldn't take more than a couple of hours, then you'll be
<b>Floyd</b> | away from this wretched backwater - hopefully for good.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Inside the Shuttle (sitting on the passenger seat)
<b>Floyd</b> | The inside of the shuttle is not exactly spacious; there's room for
<b>Floyd</b> | the pilot and three passengers, one beside the pilot and two behind.
<b>Floyd</b> | The seats are comfortable enough, but otherwise it's all pretty basic.
<b>Floyd</b> | There's not much in front of you except the forward window; the pilot

<b>Floyd</b> | has a bank of instruments.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The pilot is sitting next to you; she's turned to face you, as if
<b>Floyd</b> | waiting for you to speak.

<b>Floyd</b> | After the standard preamble, it goes on:
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm sorry to dump this on you, but the Federation crisis means that
<b>Floyd</b> | we've had to pull all but skeleton resources out of this sector, and
<b>Floyd</b> | you're the nearest Legion officer to hand.  As a result, we need you
<b>Floyd</b> | to include Elysium in your rounds.  It's a sensitive planet - probably
<b>Floyd</b> | one of the most sensitive settlements in the Empire - but provided you
<b>Floyd</b> | go straight in and straight out and stick strictly to these orders you

<b>Floyd</b> | shouldn't have any problems.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The purpose of your visit is simply to remind the local leadership
<b>Floyd</b> | that they are still part of the Empire and that we are still keeping
<b>Floyd</b> | tabs on them; quite literally, you're just there to 'show the flag'.
<b>Floyd</b> | To do this you'll need to make your way to the Legion office in what

<b>Floyd</b> | passes for the settlement's capital, and, once there, hoist the
<b>Floyd</b> | imperial flag above the building to show the local Elders that you're
<b>Floyd</b> | open for business.  One or more of them should then come to call on
<b>Floyd</b> | you within the hour.  When they do, be as diplomatic and courteous as
<b>Floyd</b> | possible, but otherwise keep the conversation to a minimum.  Inform
<b>Floyd</b> | them in the simplest possible terms of the nature of the Federation

<b>Floyd</b> | crisis, emphasising that the Empire will continue to guard them from
<b>Floyd</b> | intrusion. Ask them if they have anything they want to raise with you.
<b>Floyd</b> | Almost certainly they won't, apart from their standard grumbles about
<b>Floyd</b> | imperial interference.  Say as little as possible in reply beyond
<b>Floyd</b> | promising to pass their comments on.  Once you have completed this
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation get out of there as quickly as you can.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The most important thing to understand about the Elysians is that they
<b>Floyd</b> | have made a religion of technophobia.  Their idea of a paradisal
<b>Floyd</b> | society is a pre-industrial society, so try not to flaunt any
<b>Floyd</b> | technology you bring with you; the less the settlers see of any
<b>Floyd</b> | thirtieth-century technology, the better you'll get on with them.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, I cannot stress too strongly that you should on no account
<b>Floyd</b> | get involved in any of the internal affairs of Elysium, and that you
<b>Floyd</b> | should if at all possible avoid any contact with any of the settlers
<b>Floyd</b> | apart from the Elders who come to meet you.  Terrible mistakes have
<b>Floyd</b> | been made on Elysium in the past, and any problems that come up in the

<b>Floyd</b> | present must be left to officers with a deep understanding of the
<b>Floyd</b> | situation there, which does not include you.  So, get in, keep the
<b>Floyd</b> | chat nice and short, and get straight out again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I look forward to receiving your report in due course.

<b>Floyd</b> | multipurpose device that's issued to all Legion officers as standard.
<b>Floyd</b> | Despite the natives' dislike of modern technology, this is one item
<b>Floyd</b> | you're not prepared to go without - it was drummed into you at the
<b>Floyd</b> | Legion Training School that a Legion Officer's drik is an integral

<b>Floyd</b> | part of his uniform, never to be lost or surrendered under any
<b>Floyd</b> | circumstances.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The drik is vaguely dagger-shaped, with a black handle, on which are
<b>Floyd</b> | four small coloured studs, and a slightly longer "blade", a flat
<b>Floyd</b> | plastimetal strip that is not actually sharp enough to cut anything.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The drik has one further function in addition to that provided by its
<b>Floyd</b> | four studs: although you're unlikely to encounter much strange
<b>Floyd</b> | technology on Elysium, if you do encounter something you're suspicious
<b>Floyd</b> | of, pointing your drik at it may reveal something about its function.

<b>Floyd</b> | But what really strikes you is how quiet it is.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Looking around, you speculate that your shuttle has just landed in

<b>Floyd</b> | quite sharply - more sharply than you care to climb - but there seems

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm sorry to dump this on you, but the Federation crisis means that
<b>Floyd</b> | we've had to pull all but skeleton resources out of this sector, and
<b>Floyd</b> | you're the nearest Legion officer to hand.  As a result, we need you
<b>Floyd</b> | to include Elysium in your rounds.  It's a sensitive planet - probably
<b>Floyd</b> | one of the most sensitive settlements in the Empire - but provided you
<b>Floyd</b> | go straight in and straight out and stick strictly to these orders you

<b>Floyd</b> | shouldn't have any problems.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The purpose of your visit is simply to remind the local leadership
<b>Floyd</b> | that they are still part of the Empire and that we are still keeping
<b>Floyd</b> | tabs on them; quite literally, you're just there to 'show the flag'.
<b>Floyd</b> | To do this you'll need to make your way to the Legion office in what

<b>Floyd</b> | passes for the settlement's capital, and, once there, hoist the
<b>Floyd</b> | imperial flag above the building to show the local Elders that you're
<b>Floyd</b> | open for business.  One or more of them should then come to call on
<b>Floyd</b> | you within the hour.  When they do, be as diplomatic and courteous as
<b>Floyd</b> | possible, but otherwise keep the conversation to a minimum.  Inform
<b>Floyd</b> | them in the simplest possible terms of the nature of the Federation

<b>Floyd</b> | crisis, emphasising that the Empire will continue to guard them from
<b>Floyd</b> | intrusion. Ask them if they have anything they want to raise with you.
<b>Floyd</b> | Almost certainly they won't, apart from their standard grumbles about
<b>Floyd</b> | imperial interference.  Say as little as possible in reply beyond
<b>Floyd</b> | promising to pass their comments on.  Once you have completed this
<b>Floyd</b> | conversation get out of there as quickly as you can.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The most important thing to understand about the Elysians is that they
<b>Floyd</b> | have made a religion of technophobia.  Their idea of a paradisal
<b>Floyd</b> | society is a pre-industrial society, so try not to flaunt any
<b>Floyd</b> | technology you bring with you; the less the settlers see of any
<b>Floyd</b> | thirtieth-century technology, the better you'll get on with them.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, I cannot stress too strongly that you should on no account
<b>Floyd</b> | get involved in any of the internal affairs of Elysium, and that you
<b>Floyd</b> | should if at all possible avoid any contact with any of the settlers
<b>Floyd</b> | apart from the Elders who come to meet you.  Terrible mistakes have
<b>Floyd</b> | been made on Elysium in the past, and any problems that come up in the

<b>Floyd</b> | present must be left to officers with a deep understanding of the
<b>Floyd</b> | situation there, which does not include you.  So, get in, keep the
<b>Floyd</b> | chat nice and short, and get straight out again.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I look forward to receiving your report in due course.

<b>Floyd</b> | a link to a lengthy social-scientific analysis of this, but you're

<b>Floyd</b> | content with the summary, which suggests that the society has simply

<b>Floyd</b> | something of the world (though this is not to be communicated to any

<b>Floyd</b> | of past tragedies (there's a link to a file explaining this in more
<b>Floyd</b> | detail, but it turns out you don't have the security clearance to read
<b>Floyd</b> | it).  The summary ends with an instruction to all imperial personnel
<b>Floyd</b> | operating on Elysium to keep contact and interference to the bare

<b>Floyd</b> | "My initial survey of the small inhabited district of Elysium
<b>Floyd</b> | indicates that this world could well serve our interests in the event
<b>Floyd</b> | of war with the Empire.  The imperial authorities take a minimal

<b>Floyd</b> | interest in the inhabitants, and their allegiance to the Empire
<b>Floyd</b> | appears equally minimal.  Moreover, the inhabitants are unbelievably
<b>Floyd</b> | primitive in their lifestyle, and have no significant military
<b>Floyd</b> | capacity.  An invasion by a single company of our troops would suffice
<b>Floyd</b> | to conquer and hold this world.  The inhabitants could be forced into
<b>Floyd</b> | slave labour (see below) and also used as hostages against any attempt

<b>Floyd</b> | by imperial forces to retake the world.  Any slaughter of Elysians
<b>Floyd</b> | could then be represented as the consequence of a bungled imperial
<b>Floyd</b> | military operation - indications are that this would not be the
<b>Floyd</b> | Empire's first military blunder on Elysium.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Elysium has no industry beyond the bare minimum required to support

<b>Floyd</b> | their primitive farming methods.  Nevertheless, its agricultural
<b>Floyd</b> | assets would be capable of sustaining a moderate-sized Federation
<b>Floyd</b> | force if placed under Federation management and equipped with modern
<b>Floyd</b> | machinery.  Increased productivity would allow us to employ the
<b>Floyd</b> | surplus native labour thereby created in munitions factories to supply
<b>Floyd</b> | our forces; needless to say we should have to set up such factories

<b>Floyd</b> | ourselves, but the natives, though primitive, do not seem unduly
<b>Floyd</b> | stupid and could certainly be trained to work in such factories.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Such a scheme would enable us to sustain a sizeable fleet in the
<b>Floyd</b> | Elysium system indefinitely, apart from an imperial counter-attack.
<b>Floyd</b> | Holding an imperial world deep in imperial space may be of both

<b>Floyd</b> | strategic and propaganda value to us.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Whether the capture of Elysium would in fact be strategically
<b>Floyd</b> | worthwhile is beyond my brief to determine.  My initial survey
<b>Floyd</b> | indicates that it would be tactically feasible.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Two further items of intelligence need to be determined before my
<b>Floyd</b> | investigation is complete, however:
<b>Floyd</b> | (1) How often the Empire comes to check up on Elysium.
<b>Floyd</b> | (2) In what strength the Empire comes to check up on Elysium.

<b>Floyd</b> | "My initial survey of the small inhabited district of Elysium
<b>Floyd</b> | indicates that this world could well serve our interests in the event
<b>Floyd</b> | of war with the Empire.  The imperial authorities take a minimal
<b>Floyd</b> | interest in the inhabitants, and their allegiance to the Empire
<b>Floyd</b> | appears equally minimal.  Moreover, the inhabitants are unbelievably

<b>Floyd</b> | primitive in their lifestyle, and have no significant military
<b>Floyd</b> | capacity.  An invasion by a single company of our troops would suffice
<b>Floyd</b> | to conquer and hold this world.  The inhabitants could be forced into
<b>Floyd</b> | slave labour (see below) and also used as hostages against any attempt
<b>Floyd</b> | by imperial forces to retake the world.  Any slaughter of Elysians
<b>Floyd</b> | could then be represented as the consequence of a bungled imperial

<b>Floyd</b> | military operation - indications are that this would not be the
<b>Floyd</b> | Empire's first military blunder on Elysium.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Elysium has no industry beyond the bare minimum required to support
<b>Floyd</b> | their primitive farming methods.  Nevertheless, its agricultural
<b>Floyd</b> | assets would be capable of sustaining a moderate-sized Federation

<b>Floyd</b> | force if placed under Federation management and equipped with modern
<b>Floyd</b> | machinery.  Increased productivity would allow us to employ the
<b>Floyd</b> | surplus native labour thereby created in munitions factories to supply
<b>Floyd</b> | our forces; needless to say we should have to set up such factories
<b>Floyd</b> | ourselves, but the natives, though primitive, do not seem unduly
<b>Floyd</b> | stupid and could certainly be trained to work in such factories.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Such a scheme would enable us to sustain a sizeable fleet in the
<b>Floyd</b> | Elysium system indefinitely, apart from an imperial counter-attack.
<b>Floyd</b> | Holding an imperial world deep in imperial space may be of both
<b>Floyd</b> | strategic and propaganda value to us.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Whether the capture of Elysium would in fact be strategically
<b>Floyd</b> | worthwhile is beyond my brief to determine.  My initial survey
<b>Floyd</b> | indicates that it would be tactically feasible.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Two further items of intelligence need to be determined before my
<b>Floyd</b> | investigation is complete, however:

<b>Floyd</b> | (1) How often the Empire comes to check up on Elysium.
<b>Floyd</b> | (2) In what strength the Empire comes to check up on Elysium.

<b>Floyd</b> | Some Background to the Story
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The Elysium Enigma is set in the same universe as a series of novels
<b>Floyd</b> | I've been writing and re-writing for the last thirty years or so, and
<b>Floyd</b> | may well be for the next thirty, as my ideas change faster than my
<b>Floyd</b> | ability to produce something I'm satisfied with. This game does not
<b>Floyd</b> | directly intersect with the story-line of the novels, though it takes
<b>Floyd</b> | place at roughly the same time, and alludes to some of the same

<b>Floyd</b> | characters in passing.  And like the protagonist of the Elysium
<b>Floyd</b> | Enigma, the protagonist of my permanently-in-progress novels has a
<b>Floyd</b> | career in the Imperial Sovereign Legion.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In this story universe the Moltinoran Empire came into being in the
<b>Floyd</b> | 25th century as a result of a Centauran initiative to gain Moltinoran

<b>Floyd</b> | support against an aggressive neighbour.  By the thirtieth century the
<b>Floyd</b> | Empire has become the most powerful political grouping so far known to
<b>Floyd</b> | humankind.  Although far from perfect, it is basically a benign
<b>Floyd</b> | institution, with huge constitutional safeguards limiting the power of
<b>Floyd</b> | the Emperor and guaranteeing a great degree of autonomy to member
<b>Floyd</b> | worlds; even a cranky failing settlement like Elysium is largely

<b>Floyd</b> | allowed to go its own way.  By the late thirtieth century, however,
<b>Floyd</b> | the Empire has gained a rival almost equal in power, the (so-called)
<b>Floyd</b> | Free Trade Federation of Paran.  Although originally benign in intent,
<b>Floyd</b> | the Federation has been growing steadily more sinister, sliding slowly
<b>Floyd</b> | but steadily into tyranny.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | My series of novels follows the career of Simon Quiller, a young
<b>Floyd</b> | Legion officer (who later becomes something rather more than that)
<b>Floyd</b> | roughly speaking through the 2970s and on into the early 2980s, from
<b>Floyd</b> | the time that the truly sinister nature of the Federation starts to
<b>Floyd</b> | become clear (Simon Quiller is on Relda to witness the events Andrew
<b>Floyd</b> | Holt tells Petroc about), through a period of growing tension, until

<b>Floyd</b> | the situation erupts into open conflict, and the Empire is faced with
<b>Floyd</b> | the seemingly ghastly choice between fighting a war that could cost
<b>Floyd</b> | billions of lives or giving way to one of the nastiest tyrannies in
<b>Floyd</b> | human history.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In this universe, Earth (along with a few other worlds) lies between

<b>Floyd</b> | the Empire and the Federation and tries, futilely, to play the role of
<b>Floyd</b> | benevolent neutral, refusing to recognize the real threat of the
<b>Floyd</b> | Federation threat until it is too late.  Unlike Andrew Holt, who was
<b>Floyd</b> | born of aristocratic stock in the heartlands of the Empire, Simon
<b>Floyd</b> | Quiller, the hero of my novels, was born on Earth of an Earthish
<b>Floyd</b> | mother and Moltinoran father, and starts out as something of an

<b>Floyd</b> | outsider in the Empire.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Of course, after the novels get re-written a few more times, some of
<b>Floyd</b> | that may change, not least the role of Senator Charles Harcourt, whom
<b>Floyd</b> | I invented as a villain a long while back, but the nature of whose
<b>Floyd</b> | villainy I have yet to master...

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | It appears to be the diary of one Subcenturion Mark Villiers, who
<b>Floyd</b> | served as the representative of the Imperial Police Corps on this
<b>Floyd</b> | planet in the early twenty-eighth century, about a quarter of a
<b>Floyd</b> | millenium ago, when Elysium was newly colonized.  It seems that

<b>Floyd</b> | Villiers was posted here to enforce a modicum of imperial law and
<b>Floyd</b> | order on the new settlement, but that the settlers proved as difficult
<b>Floyd</b> | back then as they have done ever since.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you flick over the pages you find a series of accounts of ongoing
<b>Floyd</b> | friction between the uncooperative Elders and the increasingly

<b>Floyd</b> | frustrated Villiers.  Some of the other natives seemed to have been
<b>Floyd</b> | reasonable enough, and as Villiers's account progresses it becomes
<b>Floyd</b> | clear that he was becoming increasingly friendly with one young woman
<b>Floyd</b> | in particular, but the Elders were consistently obstructive, insisting
<b>Floyd</b> | that the maintenance of law on Elysium was their job and theirs alone,
<b>Floyd</b> | and no business of the Empire.  Even when news of some petty crime did

<b>Floyd</b> | come Villiers's way, the Elders would frustrate every attempt the
<b>Floyd</b> | subcenturion made to investigate it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the last few pages the tone becomes even darker.  Villiers
<b>Floyd</b> | apparently believed that someone - one of the settlers called Natasha
<b>Floyd</b> | with whom he had become quite friendly - had been murdered, and he was

<b>Floyd</b> | determined to bring the killer to justice.  The Elders proved
<b>Floyd</b> | particularly intransigent, denying that any crime had taken place that
<b>Floyd</b> | they weren't perfectly capable of taking care of.  It's clear from the
<b>Floyd</b> | diary that this made Villiers increasingly angry: if a murder had been
<b>Floyd</b> | committed it was clearly a matter for the imperial authorities, and
<b>Floyd</b> | all the settlers, Elders included, were duty-bound to co-operate.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the final page, the entry for July 14 2722, the diary concludes
<b>Floyd</b> | with the words, "I am now morally certain that Natasha was murdered,
<b>Floyd</b> | and I now have a pretty good idea where to find her body and the proof
<b>Floyd</b> | I need to bring her killers to justice.  Poor Natasha!  Always too
<b>Floyd</b> | much of a free spirit for this narrow little planet, and now she's

<b>Floyd</b> | paid the ultimate price for her broad-mindedness and her enquiring
<b>Floyd</b> | mind.  But I am determined to bring matters to a head, despite veiled
<b>Floyd</b> | threats from the Elders.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And now, I'm just off to follow up my latest lead; I'll fill in the
<b>Floyd</b> | details on my return."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | But it seems Subcenturion Villiers never did return, for there his
<b>Floyd</b> | account ends.
