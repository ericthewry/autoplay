						The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each
						week at a pre-arranged time, a group of
						people meet online to cooperatively play
						a game of interactive fiction.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>A Fly on the Wall, or An Appositional Eye</em> written by Nigel Jayne.
						 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting

					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing this game, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played this game, and think you might like to at some
						point, I do not recommend reading any further. Instead,
						you might want to return to the <a class="decorate" href=

<b>Floyd</b> | behind the beast's ear. Chuckling, the sasquatch takes the treasure

<b>Floyd</b> | A pirate wobbles his way to the gold, a wooden prosthesis attached to

<b>Floyd</b> | A green-skinned man with a stitch across his forehead lumbers toward
<b>Floyd</b> | you, two jumper cables swinging from his chest. Frankie bumps into
<b>Floyd</b> | Cleopatra standing next to the stage, sending her to the floor and
<b>Floyd</b> | knocking the headdress from her head. He extends his hand down to her,
<b>Floyd</b> | but she swats it away and glowers. Black Widow, a woman dressed in
<b>Floyd</b> | black with a red hourglass symbol on her back, picks up the headdress.
<b>Floyd</b> | Cleopatra snatches it back, stands, and returns to her spot beside the
<b>Floyd</b> | stage.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Frankie stops in front of you. <span class="floydstyle em">Are those batteries attached to</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">opposite sides of his neck? </span> you wonder. As Frankie speaks, his
<b>Floyd</b> | chin taps at the antenna protruding up from your forehead, and his
<b>Floyd</b> | breath suffocates your nose with alcohol. "Our whorey sister over
<b>Floyd</b> | there has sent me." He gestures erratically behind him. A nun with a
<b>Floyd</b> | hunched back bends over the punchbowl by the stage. You think he must
<b>Floyd</b> | have said "holy" sister, not "whorey."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The nun straightens and turns around to face you. She rests her cup of
<b>Floyd</b> | punch on her pregnant belly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "She told me it's your turn in the Fly Eye, Goldie," Frankie says.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Goldie? </span>you wonder. <span class="floydstyle em">My name isn't Goldie.</span> Then you
<b>Floyd</b> | realize that, despite the alcoholic soup bathing his brain, Frankie
<b>Floyd</b> | connected your costume with the eponymous horror film, Goldie being a
<b>Floyd</b> | contraction of its star's surname, Goldblum.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Frankie retreats toward Cleopatra. Arms crossed, she stands firm.
<b>Floyd</b> | Frankie stumbles away, passing Black Widow who, head cocked, watches
<b>Floyd</b> | Cleopatra.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You glance at the double doors and consider making your exit to the
<b>Floyd</b> | Fly Eye, but the nun attracts your attention. She smiles and raises
<b>Floyd</b> | her cup in salute.

<b>Floyd</b> | The nun waves to you as you begin toward the hall outside. She strides
<b>Floyd</b> | off, targeting a man with spiky white hair and wearing a lab coat. The
<b>Floyd</b> | scientist takes a few steps back and stares at the floor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You head out the double doors, descend the stairs, and enter the small
<b>Floyd</b> | room nicknamed, for tonight, the Fly Eye.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The wire frames of your wings bend as you gently lean back into the
<b>Floyd</b> | only chair in the room. The two floppy legs attached to your belt rise
<b>Floyd</b> | as you rest your hands on a table in front of a bank of monitors on
<b>Floyd</b> | the wall. The five screens receive signals from cameras in five
<b>Floyd</b> | different rooms in the mansion. Normally, these would be used for
<b>Floyd</b> | security, but tonight the Society is trying to record footage of the
<b>Floyd</b> | supernatural that will raise the eyebrows of even the most stone-faced
<b>Floyd</b> | skeptics. While you're hoping to witness such phenomena, following the
<b>Floyd</b> | exploits of any one of the costumed characters would probably be more
<b>Floyd</b> | interesting, after looking at the screens to decide which captures
<b>Floyd</b> | your attention.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The only person you know well is Gregory Hoblett, dressed as the
<b>Floyd</b> | Russian mystic and healer Grigori Rasputin, in the Laboratory on
<b>Floyd</b> | monitor 3. Everybody in the Society likes Hoblett, unlike Grigori who
<b>Floyd</b> | survived a stabbing, possible cyanide poisoning, and two point blank
<b>Floyd</b> | gunshots, only to succumb after being shot twice in the back and
<b>Floyd</b> | beaten.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The sasquatch chuckles quietly from the playroom on monitor 5, which
<b>Floyd</b> | is wired to record the electronic voice phenomena of ghostly children.

<b>Floyd</b> | Rasputin pulls away from the sasquatch. He takes in the shelves of

<b>Floyd</b> | The sasquatch doesn't seem to notice Rasputin's distress. "Pretty

<b>Floyd</b> | Rasputin glances at the chest just as the leprechaun pops out of it.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Why don't you tell us what you've heard," the sasquatch says as he

<b>Floyd</b> | Rasputin watches the dolls as he speaks. "Wayne Harrison was having a

<b>Floyd</b> | In A Fly on the Wall, or An Appositional Eye, you're represented by

<b>Floyd</b> | hotspots in the Harrison Mansion. You begin in the Soul Dancers
<b>Floyd</b> | Ballroom where music is playing, and you're likely to hear other

<b>Floyd</b> | You can watch a room by typing its monitor number   . Use LOOK (or L)

<b>Floyd</b> | won't be able to see them. Fortunately, nothing of interest occurs on
<b>Floyd</b> | the monitors when you do something other than selecting a feed, such
<b>Floyd</b> | as examining or talking. COMMANDS shows many actions recognized by the
<b>Floyd</b> | game, and you should check them if you're unfamiliar with commands

<b>Floyd</b> | A green-skinned man with a stitch across his forehead lumbers toward
<b>Floyd</b> | you, two jumper cables swinging from his chest. Frankie bumps into
<b>Floyd</b> | Cleopatra standing next to the stage, sending her to the floor and
<b>Floyd</b> | knocking the headdress from her head. He extends his hand down to her,
<b>Floyd</b> | but she swats it away and glowers. Black Widow, a woman dressed in

<b>Floyd</b> | Cleopatra snatches it back, stands, and returns to her spot beside the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Frankie stops in front of you. <span class="floydstyle em">Are those batteries attached to</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">opposite sides of his neck? </span> you wonder. As Frankie speaks, his

<b>Floyd</b> | there has sent me." He gestures erratically behind him. A nun with a

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The nun straightens and turns around to face you. She rests her cup of

<b>Floyd</b> | Frankie retreats toward Cleopatra. Arms crossed, she stands firm.

<b>Floyd</b> | She rests her cup on her belly. "I did hear some odd sounds out in the

<b>Floyd</b> | this bunch." She gestures her cup at the guests. "I'd keep an eye on
<b>Floyd</b> | them, if I were you." She laughs.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Most of the guests have congregated into small groups in which someone
<b>Floyd</b> | — or something — tries to talk over the music. Holographic dancers
<b>Floyd</b> | materialize momentarily to dip, spin, and swing their partners next to
<b>Floyd</b> | the corporeal partygoers before disappearing to continue their dance
<b>Floyd</b> | in the ethereal. You thought that Robin Hood was up on the stage, but

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle u1">Children's Possessions Playroom</span> (main floor, west wing)
<b>Floyd</b> | (watch all monitors)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Suddenly, a black-and-white blur darts from behind the clown and out
<b>Floyd</b> | the door.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Rasputin pulls away from the sasquatch. He takes in the shelves of
<b>Floyd</b> | staring dolls and puppets. He chokes, and his face blanches.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The sasquatch doesn't seem to notice Rasputin's distress. "Pretty
<b>Floyd</b> | impressive collection,    huh? You should see what's in that toybox."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Rasputin glances at the chest just as the leprechaun pops out of it.
<b>Floyd</b> | Rasputin screams and falls back into the sasquatch's arms.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You're surprised the shriek didn't shatter the monitor's screen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The leprechaun climbs out of the toybox. "You seem a bit on edge." He

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Do you guys know what happened in here?" Rasputin says.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Why don't you tell us what you've heard," the sasquatch says as he
<b>Floyd</b> | steadies Rasputin's wobbly stance.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Rasputin watches the dolls as he speaks. "Wayne Harrison was having a
<b>Floyd</b> | birthday party for his twin daughters in this room. They had cake and
<b>Floyd</b> | drinks."   His voice lowers. "Most of the kids died. Right here. The
<b>Floyd</b> | twins, too. Poisoned. People suspected Wayne's chauffeur, who was
<b>Floyd</b> | never charged. He was going to be fired for gambling and . . . doing
<b>Floyd</b> | inappropriate things in front of the kids. His son didn't get sick.
<b>Floyd</b> | That's why . . . ".
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "This place is haunted," the sasquatch says.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The leprechaun picks up a child-sized doll with red hair and a white
<b>Floyd</b> | dress. Wailing like a ghost, he shakes it at Rasputin. The mystic
<b>Floyd</b> | rushes out the door. The leprechaun grins broadly. "We can have some

<b>Floyd</b> | sasquatch follows, shaking his head.

<b>Floyd</b> | Black Widow notices a curtained off area at the far end of the room.

<b>Floyd</b> | A doll the size of a small girl is sitting on the floor next to the

<b>Floyd</b> | Outside the mansion, paramedics lift Greg into an ambulance. The
<b>Floyd</b> | resuscitation attempts by the nun may have saved his life. But from
<b>Floyd</b> | what? you know Greg wasn't shot. The bullet holes in the cape were
<b>Floyd</b> | part of the Rasputin costume, and Greg had no visible wounds.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Everyone seems to have gathered around the lights cast by the mansion
<b>Floyd</b> | and its exterior lamps. Black Widow and Cleopatra, both in tears, tell
<b>Floyd</b> | their stories to a police officer. The medicine man places his staff
<b>Floyd</b> | into the trunk of a car before finding the scientist. They talk and
<b>Floyd</b> | wait. The leprechaun watches the paramedics, but the sasquatch stares
<b>Floyd</b> | at the ground.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Someone is missing, though . . . You don't see the man in black or his
<b>Floyd</b> | gray partner.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The ambulance drives away. Cleopatra points at you, and the officer
<b>Floyd</b> | she was talking to nods. It's time to tell your story, but you can't
<b>Floyd</b> | make any reasonable connections between what happened to Greg and what
