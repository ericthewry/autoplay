The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>The Mage Wars: Statue</i>, written by Jim Fisher.  <I>The Mage Wars: Statue</I> was originally released as part of the 2003 IntroComp, where it took first place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/The_Mage_Wars:_Statue'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | statue. Although most thought it to be simply a statue of amazing
<b>Floyd</b> | detail, many believed that it was once a real man. It was a commonly
<b>Floyd</b> | told children's story that the statue was truly a dark mage who slept
<b>Floyd</b> | until his chosen time to rise again and enslave the world. It was said
<b>Floyd</b> | he was a mage of powerful evil -- more evil even than Noric the Dark
<b>Floyd</b> | who had been exiled with great difficulty into the Thanatos desert for
<b>Floyd</b> | leading an insurrection against her father. But Cylest secretly
<b>Floyd</b> | believed the statue was an ancient hero, captured by an evil mage of
<b>Floyd</b> | great power and made to suffer for all eternity. The statue was the
<b>Floyd</b> | single interest that she could always remember having, so she had
<b>Floyd</b> | jumped at the chance to visit the museum where it was housed. After the
<b>Floyd</b> | museum guide had led her party by it, she had taken the first
<b>Floyd</b> | opportunity to sneak away and return.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now, as she stood knee-high before the statue of the ancients and
<b>Floyd</b> | stared up into its heart-wrenching expression, she was ensnared by the
<b>Floyd</b> | romance of it all. The tall, mysterious, ancient man -- unloved,
<b>Floyd</b> | rejected, and distraught by loneliness -- stood waiting only for
<b>Floyd</b> | someone to love him. Yes, she thought as she peered into his sad,
<b>Floyd</b> | distant eyes. I do love him. And she always had, for the entire seven
<b>Floyd</b> | years of her life. He needed her love and she could not deny him of it.
<b>Floyd</b> | The grownups would not understand, but it didn't matter. She would
<b>Floyd</b> | prove her love...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Museum, Statue Exhibit (in the glass case)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | From within the case, sharing space with the statue, Cylest felt like
<b>Floyd</b> | an artifact herself, looking out into the empty museum.

<b>Floyd</b> |                             (circa 1997)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It had been three weeks since my spirit had died, three weeks since all
<b>Floyd</b> | the color had drained from the world, three weeks since the horror had
<b>Floyd</b> | visited and marred me forever. I had knelt amidst the wreckage of glass
<b>Floyd</b> | and metal. I had held Karen's limp form upon my lap. I had closed her
<b>Floyd</b> | unseeing eyes. It had been three weeks since my reason to live had left
<b>Floyd</b> | this world and I had kissed my wife's cold, bloodied lips goodbye.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The loss was unbearable, the pain beyond measure. I had emerged
<b>Floyd</b> | dreadfully intact from the wreckage that had once been my automobile. I
<b>Floyd</b> | was unforgivably unscathed. To those around me, I seemed healthy and
<b>Floyd</b> | vibrant. Yet I was but a shell; dead in all ways that mattered.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | From my reflection, only an obscenity glared back. The perversity of it
<b>Floyd</b> | all taunted me. Not a scratch upon the killer who drove his love to her
<b>Floyd</b> | death. Not a bruise for the driver whose very reason to live was
<b>Floyd</b> | crushed in his passenger seat.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And so it was that three weeks -- or minutes, or decades -- after the
<b>Floyd</b> | accident, I included myself in the secret. As I stared at my reflection
<b>Floyd</b> | in the coffee pot, I let myself in on the plan. As I did, I knew at
<b>Floyd</b> | once that I had made the decision weeks ago -- in the midst of the
<b>Floyd</b> | wreckage -- and kept it secret even from myself.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Teresa had said that it was too soon for me to return to work, but I
<b>Floyd</b> | had dismissed her concerns. I needed to immerse myself, I had said. But
<b>Floyd</b> | it was a lie, and Malcolm had known. He watched me closely,
<b>Floyd</b> | scrutinizing my actions. He was as suspicious as any partner and friend
<b>Floyd</b> | of twenty years would be. But today was the meeting, and he could not
<b>Floyd</b> | be in two places at once.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Today would be the day that I would realize my plan and put an end to
<b>Floyd</b> | this lifelessness...

<b>Floyd</b> | Boardroom
<b>Floyd</b> | The boardroom was elegant and lavish. The East wall was comprised of
<b>Floyd</b> | windows framing a scenic view of the cityscape. Light shined through,
<b>Floyd</b> | distilled by tinting, and illuminated the room's centerpiece, a large
<b>Floyd</b> | marble table. A windowed wall and door exhibited the hall to the West.
<b>Floyd</b> | To the South was a small coffee bar.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Two investors sat at one end of the table, their backs to the windowed
<b>Floyd</b> | door and hall.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the marble table was a cage (which was closed).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Malcolm, dressed in the sleek office attire he wore on such occasions,
<b>Floyd</b> | sat at the head of the table; a deep concern for me shown on his face.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It is real?" asked one of the two men. He was holding the life-sized
<b>Floyd</b> | statuette of a turtle in his hands. The other man looked at it over his
<b>Floyd</b> | shoulder. Both seemed to be scrutinizing it for some flaw.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yes," responded Malcolm with a chuckle. "It is as real as this one."
<b>Floyd</b> | Malcolm pulled the cloth from the cage, revealing the kitten within. It
<b>Floyd</b> | had been sleeping, but awoke at the light. The kitten began to mew as
<b>Floyd</b> | Malcolm opened the cage and reached for it.

<b>Floyd</b> | and he stroked the kitten playfully. In his left hand, he held the
<b>Floyd</b> | Petrian device.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Will it hurt?" the first man asked with a mixed expression of horror
<b>Floyd</b> | and fascination.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Not at all," replied Malcolm smiling. "The effect is instantaneous.
<b>Floyd</b> | The kitten will experience no sensation and will be unaware even of the
<b>Floyd</b> | passage of time."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "How much time?" asked the second man.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | one. It was small, about the size and shape of a portable stereo.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Malcolm moved his hand from the kitten to the Petrian device. The
<b>Floyd</b> | kitten jumped playfully and tried to pursue his hand.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then Malcolm pushed the button and the kitten froze, turning instantly
<b>Floyd</b> | to a colorless grey stone material. It fell off the table, having been
<b>Floyd</b> | frozen in mid leap, and made a loud noise as it hit the floor. The two
<b>Floyd</b> | men gasped at the fallen kitten, paying no attention to the electrode
<b>Floyd</b> | which automatically retracted to the device.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Malcolm reached down and picked the newly created statuette up from the
<b>Floyd</b> | floor and set it on the table. "If you have any questions," said
<b>Floyd</b> | Malcolm with a smug smile. "Dr. Philbrook and I will try to answer them
<b>Floyd</b> | as best we can."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;&gt;tell excuse to leave
<b>Floyd</b> | "If you will excuse me," I announced to the room. "I have something
<b>Floyd</b> | that I must attend to." Malcolm looked at me, understanding the excuse;
<b>Floyd</b> | pity showed plainly upon his face. I felt a passing twinge of guilt for
<b>Floyd</b> | abandoning him in a meeting of this importance, but apathy overwhelmed
<b>Floyd</b> | it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For a dizzy moment my vision blurred and I saw Karen's lifeless face
<b>Floyd</b> | staring into nothingness. I scrunched my eyes closed, prepared to wait
<b>Floyd</b> | until the vision passed, but it never did and I was forced to open them
<b>Floyd</b> | again and wipe the tears from my cheeks. "Excuse me," I repeated, not
<b>Floyd</b> | knowing what else to say. The two investors looked at me strangely;
<b>Floyd</b> | Malcolm smiled sympathetically and nodded, telling me without words
<b>Floyd</b> | that he could handle the investors. He turned his attention back to
<b>Floyd</b> | them.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yes," Malcolm replied. "And a very small amount of inorganic matter in

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The man thought about this silently, obviously not convinced.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "What happens if you break the statue?" one of the men asked.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "We know of nothing that can damage an eikon," Malcolm said. "The

<b>Floyd</b> | space between the atoms themselves. Our testing indicates that these
<b>Floyd</b> | stoned statues, or petra-eikons, could easily survive unscathed upon

<b>Floyd</b> | Cylest had wandered away from the others. The museum was amazing and

<b>Floyd</b> | captivating. She had listened to the stories all of her life. It was

<b>Floyd</b> | before recorded history. None knew how the statue had been made or how

<b>Floyd</b> | what it was made from. The mages claimed that it was immune to most of

<b>Floyd</b> | statue. Although most thought it to be simply a statue of amazing
<b>Floyd</b> | detail, many believed that it was once a real man. It was a commonly
<b>Floyd</b> | told children's story that the statue was truly a dark mage who slept
<b>Floyd</b> | until his chosen time to rise again and enslave the world. It was said
<b>Floyd</b> | he was a mage of powerful evil -- more evil even than Noric the Dark
<b>Floyd</b> | who had been exiled with great difficulty into the Thanatos desert for
<b>Floyd</b> | leading an insurrection against her father. But Cylest secretly
<b>Floyd</b> | believed the statue was an ancient hero, captured by an evil mage of
<b>Floyd</b> | great power and made to suffer for all eternity. The statue was the

<b>Floyd</b> | museum guide had led her party by it, she had taken the first
<b>Floyd</b> | opportunity to sneak away and return.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Now, as she stood knee-high before the statue of the ancients and
<b>Floyd</b> | stared up into its heart-wrenching expression, she was ensnared by the
<b>Floyd</b> | romance of it all. The tall, mysterious, ancient man -- unloved,
<b>Floyd</b> | rejected, and distraught by loneliness -- stood waiting only for
<b>Floyd</b> | someone to love him. Yes, she thought as she peered into his sad,
<b>Floyd</b> | distant eyes. I do love him. And she always had, for the entire seven
<b>Floyd</b> | years of her life. He needed her love and she could not deny him of it.
<b>Floyd</b> | The grownups would not understand, but it didn't matter. She would
<b>Floyd</b> | prove her love...

<b>Floyd</b> | an artifact herself, looking out into the empty museum.

<b>Floyd</b> |                             (circa 1997)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It had been three weeks since my spirit had died, three weeks since all
<b>Floyd</b> | the color had drained from the world, three weeks since the horror had
<b>Floyd</b> | visited and marred me forever. I had knelt amidst the wreckage of glass
<b>Floyd</b> | and metal. I had held Karen's limp form upon my lap. I had closed her
<b>Floyd</b> | unseeing eyes. It had been three weeks since my reason to live had left
<b>Floyd</b> | this world and I had kissed my wife's cold, bloodied lips goodbye.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The loss was unbearable, the pain beyond measure. I had emerged
<b>Floyd</b> | dreadfully intact from the wreckage that had once been my automobile. I
<b>Floyd</b> | was unforgivably unscathed. To those around me, I seemed healthy and
<b>Floyd</b> | vibrant. Yet I was but a shell; dead in all ways that mattered.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | From my reflection, only an obscenity glared back. The perversity of it
<b>Floyd</b> | all taunted me. Not a scratch upon the killer who drove his love to her
<b>Floyd</b> | death. Not a bruise for the driver whose very reason to live was
<b>Floyd</b> | crushed in his passenger seat.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And so it was that three weeks -- or minutes, or decades -- after the
<b>Floyd</b> | accident, I included myself in the secret. As I stared at my reflection
<b>Floyd</b> | in the coffee pot, I let myself in on the plan. As I did, I knew at
<b>Floyd</b> | once that I had made the decision weeks ago -- in the midst of the
<b>Floyd</b> | wreckage -- and kept it secret even from myself.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Teresa had said that it was too soon for me to return to work, but I
<b>Floyd</b> | had dismissed her concerns. I needed to immerse myself, I had said. But
<b>Floyd</b> | it was a lie, and Malcolm had known. He watched me closely,
<b>Floyd</b> | scrutinizing my actions. He was as suspicious as any partner and friend
<b>Floyd</b> | of twenty years would be. But today was the meeting, and he could not
<b>Floyd</b> | be in two places at once.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Today would be the day that I would realize my plan and put an end to
<b>Floyd</b> | this lifelessness...

<b>Floyd</b> | The boardroom was elegant and lavish. The East wall was comprised of
<b>Floyd</b> | windows framing a scenic view of the cityscape. Light shined through,
<b>Floyd</b> | distilled by tinting, and illuminated the room's centerpiece, a large
<b>Floyd</b> | marble table. A windowed wall and door exhibited the hall to the West.
<b>Floyd</b> | To the South was a small coffee bar.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Two investors sat at one end of the table, their backs to the windowed
<b>Floyd</b> | door and hall.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the marble table was a cage (which was closed).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Malcolm, dressed in the sleek office attire he wore on such occasions,
<b>Floyd</b> | sat at the head of the table; a deep concern for me shown on his face.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "It is real?" asked one of the two men. He was holding the life-sized
<b>Floyd</b> | statuette of a turtle in his hands. The other man looked at it over his
<b>Floyd</b> | shoulder. Both seemed to be scrutinizing it for some flaw.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yes," responded Malcolm with a chuckle. "It is as real as this one."
<b>Floyd</b> | Malcolm pulled the cloth from the cage, revealing the kitten within. It
<b>Floyd</b> | had been sleeping, but awoke at the light. The kitten began to mew as
<b>Floyd</b> | Malcolm opened the cage and reached for it.

<b>Floyd</b> | Both men's eyes widened as Malcolm attached the Petrian device's

<b>Floyd</b> | and he stroked the kitten playfully. In his left hand, he held the
<b>Floyd</b> | Petrian device.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Will it hurt?" the first man asked with a mixed expression of horror
<b>Floyd</b> | and fascination.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Not at all," replied Malcolm smiling. "The effect is instantaneous.
<b>Floyd</b> | The kitten will experience no sensation and will be unaware even of the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "How much time?" asked the second man.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Whatever we choose," replied Malcolm. "For this example, I've set the

<b>Floyd</b> | one. It was small, about the size and shape of a portable stereo.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Malcolm moved his hand from the kitten to the Petrian device. The
<b>Floyd</b> | kitten jumped playfully and tried to pursue his hand.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then Malcolm pushed the button and the kitten froze, turning instantly
<b>Floyd</b> | to a colorless grey stone material. It fell off the table, having been
<b>Floyd</b> | frozen in mid leap, and made a loud noise as it hit the floor. The two
<b>Floyd</b> | men gasped at the fallen kitten, paying no attention to the electrode
<b>Floyd</b> | which automatically retracted to the device.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Malcolm reached down and picked the newly created statuette up from the
<b>Floyd</b> | floor and set it on the table. "If you have any questions," said
<b>Floyd</b> | Malcolm with a smug smile. "Dr. Philbrook and I will try to answer them
<b>Floyd</b> | as best we can."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For a moment, both men were speechless. They looked at the stoned
<b>Floyd</b> | kitten -- a newly created eikon -- with obvious wonder. It was always

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | For a dizzy moment my vision blurred and I saw Karen's lifeless face

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "We know of nothing that can damage an eikon," Malcolm said. "The

<b>Floyd</b> | The lobby was a clean, almost sterile room that greeted people when

<b>Floyd</b> | the rest of the office resided down the short hallway to the North.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Teresa ruffled through the papers on her desk, performing her duties in

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Hello, Doctor Philbrook," greeted Teresa. She smiled brightly, but it
<b>Floyd</b> | was an artificial smile. I could see the concern reflected in her eyes,
<b>Floyd</b> | a concern reflected in the eyes of everyone I worked with.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I knew I should be appreciative for their concern and that it was

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It will soon be over, I thought.

<b>Floyd</b> | Perhaps it had something to do with the rumors of the supreme one's new

<b>Floyd</b> | that worked the museum by day would frown upon what he intended to do.
<b>Floyd</b> | Not that his intentions were bad.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When Cylest, his beloved, was a child, she had taken her pin -- her
<b>Floyd</b> | PROMISE pin -- and hidden it in the statue! He had laughed at her when

<b>Floyd</b> | that little girls did, he supposed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Cylest's father could certainly have managed its retrieval through the
<b>Floyd</b> | proper channels but she was set against this, claiming that it would
<b>Floyd</b> | bring her dishonor. Nortoche didn't really understand what she was
<b>Floyd</b> | talking about, but as their relationship became more serious, he began
<b>Floyd</b> | to have a vested interest in recovering the pin.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So there he was, in yet another compromising situation, this time in
<b>Floyd</b> | the name of love, preparing to break into a museum and take back a
<b>Floyd</b> | promise pin, which no one knew was there, from an ancient statue which
<b>Floyd</b> | had possessed it for almost a dozen years.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He shook his head at the craziness of it all and toyed with the globe
<b>Floyd</b> | which Cylest had procured for him despite its extreme rarity. The
<b>Floyd</b> | princess was not without her resources, he thought to himself. Nort
<b>Floyd</b> | tossed the orb playfully into the air meaning to catch it, but missed.

<b>Floyd</b> | It was the front steps of the Ancient Artifacts Museum, which was

<b>Floyd</b> | "Little is known of the person named Rehsif-Mij other than the fact
<b>Floyd</b> | that he was an ancient historian. This so-called book of Rehsif, found
<b>Floyd</b> | long ago, is the last remnant of his work and is believed to be between
<b>Floyd</b> | three and four millennia old. Only a few paragraphs in the book, on a
<b>Floyd</b> | single page, are still legible and are believed to have been written in
<b>Floyd</b> | Rehsif's native language called "Anglosh." All knowledge of "Anglosh"
<b>Floyd</b> | and the ability to translate it has been lost to modern scholars for
<b>Floyd</b> | hundreds of years. The only remaining vestibule of knowledge concerning
<b>Floyd</b> | the language is the translation of the few readable snips of text from
<b>Floyd</b> | this ancient book into a once common Darisian dialect. The translation
<b>Floyd</b> | itself, which appears below, is close to a thousand years old and bears
<b>Floyd</b> | only a vague resemblance to modern Darisian:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "...a fresh weapon unlike the collective had sight of in the previous.
<b>Floyd</b> | The weapon potentialed caustic, and when the caustic was unconstrained,
<b>Floyd</b> | there ushered not alone the departing of the Great Battle, but
<b>Floyd</b> | desolation in the escort..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "...freshly made was the All..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "...potential saturated the All in the infinitesimal and unioned
<b>Floyd</b> | within. Yoked the All to the whim of the minor count who arrayed the
<b>Floyd</b> | saturated by will; a fresh aristocracy approached..."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "...aged magiks of sionce were mislaid and overcome by the approaching
<b>Floyd</b> | of the fresh magiks arrived by the saturated All. Sionce reduced, to
<b>Floyd</b> | depart yet. The All conformed to the decree of the wyzurds..."

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | No. There it was again... It WAS moving! Panic instantly welled up

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | But at this the dark mage only took notice of him, his eyes focusing
<b>Floyd</b> | for the first time in millennia. "Don't kill me!" he cried. "Don't kill

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | His life was over, Nortoche knew. He would never again see Cylest. He

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Anger flared within the green mage and showed plainly upon his face. It
<b>Floyd</b> | was an affront to bring the pseudo mages -- the "siontysts" -- into an
<b>Floyd</b> | investigation as delicate as this. They were not mages in any sense of

<b>Floyd</b> | emerald robes while he took several deep, slow breaths to calm himself.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To the matter at hand then: the statue. The boy, Nortoche, had tripped

<b>Floyd</b> | spells. Highly improbable, but mages had been dispatched only to find
<b>Floyd</b> | that the ancient statue was indeed gone. None of the pieces to this

<b>Floyd</b> | investigating mages as to the true events.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Well Dunamei would put an end to the doubt. He held his position as

<b>Floyd</b> | vapor and appeared to solidify. The real world, in turn, became
<b>Floyd</b> | translucent and strangely dim...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The vision that formed was sharp and clear, as Dunamei expected it
<b>Floyd</b> | would be. Interesting things had happened here of late, things even the
<b>Floyd</b> | inanimate would find interesting.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The missing glass case formed. It contained the famous statue, frozen
<b>Floyd</b> | and lifeless as it had been for all of recorded history. After a few
<b>Floyd</b> | moments someone entered the room. It was Nortoche, whom had just been
<b>Floyd</b> | interviewed. Dunamei was extremely interested in what would happen
<b>Floyd</b> | next, the boy's story had been fantastic and implausible, yet spells
<b>Floyd</b> | had ensured that it was the truth as far as Nortoche believed. The mage
<b>Floyd</b> | fully expected to find some sign of trickery, perhaps an involvement of
<b>Floyd</b> | magik which the boy would not have recognized.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nortoche pulled out a golden orb. Dunamei recognized it as a magikal
<b>Floyd</b> | artifact. They allowed even commoners to cast spells, but were
<b>Floyd</b> | extremely difficult to come by. Princess Cylest could perhaps come by
<b>Floyd</b> | one, as Nortoche had said, but for political reasons her involvement in
<b>Floyd</b> | this would simply disappear as the orb did when Nortoche threw it,
<b>Floyd</b> | dispelling the ward.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The mage watched closely, now, as the boy opened the glass case and
<b>Floyd</b> | entered it, wanting to miss nothing. But Dunamei saw no sign of magik
<b>Floyd</b> | as the boy looked into the statue's face. The spell responsible for
<b>Floyd</b> | turning the statue from a grey stone color to a pink fleshy color was
<b>Floyd</b> | not obvious. The mage rubbed his eyes as the boy smashed through the
<b>Floyd</b> | glass. What had happened?
<b>Floyd</b> | Dunamei couldn't believe it. The ancient statue -- alive and mobile!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What sort of spell could have done that?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It didn't surprise Dunamei in the lEast that the statue lived after
<b>Floyd</b> | being transformed into flesh, he had long suspected there was more to
<b>Floyd</b> | it than just the unclassified rock it was made from. What few spells
<b>Floyd</b> | could provide information about the statue suggested the presence of
<b>Floyd</b> | stone organs within the stone statue. What did surprise Dunamei was
<b>Floyd</b> | that someone had been successful at transforming it into flesh.
<b>Floyd</b> | Hundreds of mages from all the guilds had tried in vain to affect the
<b>Floyd</b> | statue in any way. It had stood, impervious to magik, since it had been
<b>Floyd</b> | found, millennia ago.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then came the security spell, triggered by the smashing of the glass
<b>Floyd</b> | case. It was a flash of light which transported all living creatures
<b>Floyd</b> | from the museum and secured a perimeter around the crime scene until
<b>Floyd</b> | the mages could investigate. When the flash faded, the boy was gone,
<b>Floyd</b> | transported to a holding cell, but the statue -- the man -- remained.
<b>Floyd</b> | Even in life, the statue remained impervious to magik. Dunamei was
<b>Floyd</b> | shaken by this revelation.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As he watched the statue walk -- without even a cramp after being
<b>Floyd</b> | frozen for thousands upon thousands of years -- Dunamei could only
<b>Floyd</b> | think of Noric the exiled. Was he behind this? What evil purpose could
<b>Floyd</b> | he accomplish with this? A minion that was resistant to the mages...
<b>Floyd</b> | Dunamei shivered.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The lighting brightened and the shapes faded as the mist vanished.

<b>Floyd</b> | The statue made flesh walked into the room, unaware of Dunamei and the
<b>Floyd</b> | present world, which had faded visibly. He walked purposely over to the
<b>Floyd</b> | case, surrounded by the glowing blue aura, the protection ward. He
<b>Floyd</b> | opened the glass case, passing through the ward effortlessly, then
<b>Floyd</b> | reached in and opened the panel on the contained artifact, something
<b>Floyd</b> | the siontysts claimed endowed the ancient's with great power. They
<b>Floyd</b> | called it a "kompeutre," a type of "ma-sheen." Dunamei always
<b>Floyd</b> | considered the talk rubbish, an attempt to elevate commoners to
<b>Floyd</b> | equality with true mages. He ground his teeth at the their impudence.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There was disruption in the vision, like the blowing of vapor. It
<b>Floyd</b> | reformed, but differently. The man had split into three or four
<b>Floyd</b> | duplicates of himself, but Dunamei recognized it as a nuance of the
<b>Floyd</b> | Thespia spell (the inanimate had little understanding of linear time,
<b>Floyd</b> | and often replayed separate, closely related events simultaneously).
<b>Floyd</b> | Each of the statue doppelgangers seemed to be attaching items to the
<b>Floyd</b> | artifact in the display glass, sometimes overlapping each other like
<b>Floyd</b> | spirits. Dunamei had difficulty following what was happening. Then the
<b>Floyd</b> | duplicates united again and for just a moment, the man stood there
<b>Floyd</b> | clear as day working in some un-guessable fashion on the artifact.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Then the doorway appeared and Dunamei jumped. A collective gasp came
<b>Floyd</b> | from the mages and the pseudo-mages alike. The man had spoken no
<b>Floyd</b> | incantations. He had cast no spells. He had simply worked the
<b>Floyd</b> | "kompeutre" and the spell had been cast. Dunamei frowned. This was a
<b>Floyd</b> | disappointment. It could only serve to feed the growing insurrection of
<b>Floyd</b> | the siontysts. It could only reinforce their demands for equality. They
<b>Floyd</b> | were an enigma, these commoners who presumed themselves equal to the

<b>Floyd</b> | Museum, Peace Exhibit
<b>Floyd</b> | This was a peaceful, organic section of the museum. Potted plants
<b>Floyd</b> | rested in every corner and climbing ivy worked its way over various
<b>Floyd</b> | crevices and ledges giving a warm, natural feeling. The Northern wall
<b>Floyd</b> | was made up of sections of glass, providing a scenic view of the
<b>Floyd</b> | gardens outside. The loWest section was actually a window with a handle
<b>Floyd</b> | that could be opened. A glass display case containing an open book was
<b>Floyd</b> | featured in this area. An engraved silver plaque on the case glistened
<b>Floyd</b> | in the dim luminosity.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Several paths had been blocked off by beams of yellow light. The only

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A glowing blue field of light surrounded the glass case.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The air crackled with energy and a sharp and sudden breeze swept the
<b>Floyd</b> | room. A single silvery door appeared. It shimmered and wavered in the
<b>Floyd</b> | air for an instant then solidified. The Principal Mage recognized the
<b>Floyd</b> | Thurais spell and frowned. This could not be good. Thurais was a
<b>Floyd</b> | complex casting that opened a doorway between two locations. The burden
<b>Floyd</b> | upon the caster increased exponentially as a function of distance so
<b>Floyd</b> | the cost usually outweighed the benefit. It was used only in the direst
<b>Floyd</b> | of circumstances.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A messenger mage, clad in a scarlet robe, stepped from the door making
<b>Floyd</b> | the required, continuous gestures to keep the door open. He looked to
<b>Floyd</b> | Dunamei at once. "My lord," he began. "The council has urgent need of
<b>Floyd</b> | you. There has been an occurrence." The red mage paused, lost for a
<b>Floyd</b> | moment in concentration on his gestures, and then continued in a soft,
<b>Floyd</b> | secretive manner. "It concerns Limech," he whispered.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A prickle went up Dunamei's neck. Limech had been a friend, if mages
<b>Floyd</b> | could have friends, and a fellow member of the green order. He had been
<b>Floyd</b> | Darisia's last mole in Noric's faction, the one remaining spy. News had
<b>Floyd</b> | come of something building. Noric the Dark had apparently made a
<b>Floyd</b> | breakthrough in his forbidden works, something big. The hope of the
<b>Floyd</b> | council had been upon Limech's intelligence as to the nature of Noric's
<b>Floyd</b> | new, evil casting. Instead, they had received Limech's heart, cut from
<b>Floyd</b> | his body. Dunamei had delivered the news of Limech's demise to his
<b>Floyd</b> | widow. Her pathetic, sobbing cries continued to haunt him weeks later.

<b>Floyd</b> | already, obscuring what they crowded around. Nearest to Dunamei was
<b>Floyd</b> | Caulor the brown, his face pale and disturbed. He gnawed reflexively at
<b>Floyd</b> | his fingernails and sweat beaded across his pudgy brow. Caulor's empty,
<b>Floyd</b> | horrified eyes met the Principal Mage's. Several seconds passed before

<b>Floyd</b> | from his friend. Caulor simply stepped back giving Dunamei room. The
<b>Floyd</b> | other mages, faces drained and vacant, did the same revealing a scene
<b>Floyd</b> | which both repulsed and horrified the green mage.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It was Limech, rotting and decomposed yet standing before them, a
<b>Floyd</b> | mocking affront to Death. He seemed not to take notice of the
<b>Floyd</b> | trembling, imperial guard who held him at sword point.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "My lord," croaked the undead mage, seeing him. Limech took a hobbling
<b>Floyd</b> | step forward. The mages, all save Dunamei, recoiled. Taudorn retreated
<b>Floyd</b> | to the tree line and doubled over, vomiting. The other mages also
<b>Floyd</b> | withdrew then, most retching, leaving the lone commoner guard. Even
<b>Floyd</b> | Bremech the grey, Dunamei noted to himself with delight, bore a pale,
<b>Floyd</b> | sickly hue. The stench of decay waft across Dunamei's nostrils, turning
<b>Floyd</b> | his stomach, but the Principal Mage stood his ground staunchly before
<b>Floyd</b> | his dead friend.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Fringe of Darisia, behind gates
<b>Floyd</b> | It was the line between hell and paradise. On this side, aided by mage
<b>Floyd</b> | works, the land gave forth grass and trees, life in abundance. But just
<b>Floyd</b> | to the East, on the other side of the ancient iron fence, was a barren
<b>Floyd</b> | wasteland. The Thanatos desert stretched as far as the eye could see.
<b>Floyd</b> | Those banished by the council were sent out into the desert to die by
<b>Floyd</b> | the elements. No creature could survive there, no life whatsoever, or
<b>Floyd</b> | so it was once thought, before Noric.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Limech the undead mage stood there, decay-ridden and held at sword
<b>Floyd</b> | point by an imperial guard.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "My lord," hissed the rotting mage. "It is I, Limech." There was a note
<b>Floyd</b> | of anguish in his voice, as if every moment of his lifeless existence
<b>Floyd</b> | was agony. "I bear news from the dark one." Upon his chest, Dunamei saw
<b>Floyd</b> | the clumsy suture of twine and remembered the heart the courier bird
<b>Floyd</b> | had delivered to the council weeks ago. Attached had been a note
<b>Floyd</b> | scrawled in blood indicating the heart had belonged to Limech. Dunamei
<b>Floyd</b> | had little doubt that it had indeed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You are NOT Lord Limech!" shouted the wide-eyed soldier, hysteria
<b>Floyd</b> | cracking his voice. "You are a vile imposter! A profanity!" The long
<b>Floyd</b> | sword quivered in the guard's grip but it remained erect, pointed at
<b>Floyd</b> | the dead mage's torso. "Say the word, Lord Dunamei and I will slay this
<b>Floyd</b> | wicked devil!" Dunamei appraised the soldier for a moment, impressed.
<b>Floyd</b> | He was rightfully terrified, yet this commoner had remained when even
<b>Floyd</b> | mages fled. He thought for a moment, trying to recall the guard's
<b>Floyd</b> | name... Cedreght. Yes, that was it, Cedreght. Dunamei had a new
<b>Floyd</b> | appreciation for this imperial soldier.

<b>Floyd</b> | For a moment, Conrad took notice of an animated corpse far below. It
<b>Floyd</b> | croaked indistinguishable cries of anguish. At first, it seemed to the
<b>Floyd</b> | mage that the undead man might be weeping but no, he was not. Decay had
<b>Floyd</b> | washed over his face some time ago, so how could he have been crying
<b>Floyd</b> | with no eyes?

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It took a moment for him to wrap his mind around the statement. It was
<b>Floyd</b> | uncanny. Conrad had been quick to dismiss the initial jumble of reports
<b>Floyd</b> | that the ancient statue had awakened, but now he had received
<b>Floyd</b> | confirmation. It was unbelievable. He furrowed his brow, trying to
<b>Floyd</b> | calculate any affect upon the plan. His eyes wandered to the
<b>Floyd</b> | proceedings below.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Conrad watched Noric's pale face fixed in a scowl of determination. He
<b>Floyd</b> | had worked tirelessly for weeks, breaking not even for sleep from his
<b>Floyd</b> | necromancy. There was little doubt that Noric had lost his mind; the
<b>Floyd</b> | madness shown unmistakably in his eyes. Each casting seemed to take a
<b>Floyd</b> | toll upon Noric's lucidity, as though each new zombie required a
<b>Floyd</b> | sacrifice of sanity; but what Noric had achieved!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Conrad admired the moving mass of the risen decaying, the mementos of
<b>Floyd</b> | countless wars with Darisia brought forth to do Noric's bidding. It was
<b>Floyd</b> | a massive army that stretched as far as he could see. The power of this
<b>Floyd</b> | military force was immeasurable, the risen soldiers were innumerable.
<b>Floyd</b> | No, he decided at once. It didn't matter that the ancient statue had
<b>Floyd</b> | awoken. Nothing could protect Darisia from this army of rot. Soon the
<b>Floyd</b> | empire would fall and Darisia would see the triumphant return of the
<b>Floyd</b> | exiled mages!
