NightFloyd Transcript:<BR><B><I>Till Death Makes a Monk-Fish Out of Me</I> by Jon Ingold and Mike Sousa</b></FONT><FONT FACE='arial, sans-serif, helvetica' SIZE='1'></BR>As played on ifMUD on September 21, 2011</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2">Like ClubFloyd, the idea behind NightFloyd is that a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</BR></BR>Unlike ClubFloyd, NightFloyd often (but not always) takes on significantly larger works of interactive fiction, knowing going in that each one will take multiple sessions.  NightFloyd is also a bit more informal than ClubFloyd in that it's only announced on the ifMUD #clubfloyd bulletin board, and the time shifts around to meet player's schedules far more than ClubFloyd does.  NightFloyd is organized by genericgeekgirl, aka Adri.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Till Death Makes a Monk-Fish Out of Me</i>, written by Jon Ingold and Mike Sousa.  <I>Till Death Makes a Monk-Fish Out of Me</I> was released as part of the 2002 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took second place.  It was nominated for Xyzzies for Best Game, Best Individual Puzzle,
Best Story, and Best Writing.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Till_Death_Makes_a_Monk-Fish_Out_of_Me'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br>(And in case you're wondering, yes, there are two <I>Till Death Makes a Monk-Fish Out of Me</I> transcripts on this site; ClubFloyd played it in 2009, but NightFloyd chose to revisit it in 2011.)</BR></BR><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | Victoria enters the room, pushing a trolley in front of it, on which

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A loose panel hangs from the doorframe - it seems it's incurred some

<b>Floyd</b> | The ramp which leads back down to the main room is north.

<b>Floyd</b> | There's a screwdriver lying on the floor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A lab coat is crumpled in the corner.  You're shivering, and quickly

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It is the design for a black-box module with a multistrand wire feed
