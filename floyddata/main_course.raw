The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of two Odd Comp Games, <i>Main Course</I> and <I>I am the Law</i>.  <i>Main Course</I> was written by quantumsheep, it took fifth place in the Odd Comp, and you can learn more about it, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Main_Course'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>. <i>I am the Law</I> was written by djchallis, it took second place in the Odd Comp, and you can learn more about it, including how to download it, <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/I_Am_the_Law'><u>here</u></A>.</br></br>

The transcript begins with <I>Main Course</I>.  If you'd like to skip to the transcript for <I>I am the Law</I>, click <A HREF="#law"><U>here</U></A>.</br></br>
<FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | SCARE WARNING
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The game uses Adrift's Battle System, something not fully supported by
<b>Floyd</b> | this release of SCARE.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | SCARE will still run the game, but it will not create character
<b>Floyd</b> | battles where they would normally occur.  For some games, this may be
<b>Floyd</b> | perfectly okay, as the Battle System is sometimes turned on by
<b>Floyd</b> | accident in a game, but never actually used.  For others, though, the
<b>Floyd</b> | omission of this feature may be more serious.

<b>Floyd</b> | On board is a precious cargo, drugged to sleep through the journey.

<b>Floyd</b> | A SoMorph.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In an inebriated state, a SoMorph is the size of a tennis ball, and

<b>Floyd</b> | Two days into the month long journey, the SoMorph is waking up. With a

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Uninebriated, a SoMorph is two foot tall, purple, with tentacles and a
<b>Floyd</b> | single, central eye. It has some mind reading capabilities. It knows
<b>Floyd</b> | things it shouldn't.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Its mouth can morph to eat any creature. It has eaten humans before.
<b>Floyd</b> | Absorbed their language and limited knowledge.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It can sometimes appear to others in the form of its most recent prey.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The SoMorph is waking up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And it wants to go home...

<b>Floyd</b> | this release of SCARE.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | SCARE will still run the game, but it will not create character
<b>Floyd</b> | battles where they would normally occur.  For some games, this may be
<b>Floyd</b> | perfectly okay, as the Battle System is sometimes turned on by
<b>Floyd</b> | accident in a game, but never actually used.  For others, though, the
<b>Floyd</b> | omission of this feature may be more serious.

<b>Floyd</b> | Written by djchallis
<b>Floyd</b> | Beta-tested by Kiravorn, Beanless & Raindrop.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game was written as an entry to an ADRIFT competition called "The
<b>Floyd</b> | Odd Competition". It's rules gave strict limitations to your
<b>Floyd</b> | programming (limited rooms, objects, tasks, events & characters).
<b>Floyd</b> | Therefore this, and the other entries, are rather short and aren't
<b>Floyd</b> | that intricate. This game may feel a little bland or empty, and it
<b>Floyd</b> | lacks much of the polish I'd like to put in.
<b>Floyd</b> | Please do not use this game to judge the standard of my text
<b>Floyd</b> | adventures or stories, but please do enjoy the game.
<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks. :-)

<b>Floyd</b> | The next two screens explain the basics of text adventures for the
<b>Floyd</b> | benefit of those who aren't familiar with them. If you already are,
<b>Floyd</b> | don't forget to read the screen marked "important", because you'll
<b>Floyd</b> | still need to know that.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Text adventures put you, the reader, in control of the lead character.
<b>Floyd</b> | The game will tell you the story, where you are and what you're doing,
<b>Floyd</b> | and will then leave it up to you. Whatever you type, your character
<b>Floyd</b> | will do.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Commands are typically in the form: "verb noun". For example:
<b>Floyd</b> | "Kick the bucket"
<b>Floyd</b> | "Open the door"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | They can get more complicated:
<b>Floyd</b> | "Put the pen on the table"

<b>Floyd</b> | Here are some of the basic commands you'll need to use for this game,
<b>Floyd</b> | although it will likely be required to use other ones as well. I use a
<b>Floyd</b> | pen as an example in the list.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Examine pen" - give you a closer look at the pen for clues.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Move north" - walks north. The directions you'll need to walk in are
<b>Floyd</b> | N, S, W & E.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Inventory" - tells you what items you're carrying.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Look" - tells you about your surroundings.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Take pen" - picks up the pen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Most of these commands have alternatives that also work, and also
<b>Floyd</b> | short-hand versions to save time.
<b>Floyd</b> | l = look
<b>Floyd</b> | x = examine
<b>Floyd</b> | i = inventory
<b>Floyd</b> | n = north
<b>Floyd</b> | etc.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Text adventures generally require clever thought to proceed. Read
<b>Floyd</b> | everything carefully and try anything you think of.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | IMPORTANT!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In this game knowledge is everything. You are trying to solve a
<b>Floyd</b> | murder. The way to do this is to ask characters about thigs. Please
<b>Floyd</b> | use the default ADRIFT phrasing for this:
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ask Bob about Jim"
<b>Floyd</b> | (please always include the name of the character you're talking to.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can ask characters about other characters, or about objects, or
<b>Floyd</b> | events, or places, or anything. Chances are if it's been mentioned
<b>Floyd</b> | somewhere, they'll have something to say about it. If you ask them
<b>Floyd</b> | about the right things, you'll get some useful knowledge. Always ask
<b>Floyd</b> | characters about single-word subjects, or short phrases or names.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On some occasions, new pieces of information will be written in blue
<b>Floyd</b> | text. When this happens, you can ask characters about what was in
<b>Floyd</b> | blue, regardless of how many words it was. For example:
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ask Bob about blue text"
<b>Floyd</b> | This will happen for subjects you might miss or might not guess the
<b>Floyd</b> | phrasing for. But not all new subjects will be in blue. If you think a
<b>Floyd</b> | character said something important, ask them about it anyway.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When you think you know who the murderer was, type:
<b>Floyd</b> | "make verdict"
<b>Floyd</b> | The game will then ask for your thoughts. If you're right, you'll win;
<b>Floyd</b> | if not, you won't.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lastly, please click on the options tab at the top of your window.
<b>Floyd</b> | Make sure "verbose" is ticked. Also, click on "Display & Media..."
<b>Floyd</b> | button and make sure the box marked: "Room names in descriptions" is
<b>Floyd</b> | ticked.
<b>Floyd</b> | Thank you.

<b>Floyd</b> | I stand up from my chair as I feel my one-man ship docking with the
<b>Floyd</b> | space station. Sure enough, the door to my ship opens in front of me a
<b>Floyd</b> | second later. I take out my electronic notepad, ready to make notes.
<b>Floyd</b> | There's a man waiting for me a few paces away, so I walk out to greet
<b>Floyd</b> | him.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Good morning, I'm detective Joshua Kent," I say, holding out my hand.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Good morning detective," the man replies formally, shaking my hand,
<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm Luke, the second-in-command, and now the highest ranking person
<b>Floyd</b> | on this space station."
<b>Floyd</b> | "Would that mean that your Captain was...?" I ask.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Captain Seth was murdered last night, yes," Luke says. "I made the
<b>Floyd</b> | call as soon as I discovered the body."
<b>Floyd</b> | "Very good." This man knows procedure it seems. This will make my life
<b>Floyd</b> | a little easier. "I was told this is a research space station?"
<b>Floyd</b> | "That's right." Luke nods. "We're all scientists here in this tiny
<b>Floyd</b> | machine. Our mission statement is 'to record the effects of lower
<b>Floyd</b> | life-forms under a system collapse'. We all live here and do our
<b>Floyd</b> | research as a quiet, secluded team. That's why I was surprised that
<b>Floyd</b> | one of my own would do such a thing."
<b>Floyd</b> | "Thanks for the information. Where are the suspects?"
<b>Floyd</b> | "Lined up in the entrace lobby, just through here," Luke says, and
<b>Floyd</b> | begins to walk towards a door. I stop him quickly.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Luke?" He turns around. "You realise that you are a suspect as well?"
<b>Floyd</b> | "Of course. But I believe in your profession, Joshua. I believe you'll
<b>Floyd</b> | find the real killer, and so I've put aside my own emotions briefly in
<b>Floyd</b> | order to assist you. The sooner you discover the truth, the sooner we
<b>Floyd</b> | can clean up this mess. Do you disagree?"

<b>Floyd</b> | The entrace lobby is a small, bare room that seems to branch off to
<b>Floyd</b> | the rest of the space station. True to Luke's word, there were some
<b>Floyd</b> | people lined up, waiting for us with varying levels of tidiness. Luke
<b>Floyd</b> | brings me over to them and begins to introduce them.
<b>Floyd</b> | "This is Calvin, our chief computing expert," Luke says.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Pleased to meet you, Calvin." I hold out my hand again, watching him
<b>Floyd</b> | closely. He's smartly dressed and looks at me through his glasses with
<b>Floyd</b> | keen eyes. He shakes my hand.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Pleased to meet you too," Calvin says. "I trust you'll do your
<b>Floyd</b> | profession proud and clear this up quickly?"
<b>Floyd</b> | "I'll do my best," I say, moving on to the next person.
<b>Floyd</b> | The next person is a slightly larger, slightly shorter and slightly
<b>Floyd</b> | sloppier man. He holds out his hand ready for me.
<b>Floyd</b> | "William, sir," he says.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Pleased to meet you, William."
<b>Floyd</b> | He seems a little nervous, so I don't press in. The third and final
<b>Floyd</b> | person in the line is younger than the others, but just as smart as
<b>Floyd</b> | Calvin.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Tim is fresh out of university, he's quite the scientist already,"
<b>Floyd</b> | Luke says.
<b>Floyd</b> | "You're a detective, right?" Tim asks, losing the formality I'd
<b>Floyd</b> | assumed from his dress sense.
<b>Floyd</b> | "I am," I say, shaking his hand.
<b>Floyd</b> | "I've always wanted to meet a detective," he says, smiling  broadly.
<b>Floyd</b> | "I just want to let you know that if you need anything at all in your
<b>Floyd</b> | quest, I'm here to help."

<b>Floyd</b> | back away from the line and draw myself up as I talk to them.
<b>Floyd</b> | "I assume you all know basic detective law, but for the benefit of
<b>Floyd</b> | those who don't, I'll explain it now. The simplest way of thinking
<b>Floyd</b> | about it is that I am the law. When I find the killer it is my word,
<b>Floyd</b> | although reviewed by three peers first, that will decide their fate.
<b>Floyd</b> | My word is the law, and I am free to add anything I wish to your

<b>Floyd</b> | "Nothing," he says. He's clearly lying. I take a step towards the
<b>Floyd</b> | curtain and suddenly he's sitting up-right and staring right at me. I
<b>Floyd</b> | make a mental note that Tim said something useful after all.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Why do you want to see behind there?" he asks.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Because," I say in my best commanding-detective voice, "I have reason
<b>Floyd</b> | to believe that you are hiding something. You are so worried of what's
<b>Floyd</b> | going to happen to you, but I can assure you, I will keep you safe. It
<b>Floyd</b> | is my job to bring justice, and not to let chaos rule. Trust me."
<b>Floyd</b> | There's a long pause, and I can see the cogs in William's head
<b>Floyd</b> | ticking. I give him his time. He needs to decide he can trust me on
<b>Floyd</b> | his own. Eventually William opens his mouth.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ok, I'll trust you," he says. "If you promise I'll be safe through
<b>Floyd</b> | and after all of this."
<b>Floyd</b> | "I promise," I say with a smile. William takes a deep breath and then
<b>Floyd</b> | starts to talk.
<b>Floyd</b> | "I've been a high-class scientist all my life," he says, "but I seem
<b>Floyd</b> | to have had the worst luck. I keep taking jobs that collapse around

<b>Floyd</b> | or betrayed. You name it, it's happened to me. I've lost so much
<b>Floyd</b> | money, and have had to restart my career so many times. But it's not
<b>Floyd</b> | an issue of pride and money anymore. I have a family I need to
<b>Floyd</b> | support. I took this job because the pay was so high. I didn't like

<b>Floyd</b> | William grabs the curtain and pulls. As it falls to the floor, I see a
<b>Floyd</b> | hole in the wall the size of a wardrobe, full of notebooks.
<b>Floyd</b> | "In these notebooks," William informs me, "is a record of what

<b>Floyd</b> | "You kept tabs on all four of them?" I ask.
<b>Floyd</b> | "That's right," William says. "Luke, Tim, Calvin and even Seth."
<b>Floyd</b> | "What did you find out?" I ask, eagerly.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Nothing," he says with a sigh. "But despite the evidence telling me I

<b>Floyd</b> | "First," William says with a triumphant smile, "you're going to want
<b>Floyd</b> | to see this."
<b>Floyd</b> | He holds out a notebook. The date says November 5th. The day of the
<b>Floyd</b> | murder. I read through it quickly, and then look up at William, who
<b>Floyd</b> | nods.
<b>Floyd</b> | "That's right," he says. "Nobody entered V's room on the day of the

<b>Floyd</b> | "But she said someone issued her orders to do with the doors and

<b>Floyd</b> | This game was written as an entry to an ADRIFT competition called "The
<b>Floyd</b> | Odd Competition". It's rules gave strict limitations to your
<b>Floyd</b> | programming (limited rooms, objects, tasks, events & characters).
<b>Floyd</b> | Therefore this, and the other entries, are rather short and aren't
<b>Floyd</b> | that intricate. This game may feel a little bland or empty, and it
<b>Floyd</b> | lacks much of the polish I'd like to put in.
<b>Floyd</b> | Please do not use this game to judge the standard of my text
<b>Floyd</b> | adventures or stories, but please do enjoy the game.
<b>Floyd</b> | Thanks. :-)

<b>Floyd</b> | don't forget to read the screen marked "important", because you'll
<b>Floyd</b> | still need to know that.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Text adventures put you, the reader, in control of the lead character.
<b>Floyd</b> | The game will tell you the story, where you are and what you're doing,
<b>Floyd</b> | and will then leave it up to you. Whatever you type, your character
<b>Floyd</b> | will do.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Commands are typically in the form: "verb noun". For example:
<b>Floyd</b> | "Kick the bucket"
<b>Floyd</b> | "Open the door"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | They can get more complicated:
<b>Floyd</b> | "Put the pen on the table"

<b>Floyd</b> | Here are some of the basic commands you'll need to use for this game,
<b>Floyd</b> | although it will likely be required to use other ones as well. I use a
<b>Floyd</b> | pen as an example in the list.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Examine pen" - give you a closer look at the pen for clues.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Move north" - walks north. The directions you'll need to walk in are
<b>Floyd</b> | N, S, W & E.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Inventory" - tells you what items you're carrying.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Look" - tells you about your surroundings.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Take pen" - picks up the pen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Most of these commands have alternatives that also work, and also
<b>Floyd</b> | short-hand versions to save time.
<b>Floyd</b> | l = look
<b>Floyd</b> | x = examine
<b>Floyd</b> | i = inventory
<b>Floyd</b> | n = north
<b>Floyd</b> | etc.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Text adventures generally require clever thought to proceed. Read
<b>Floyd</b> | everything carefully and try anything you think of.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | IMPORTANT!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In this game knowledge is everything. You are trying to solve a
<b>Floyd</b> | murder. The way to do this is to ask characters about thigs. Please
<b>Floyd</b> | use the default ADRIFT phrasing for this:
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ask Bob about Jim"
<b>Floyd</b> | (please always include the name of the character you're talking to.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can ask characters about other characters, or about objects, or
<b>Floyd</b> | events, or places, or anything. Chances are if it's been mentioned
<b>Floyd</b> | somewhere, they'll have something to say about it. If you ask them
<b>Floyd</b> | about the right things, you'll get some useful knowledge. Always ask
<b>Floyd</b> | characters about single-word subjects, or short phrases or names.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On some occasions, new pieces of information will be written in blue
<b>Floyd</b> | text. When this happens, you can ask characters about what was in
<b>Floyd</b> | blue, regardless of how many words it was. For example:
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ask Bob about blue text"
<b>Floyd</b> | This will happen for subjects you might miss or might not guess the
<b>Floyd</b> | phrasing for. But not all new subjects will be in blue. If you think a
<b>Floyd</b> | character said something important, ask them about it anyway.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When you think you know who the murderer was, type:
<b>Floyd</b> | "make verdict"
<b>Floyd</b> | The game will then ask for your thoughts. If you're right, you'll win;
<b>Floyd</b> | if not, you won't.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Lastly, please click on the options tab at the top of your window.
<b>Floyd</b> | Make sure "verbose" is ticked. Also, click on "Display & Media..."
<b>Floyd</b> | button and make sure the box marked: "Room names in descriptions" is
<b>Floyd</b> | ticked.
<b>Floyd</b> | Thank you.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I stand up from my chair as I feel my one-man ship docking with the
<b>Floyd</b> | space station. Sure enough, the door to my ship opens in front of me a
<b>Floyd</b> | second later. I take out my electronic notepad, ready to make notes.
<b>Floyd</b> | There's a man waiting for me a few paces away, so I walk out to greet
<b>Floyd</b> | him.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Good morning, I'm detective Joshua Kent," I say, holding out my hand.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Good morning detective," the man replies formally, shaking my hand,
<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm Luke, the second-in-command, and now the highest ranking person
<b>Floyd</b> | on this space station."
<b>Floyd</b> | "Would that mean that your Captain was...?" I ask.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Captain Seth was murdered last night, yes," Luke says. "I made the
<b>Floyd</b> | call as soon as I discovered the body."
<b>Floyd</b> | "Very good." This man knows procedure it seems. This will make my life
<b>Floyd</b> | a little easier. "I was told this is a research space station?"
<b>Floyd</b> | "That's right." Luke nods. "We're all scientists here in this tiny
<b>Floyd</b> | machine. Our mission statement is 'to record the effects of lower
<b>Floyd</b> | life-forms under a system collapse'. We all live here and do our
<b>Floyd</b> | research as a quiet, secluded team. That's why I was surprised that
<b>Floyd</b> | one of my own would do such a thing."
<b>Floyd</b> | "Thanks for the information. Where are the suspects?"
<b>Floyd</b> | "Lined up in the entrace lobby, just through here," Luke says, and
<b>Floyd</b> | begins to walk towards a door. I stop him quickly.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Luke?" He turns around. "You realise that you are a suspect as well?"
<b>Floyd</b> | "Of course. But I believe in your profession, Joshua. I believe you'll
<b>Floyd</b> | find the real killer, and so I've put aside my own emotions briefly in
<b>Floyd</b> | order to assist you. The sooner you discover the truth, the sooner we
<b>Floyd</b> | can clean up this mess. Do you disagree?"
<b>Floyd</b> | I shake my head, and we continue through to the entrance lobby.

<b>Floyd</b> | The entrace lobby is a small, bare room that seems to branch off to

<b>Floyd</b> | "I'll do my best," I say, moving on to the next person.

<b>Floyd</b> | He seems a little nervous, so I don't press in. The third and final

<b>Floyd</b> | "Tim is fresh out of university, he's quite the scientist already,"

<b>Floyd</b> | I turn to Luke. "Is that everyone?"
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yes," he says.
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm surprised. Only four of them? Five before the Captain died I
<b>Floyd</b> | guess. Still, one of these is the killer? I guess so. I take a step
<b>Floyd</b> | back away from the line and draw myself up as I talk to them.
<b>Floyd</b> | "I assume you all know basic detective law, but for the benefit of
<b>Floyd</b> | those who don't, I'll explain it now. The simplest way of thinking
<b>Floyd</b> | about it is that I am the law. When I find the killer it is my word,
<b>Floyd</b> | although reviewed by three peers first, that will decide their fate.
<b>Floyd</b> | My word is the law, and I am free to add anything I wish to your
<b>Floyd</b> | permanent records. If my judgement of the killer is approved, so will
<b>Floyd</b> | my judgement in all other matters regarding you and your space
<b>Floyd</b> | station. I say this not to scare you but to help both you and I. You
<b>Floyd</b> | can be assured that the greatest power in this empire is working on
<b>Floyd</b> | your crisis, and if you help me then I can be assured that this will
<b>Floyd</b> | be over quickly. Thank you for your time."
<b>Floyd</b> | The line seems to dismiss itself, with each of them walking off in
<b>Floyd</b> | different directions. Tim gives me another look before he leaves. Luke
<b>Floyd</b> | walks up to me.
<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm sorry to leave you so soon, but I'd quite like to take a break
<b>Floyd</b> | after last night's events. I'll be in the lounge if you need me," he
<b>Floyd</b> | says. "Calvin will probably be working still at the workstations.
<b>Floyd</b> | William said he'd be in his room but he said he won't mind you coming
<b>Floyd</b> | in to talk to him. Tim will be hanging around, probably in one of the
<b>Floyd</b> | corridors. He's been eager to meet you. If you want to check something
<b>Floyd</b> | with the computer, feel free. We don't have a network of terminals,
<b>Floyd</b> | it's just the one machine to look after the ship. It's in it's own
