The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Ad Verbum</i>, written by Nick&nbsp;Montfort.  <i>Ad Verbum</i> was originally released as part of the 2000 IF Competition, where it took fourth place. It went on to garner Xyzzy nominations for Best Individual Puzzle, Best Use of Medium, and Best Puzzles, ultimately taking the Xyzzy for Best Puzzles.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Ad_Verbum"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

</br>After we were finished playing <I>Ad Verbum</I>, we did a quick playthrough of another wordplay game, <i>Things</i>, a speed IF written by Jacqueline&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Lott and Sam&nbsp;Kabo&nbsp;Ashwell.  <i>Things</i> was part of Speed-IF >= 20, and was mostly notable for using as few nouns as possible.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Things"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.

So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | Foyer
<b>Floyd</b> | This is the mansion's spacious ground-floor antechamber. The wallpaper
<b>Floyd</b> | is peeling and bits of plaster have fallen from the ceiling here and

<b>Floyd</b> | there. There is a stairway, stable enough to ascend. The big area to
<b>Floyd</b> | the west must have once been a separate room, but the demolition crew
<b>Floyd</b> | seems to have already taken out a wall. A living room is east. On the
<b>Floyd</b> | south side is the front door. A Dumpster has been dumped here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The contractor clears his throat and points at the big Dumpster.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Forget the fixtures, but pick up everything that's not bolted down,
<b>Floyd</b> | including the stuff out back. Then, drop off all the debris - er, I
<b>Floyd</b> | mean, um, treasures - right here ..." He scrawls something on the
<b>Floyd</b> | Dumpster with a marker. "Good luck!" The contractor hurries out the
<b>Floyd</b> | front door, which slams closed, leaving you alone.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You spot a door to the north, leading out back. It is shut quite
<b>Floyd</b> | tight.

<b>Floyd</b> | entirely without recourse to a certain frequently-used letter. The

<b>Floyd</b> | jacket is folded, it seems like "A Void" - wherever that absent book
<b>Floyd</b> | may be - is a sizable volume.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | From the looks of the dust casing, these used to be a large bug

<b>Floyd</b> | Antepenultimate Lobby

<b>Floyd</b> | This lobby, allowing access to the rooms of the next-to-next-to-top
<b>Floyd</b> | floor, is in good shape. It is very similar to the lobby below,
<b>Floyd</b> | although the ceiling may be a bit lower. Here there are only three
<b>Floyd</b> | passages. Two of them (to the n and e) are normal passages, but one,
<b>Floyd</b> | to the s, is oddly constrained. It has an ominous sign above it. The
<b>Floyd</b> | main stairway leads d, while another staircase, straight and narrow,

<b>Floyd</b> | allows passage u to the next floor.

<b>Floyd</b> | Initial Lobby
<b>Floyd</b> | The lobby of the mansion's initial floor - the one above the ground
<b>Floyd</b> | floor - is an ordinary and fairly well-maintained room. There are some
<b>Floyd</b> | things scrawled on the ground here, in the contractor's handwriting:
<b>Floyd</b> | '1 object' is written to the n, while toward the other three exits on
<b>Floyd</b> | this floor '2' is scrawled. The stairway that runs d to the foyer

<b>Floyd</b> | turns and continues u, to the next floor. The constrained passages to
<b>Floyd</b> | the s, e, w, and n look as if they might spell trouble. Or perhaps
<b>Floyd</b> | they simply spell 'SEWN.'
