<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You're just starting to doze off when a jerking motion brings you back
<b>Floyd</b> | to alertness.  You look over to see your boss, Mr. Teeterwaller,
<b>Floyd</b> | struggling to steer the car onto the shoulder as the engine dies.  You
<b>Floyd</b> | can see that all of the dashboard lights are on as the car jerks to a
<b>Floyd</b> | stop.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This is turning into a fine business trip.  First Mr. Teeterwaller
<b>Floyd</b> | insists on making the five-hour car trip in the middle of the night so
<b>Floyd</b> | the company won't have to pay for a hotel, then you spend an hour stuck
<b>Floyd</b> | behind a convoy of slow trucks on Teeterwaller's two-lane supposed
<b>Floyd</b> | short-cut, and now his aging bargain-basement car strands you out in
<b>Floyd</b> | the middle of nowhere.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Teeterwaller turns off the headlights and turns on the hazard lights.
<b>Floyd</b> | "I just had this thing in the shop," he mumbles.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Plant
<b>Floyd</b> | TADS Interactive Fiction by Michael J. Roberts

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the car
<b>Floyd</b> |    The Toyunchknisk Piglet was imported from Blottnya during the brief
<b>Floyd</b> | period between the fall of the old iron-fisted regime and the ethnic
<b>Floyd</b> | unrest that divided the tiny country into several even tinier countries
<b>Floyd</b> | whose names you can't recall, since the press lost interest several
<b>Floyd</b> | years ago.  The car is almost comically spartan, so it's just like your
<b>Floyd</b> | boss to own one.  The only amenity the dashboard offers is a glove
<b>Floyd</b> | compartment; no radio, no air conditioner, no console armrest, no
<b>Floyd</b> | cup-holders.
<b>Floyd</b> |    You're sitting in the rather uncomfortable passenger's seat.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | driver's door is closed, and your door is closed.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Sitting on the back seat is a jacket, a map, a Project Tyche manual,
<b>Floyd</b> | and a magazine.  The ignition seems to contain a car key.
<b>Floyd</b> |    Your boss Mr. Teeterwaller is here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You're carrying your temporary ID card.

<b>Floyd</b> |    Rows of drab gray metal desks extend off in all directions,
<b>Floyd</b> | separated by just enough space to form aisles.  On each desk is a

<b>Floyd</b> | of some kind.  Some of the piles of paper are narrow, precariously
<b>Floyd</b> | balanced columns, others are mounds; a few have fallen over, scattering
<b>Floyd</b> | papers across the floor.
<b>Floyd</b> |    A large door (currently open) to the south leads out of the
<b>Floyd</b> | building.  The area near the door, where you're standing, is clear of
<b>Floyd</b> | desks, and instead is mostly open, except for a huge workbench.
<b>Floyd</b> | Several huge burlap sacks full of envelopes are piled alongside the

<b>Floyd</b> |    Sitting on the workbench is a small plastic device and a looseleaf

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Narrow passage
<b>Floyd</b> |    The pipes are just barely far enough apart here for you to squeeze
<b>Floyd</b> | through to the northwest, but this is otherwise a dead end.
<b>Floyd</b> |    A space between some pipes to the east affords a peephole view of a
<b>Floyd</b> | large courtyard.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Look!"  Mr. Teeterwaller says, pointing through the opening in the
<b>Floyd</b> | pipes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Through the opening, you can see several trucks parked in the
<b>Floyd</b> | courtyard--the same trucks that you saw hijacked.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Two people, wearing baggy white whole-body suits with hoods and gas
<b>Floyd</b> | masks, emerge from the back of one of the trucks, walking backwards,
<b>Floyd</b> | carrying something.  They continue out down a ramp at the back of the
<b>Floyd</b> | truck; two more people dressed the same way come into view, also
<b>Floyd</b> | helping to carry the object, which you can now see is a large shiny
<b>Floyd</b> | silver crate.  Two more people come out of the truck, then another two
<b>Floyd</b> | carrying the trailing end of the crate.  The eight slowly make their
<b>Floyd</b> | way down the ramp with the obviously heavy cargo.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You wonder what they could be removing from the trucks that requires
<b>Floyd</b> | such elaborate protective clothing.  You look at Teeterwaller.  He's
<b>Floyd</b> | watching intently, but, strangely, does not seem surprised by what he's
<b>Floyd</b> | seeing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Another space-suited worker emerges from the truck, slowly waving a
<b>Floyd</b> | wand attached by a cord to a box that makes intermittent ticking
<b>Floyd</b> | sounds.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You feel a chill as you realize that the cargo must be radioactive.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The group and their load disappear behind the truck, and the clicking
<b>Floyd</b> | of the Geiger counter recedes into inaudibility.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Teeterwaller continues watching for a few moments.  "Interesting," he

<b>Floyd</b> |    A metal cage, suspended a few inches off the ground by a cable
<b>Floyd</b> | hanging from a beam overhead, is just this side of the glass.
<b>Floyd</b> |    About fifty feet to the east, you can see the nozzle of the fire

<b>Floyd</b> | on the hose."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Slowly, you maneuver yourself over to the edge nearest the opening, and

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You realize you've been holding your breath, and force yourself to

<b>Floyd</b> | but finally getting a good grip on it.  You carefully swing one leg out
<b>Floyd</b> | onto the framework supporting the windows, then the other, taking care
<b>Floyd</b> | not to put any weight on the glass.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With nothing left to do, you let go of the cage with your other hand
<b>Floyd</b> | and grab at the hose.  The framework is obviously sturdy enough to
<b>Floyd</b> | support you if it can support all of this glass, you keep telling
<b>Floyd</b> | yourself, but you can feel it flexing under you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Having successfully negotiated the chasm between the cage and the hose,
<b>Floyd</b> | you feel much less panicked, and start descending the hose.  It's a
<b>Floyd</b> | nice rough material and easy to grip as you climb down.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The descent takes less time than you would have thought, given the
<b>Floyd</b> | amount of hose you had to feed down through the hatch.  You reach the

<b>Floyd</b> | Darkness suddenly falls over the room as all of the lights go out; a
<b>Floyd</b> | second later, the electrodes blaze with a blinding flash of white light
<b>Floyd</b> | and make a loud pop like a balloon bursting.  The spark fades, and the
<b>Floyd</b> | disk glows with an intense but ghostly blue light.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You suddenly feel like you're tumbling sideways, and it feels like
<b>Floyd</b> | something is pulling your feet and your head in opposite directions.
<b>Floyd</b> | You reach out for something to hold, but find nothing in reach.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Just as you think you're going to hit the ground, you realize that the
<b>Floyd</b> | floor is twenty feet away and getting further.  You're falling, but
<b>Floyd</b> | somehow you're falling toward the ceiling.  The room is spinning
<b>Floyd</b> | rapidly, and you see that Mr. Teeterwaller is falling alongside you,
<b>Floyd</b> | his eyes closed and his arms flailing wildly; beside him the
<b>Floyd</b> | brightly-glowing disk is serenly floating in mid-air.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You keep falling upwards for several seconds, moving directly toward a
<b>Floyd</b> | large air vent on the ceiling.  You draw closer and closer to the vent,
<b>Floyd</b> | and you brace yourself for impact.  In a moment the vent is only a few
<b>Floyd</b> | feet away, but now you can see that you're not moving very quickly
<b>Floyd</b> | after all, and you easily maneuver yourself into the opening.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Teeterwaller crashes into the ceiling just outside the vent, but you
<b>Floyd</b> | manage to grab his arm and help him through the opening.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You find yourself in a large air duct.  The disk floats up through the
<b>Floyd</b> | opening; its glow gradually fades, and as it does, you, Teeterwaller,
<b>Floyd</b> | and the disk settle to the floor of the duct.  Gravity returns to
<b>Floyd</b> | normal.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Air duct
<b>Floyd</b> |    This aluminum air duct is just large enough to crawl through here,
<b>Floyd</b> | but splits into several smaller ducts to the west, none of which are
<b>Floyd</b> | large enough to permit further passage.  The duct widens to the east.
<b>Floyd</b> | In the floor is a square opening, two feet on a side, whose cover has
<b>Floyd</b> | been swung out and down; a cavernous chamber below is visible through
<b>Floyd</b> | the opening.
<b>Floyd</b> |    You see a black disk here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Through the opening, you see the door to the lab slide open, and dozens
<b>Floyd</b> | of guards rush into the lab, looking up at you from the floor far

<b>Floyd</b> | anti-gravity disks, but the police just ignore you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After a night in the local jail, the police release you, explaining
<b>Floyd</b> | that the company that owns the plant is not pressing charges.  In town,
<b>Floyd</b> | you and Teeterwaller find a mechanic to fix the car.  You return home,
<b>Floyd</b> | having missed your meeting.  Life returns to normal.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the months that follow, the subject of that strange night seems to
<b>Floyd</b> | become taboo, and you and Teeterwaller never again discuss it.
<b>Floyd</b> | Eventually, Teeterwaller leaves the company; you hear later that he's
<b>Floyd</b> | working for one of those UFO magazines, writing bitter diatribes about
<b>Floyd</b> | government conspiracies and military cover-ups.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You often wonder what might have happened if you had escaped with the
<b>Floyd</b> | odd little black disk, but you feel fortunate enough to have made it
<b>Floyd</b> | through the experience unscathed.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | *** Your life has returned to normal. ***
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your score is 85 of a possible 100, in 748 moves.  If Mr. Teeterwaller
<b>Floyd</b> | were to evaluate your performance thus far, he would rank you as the

<b>Floyd</b> | Author's Notes
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Are we in Blottnya yet?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Some people who played the Competition Edition wondered whether the
<b>Floyd</b> | game was meant to take place in Blottnya.  There's so much Blottnian
<b>Floyd</b> | stuff lying around (Teeterwaller's car, the dog, the article in the
<b>Floyd</b> | Dufon journal, the language textbook), especially in the areas outside
<b>Floyd</b> | the plant complex, that it may seem that the setting is Blottnya.  If
<b>Floyd</b> | you made this assumption, you probably found it jarring near the end of
<b>Floyd</b> | the game when the gray-haired man says a few things that strongly imply
<b>Floyd</b> | that the setting is really the United States (he mentions Arizona and
<b>Floyd</b> | Illinois, for example).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | All of the Blottnian references were really just a motif, and weren't
<b>Floyd</b> | meant to imply that the story was set in Blottnya.  In fact, to me the
<b>Floyd</b> | language textbook suggests that we're not in Blottnya, since it teaches
<b>Floyd</b> | Blottnian as a foreign language to speakers of English.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In this revised edition, I've tried to make it more obvious from the
<b>Floyd</b> | start that we're not in Blottnya.  For example, if you ask Teeterwaller
<b>Floyd</b> | about Blottnya, he'll tell you that he traveled there years ago and
<b>Floyd</b> | doesn't want to go back; Teeterwaller also points out while you're
<b>Floyd</b> | reading the textbook that he's never heard of anyone "in this country"
<b>Floyd</b> | studying Blottnian.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What happened to the hostages?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The fate of the guards from the hijacked trucks is a detail that never
<b>Floyd</b> | made it into the final game, mostly for lack of time before the
<b>Floyd</b> | competition.  My plan was to include a seminar room where the guards
<b>Floyd</b> | from the trucks were watching a presentation on the many reasons to
<b>Floyd</b> | switch employers and join the company that owns the plant--great health
<b>Floyd</b> | insurance benefits, a generous relocation allowance, career advancement
<b>Floyd</b> | potential, and a very competitive compensation package.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I always wonder, when I'm watching something like a Bond movie, how
<b>Floyd</b> | these vast criminal enterprises always manage to attract and retain
<b>Floyd</b> | such a large army of generic henchmen, especially when the evil genius
<b>Floyd</b> | running the show is always giving negative performance feedback to
<b>Floyd</b> | underperforming lieutenants by opening the trap door or feeding them to
<b>Floyd</b> | the sharks.  I mean, where's the incentive to come into work in the
<b>Floyd</b> | morning?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | So, the seminar room was supposed to show that the plant's owners were
<b>Floyd</b> | a new kind of criminal enterprise, an enlightened, 90's kind of
<b>Floyd</b> | conspiracy that recognizes that its employees are its most important
<b>Floyd</b> | asset and emphasizes teamwork and coaching over sharks and trap doors.
<b>Floyd</b> | But, it wasn't integral to the story, so in the end it fell off the
<b>Floyd</b> | list.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Would the decoy trucks really work?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Originally, the decoy trucks were never meant to reach their
<b>Floyd</b> | destination.  In my early plans for the game, soon after entering the
<b>Floyd</b> | plant, you'd come across a television (in a guard house) showing
<b>Floyd</b> | coverage of the aftermath of a horrible train wreck that, of course,
<b>Floyd</b> | involved the decoy truck convoy.  The idea was that the trucks would be
<b>Floyd</b> | destroyed in a huge flaming wreck, which would damage everything so
<b>Floyd</b> | badly that the government would never know that the materials had been
<b>Floyd</b> | stolen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As with the recruiting seminar, this detail didn't seem important
<b>Floyd</b> | enough to build a whole scene around it, so the matter of the decoys
<b>Floyd</b> | was handled in the gray-haired man's speech, when he says that the
<b>Floyd</b> | government scientists wouldn't be smart enough to detect the deception.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This doesn't address the question of whether the original guards would
<b>Floyd</b> | be missed (which wasn't as issue with the train wreck, since everyone
<b>Floyd</b> | would have been presumed killed).  However, one can imagine that the
<b>Floyd</b> | people on the receiving end of the shipment didn't know the guards or
<b>Floyd</b> | the drivers personally, so henchmen posing as the guards should have
<b>Floyd</b> | fooled the recipients.  Given the apparent resources of the
<b>Floyd</b> | conspirators, a little bureaucratic tampering should be sufficient to
<b>Floyd</b> | paper over any remaining questions about where all of the guards went
<b>Floyd</b> | after delivering the goods.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | What did Teeterwaller know and when did he know it?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A few people have asked whether Teeterwaller knew what he was getting
<b>Floyd</b> | you into; it has even been suggested that Teeterwaller planned the
<b>Floyd</b> | automobile breakdown so that he'd be at the right place at the right
<b>Floyd</b> | time.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It's clear toward the end of the story that Teeterwaller knows more
<b>Floyd</b> | than he's letting on.  The first real sign of this, I think, is his
<b>Floyd</b> | lack of surprise when you realize that the truck cargo is radioactive,
<b>Floyd</b> | but he's especially blatant in the records room ("I've been looking for
<b>Floyd</b> | this type of information for years").
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Personally, my theory is that Teeterwaller was just incredibly lucky,
<b>Floyd</b> | and that chance favored his prepared mind, which was obviously full of
<b>Floyd</b> | conspiracy theories and UFO trivia to start with.  However, he is
<b>Floyd</b> | suspiciously eager to find out what's going on, and his talk of a "big
<b>Floyd</b> | reward is pretty unconvincing motivation.  (So unconvincing, in fact,
<b>Floyd</b> | that I've changed that detail in this revised edition.  He's now
<b>Floyd</b> | straightforward about being driven by curiousity, and doesn't try the
<b>Floyd</b> | `reward' ploy, but instead simply asks for your help.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A Witness to History
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | One of the techniques that I used throughout this game was multi-turn
<b>Floyd</b> | cut scenes.  In some games, major plot events are related in single,
<b>Floyd</b> | large blocks of text, often called `cut scenes' (a term borrowed from
<b>Floyd</b> | graphical games, which use it to refer to non-interactive sequences of
<b>Floyd</b> | animation, essentially little movies, that fill in plot and provide
<b>Floyd</b> | transitions between game sections).  The Plant uses a similar
<b>Floyd</b> | technique, but I broke up most of these into series of scenes spread
<b>Floyd</b> | out over several turns.  In most cases, you're viewing the events from
<b>Floyd</b> | a distance, and can't do much except watch and wait.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As the author it's always hard to perceive the exact effect that
<b>Floyd</b> | players will, but I have mixed feelings about the technique.  On the
<b>Floyd</b> | one hand, I like the small, easily-digested chunks of text; long
<b>Floyd</b> | monolithic cut scenes are often overwhelming simply in the amount of
<b>Floyd</b> | text that appears all at once.  I also like the way that the multi-turn
<b>Floyd</b> | sequences integrate the cut scenes with `game time,' keeping the action
<b>Floyd</b> | on a somewhat consistent time scale rather than abruptly having many
<b>Floyd</b> | turns' worth of time elapse between two consecutive command prompts.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the other hand, the effect is distancing, in that it removes
<b>Floyd</b> | interactivity from a scene almost as much as a single large cut scene
<b>Floyd</b> | would.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I think that, in future games, I'd like to try to find more interactive
<b>Floyd</b> | ways of unfolding major plot advances.  It's a difficult balancing act,
<b>Floyd</b> | because you want the plot to unfold without puzzling the player, indeed
<b>Floyd</b> | almost in spite of the player--in other words, you essentially want to
<b>Floyd</b> | coerce the player into doing the right thing; but at the same time, you
<b>Floyd</b> | want the player to feel a degree of freedom of action greater than I
<b>Floyd</b> | offered in these cut scenes.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Some games achieve this type of coercion by killing the player on a
<b>Floyd</b> | misstep, but I think this destroys the illusion of interactivity by
<b>Floyd</b> | forcing you to save and restore repeatedly, since you're essentially
<b>Floyd</b> | trying to navigate through a minefield.  I think a better approach
<b>Floyd</b> | would be to make it so obvious what to do next, and so rewarding to do
<b>Floyd</b> | the obvious thing, that the player will naturally feel inclined play
<b>Floyd</b> | along and follow your script--ideally without even realizing that
<b>Floyd</b> | there's a script.  The multi-turn cut scenes in this game are a very
<b>Floyd</b> | primitive attempt at this, I think, but since the only thing you can do
<b>Floyd</b> | is `wait,' it gets repetitive after a while.  Something to keep in mind
<b>Floyd</b> | on the next game.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (One of the biggest changes that I made after starting work on the game
<b>Floyd</b> | was adding Mr. Teeterwaller.  Originally, the player was going to be
<b>Floyd</b> | alone.  I decided very early on that I wanted the player to have a
<b>Floyd</b> | companion who had an inkling (or at least a suspicion) of what might be
<b>Floyd</b> | going on inside the plant, but the original design lacked this element.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (Without Mr. Teeterwaller, the player needed some sort of motivation to
<b>Floyd</b> | break into the plant.  The hijacking scene certainly made it clear that
<b>Floyd</b> | something mysterious was going on, but it didn't by itself give the
<b>Floyd</b> | player any reason to become involved.  To provide this motivation, the
<b>Floyd</b> | original design had a minor character named Major Bennett, who shows up
<b>Floyd</b> | just after the hijacking.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (The hijacking started off pretty much the same as it does in the final
<b>Floyd</b> | game.  After the bulldozers started clearing wreckage, though, Major
<b>Floyd</b> | Bennett shows up...)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The trucks that are still intact start moving into the plant, one by
<b>Floyd</b> | one, as the bulldozers clear a path through the wreckage.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You hear a rustling sound behind you.  You turn to look, and hear a
<b>Floyd</b> | woman's voice yell `Freeze!'  You're so rattled by what you've just
<b>Floyd</b> | seen that you practically jump over the fence with fright.  You quickly
<b>Floyd</b> | raise your hands.  Someone approaches behind you and pats you down for
<b>Floyd</b> | weapons, then withdraws.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | `Turn around, slowly,' the voice says.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You turn around--like she said, slowly--and see a woman in an army
<b>Floyd</b> | uniform pointing a pistol at you.  Her uniform looks like an officer's,
<b>Floyd</b> | which is quickly confirmed when you see that her nameplate reads MAJ.
<b>Floyd</b> | BENNETT--a major.  Her eyes do not blink as she watches you, and her
<b>Floyd</b> | expression is fierce.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | `Who the hell are you?'  she asks.  `Are you part of this operation?'
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;yes
<b>Floyd</b> | She almost laughs.  `I doubt it,' she says dismissively.  She seems to
<b>Floyd</b> | relax a little, having decided you're not a threat.  `Okay, so who are
<b>Floyd</b> | you?'
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You explain about your car trouble, that you're here purely by accident
<b>Floyd</b> | and bad timing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The major nods.  `It may be bad timing for you, but you may be the
<b>Floyd</b> | first bit of good luck I've had today.'  She lowers her gun, then
<b>Floyd</b> | suddenly loses her balance, just managing to grab the fence for
<b>Floyd</b> | support.  You notice for the first time that her left leg is wet--with
<b>Floyd</b> | blood, you realize.  The major slowly lowers herself to the ground, her
<b>Floyd</b> | left leg out straight in front of her.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | `As you can probably see, I've been shot,' she says.  `I'm not going
<b>Floyd</b> | anywhere in this condition.  From the way I feel I doubt I'll even be
<b>Floyd</b> | conscious much longer.  I don't suppose you're a doctor?'  she asks;
<b>Floyd</b> | you can't tell if she's being sarcastic.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;no
<b>Floyd</b> | `There's not much you could have done anyway,' she says.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | `I'd better at least try to stop this bleeding.'  She laboriously takes
<b>Floyd</b> | off her belt, leans forward, wraps it around her leg above the wound
<b>Floyd</b> | and pulls the belt tight.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She leans back against the fence.  She looks exhausted.  `I need your
<b>Floyd</b> | help,' she says, visibly fighting to stay awake.  `Those trucks out
<b>Floyd</b> | there were transporting live nuclear weapons.  I don't know who the
<b>Floyd</b> | hell these people are, but someone has to stop them.'  Her voice drops
<b>Floyd</b> | almost to a whisper.  `Look, I know you're just an innocent bystander
<b>Floyd</b> | here, but you're the only one who can stop them.  Here,' she says,
<b>Floyd</b> | reaching in her pocket and pulling something out; she tries to toss it
<b>Floyd</b> | to you, but she only manages to throw it a couple of feet. `That's the
<b>Floyd</b> | destruct key.  If there's any way you can get in there, find the bombs,
<b>Floyd</b> | use the key--it'll destroy their detonators and render them harmless.'
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | With that, the major slips into unconsciousness, her head falling to
<b>Floyd</b> | her chest and her body going limp.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (The scene concludes pretty much as in the final game.  Of course, the
<b>Floyd</b> | bit about nuclear weapons is just the cover story, as you eventually
<b>Floyd</b> | find out, but now you have a reason to continue with the story.  The
<b>Floyd</b> | destruct key really is the destruct key, though; at the end of the
<b>Floyd</b> | story, you'd have the option of destroying the artifacts, letting the
<b>Floyd</b> | hijackers keep them, or stealing them.)

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (In the first scene involving opening the crate from the truck, when
<b>Floyd</b> | you're viewing events through the vent opening in the air duct, there
<b>Floyd</b> | was originally going to be a force field erected around the crate.
<b>Floyd</b> | This was meant to make it more obvious that this was no ordinary
<b>Floyd</b> | crate.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This aluminum air duct is just large enough to crawl through here, but
<b>Floyd</b> | splits into several smaller ducts to the west, none of which are large
<b>Floyd</b> | enough to permit further passage.  The duct widens to the east.  A vent
<b>Floyd</b> | cover, two feet on a side, is over an opening in the floor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;look in opening
<b>Floyd</b> | A cavernous space the size of an airplane hangar is visible through the
<b>Floyd</b> | opening.  The floor is a hundred feet below.  Equipment of all kinds is
<b>Floyd</b> | scattered throughout the room:  forklifts, generators, machines
<b>Floyd</b> | connected by thick electrical cables running across the floor, welding
<b>Floyd</b> | torches with their gas tanks, rolling racks of power tools, portable
<b>Floyd</b> | arc lights.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In the center of the room is a rectangular area marked with a yellow
<b>Floyd</b> | border painted on the floor, clear of any equipment.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Several workers, dressed in isolation suits and gas masks, are standing
<b>Floyd</b> | just outside the yellow border.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A forklift comes into view and moves toward the center of the floor
<b>Floyd</b> | below, beeping as it slowly carries a silver crate the size of a small
<b>Floyd</b> | car across the room.  The forklift drives into the yellow rectangle and
<b>Floyd</b> | gently sets the crate down in the center.  The forklift backs out and
<b>Floyd</b> | heads out of view.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The workers, still standing just outside the yellow border, turn around
<b>Floyd</b> | and face away from the crate.  Suddenly, a flash of white light, like a
<b>Floyd</b> | reflection of the sun in a mirror, bursts from the yellow border, and a
<b>Floyd</b> | moment later you hear a small thunderclap.  The afterimage takes
<b>Floyd</b> | several seconds to fade from your eyes; once you can see clearly again,
<b>Floyd</b> | you notice that the air around and above the yellow rectangular area is
<b>Floyd</b> | shimmering slightly and has a slight blue glow.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;wait
<b>Floyd</b> | Time passes...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Through the opening in the floor, you see the workers move to different
<b>Floyd</b> | pieces of equipment, setting dials and switches.  After each worker has
<b>Floyd</b> | checked several pieces of equipment, they gather together; they look
<b>Floyd</b> | like they're talking among themselves but you can't hear what they're
<b>Floyd</b> | saying.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The workers seem to conclude their conversation.  They take off their
<b>Floyd</b> | gas masks, then head to a corner of the room and disappear from sight.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (The force field was to have played a part later in the game as well.
<b>Floyd</b> | The observation room was actually going to be a control room, which
<b>Floyd</b> | would have let you turn off the force field, which would in turn would
<b>Floyd</b> | have sent the workers running for cover.  Once the force field had been
<b>Floyd</b> | lowered, of course, you'd have needed an isolation suit of your own to
<b>Floyd</b> | enter the lab.  I removed all of this partially because the game was
<b>Floyd</b> | getting to be long enough without additional puzzles involving the
<b>Floyd</b> | force field and isolation suit, but mostly because it would have robbed
<b>Floyd</b> | the end of the game of its momentum.)

<b>Floyd</b> | (The end of the game was originally going to be rather different from
<b>Floyd</b> | the way it finally turned out.  After you'd seen enough--the records
<b>Floyd</b> | room and the lab in particular--the end-game was to begin with your
<b>Floyd</b> | capture.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A large group of armed guards appears out of nowhere.  Before you
<b>Floyd</b> | realize what's happening, several of the guards wrestle you to the
<b>Floyd</b> | ground and handcuff your hands behind your back.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | `X-Ray five, we've apprehended the subject,' you hear someone say.  An
<b>Floyd</b> | unintelligible voice from a walkie-talkie replies.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The guards pull you to your feet.  You look around and realize that
<b>Floyd</b> | Teeterwaller has disappeared; you're not sure if the guards have
<b>Floyd</b> | already taken him away separately or if he somehow evaded them.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The guards escort you through a series of passages that you haven't
<b>Floyd</b> | seen before, leading you deeper and deeper underground.  Finally, you
<b>Floyd</b> | arrive at a small cell; a guard removes your handcuffs, then locks the
<b>Floyd</b> | door, leaving you alone.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Cell
<b>Floyd</b> |    This is a small room, about eight feet by eight feet; the single
<b>Floyd</b> | exit is a heavy steel door to the south, locked from the outside.
<b>Floyd</b> | Against one wall is an air vent; the only other feature is an air vent
<b>Floyd</b> | in the ceiling.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (A few turns would elapse, allowing you to explore your surroundings,
<b>Floyd</b> | although there wasn't much you could do at this point.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You hear a scraping sound coming from the air vent.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;wait
<b>Floyd</b> | Time passes...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A whisper comes from the air vent.  `Hello, is that you?'  You realize
<b>Floyd</b> | it's Mr. Teeterwaller!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;teeterwaller, hello
<b>Floyd</b> | `We don't have time for that now.'
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | `I'm going to find a way to get you out of here,' Teeterwaller whispers
<b>Floyd</b> | from the air vent.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;open air vent
<b>Floyd</b> | Not surprisingly, the builder didn't use the kind of air vent cover you
<b>Floyd</b> | can open.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The cell door opens.  A guard enters and motions for you to follow.
<b>Floyd</b> | You glance up at the vent, then follow the guard.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Five guards escort you down the hall and into an elevator, which climbs
<b>Floyd</b> | several floors.  You emerge into a plushly furnished room that looks
<b>Floyd</b> | like a country club lounge:  big leather chairs, portraits on the wall,
<b>Floyd</b> | a brick fireplace with smoldering logs.  The guards lead you across the
<b>Floyd</b> | room and through some doors, down a wide hallway, and into a darkened
<b>Floyd</b> | room; all of the guards but one remain outside.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The guard leads you to a chair sitting in a pool of light at the end of
<b>Floyd</b> | a mahogany table.  You sit, and the guard stands behind you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (You'd receive essentially the same lecture from the gray-haired man at
<b>Floyd</b> | this point as in the final end-game sequence.  Eventually, Teeterwaller
<b>Floyd</b> | would have shown up to rescue you, and you'd make your daring escape.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (I saw quickly that this approach wasn't going to work.  The obvious
<b>Floyd</b> | problem was that the gray-haired man simply had no good reason to
<b>Floyd</b> | lecture or cajole you, since you had essentially nothing that he might
<b>Floyd</b> | want.  If you'd already stolen the disk, the guards simply would have
<b>Floyd</b> | taken it when they captured you.  Teeterwaller might have slipped away
<b>Floyd</b> | with it, but that wouldn't leave you with any bargaining power.  This
<b>Floyd</b> | was basically going to be a James Bond end-game, with the evil genius
<b>Floyd</b> | revealing his master plan as the laser beam slowly closes in on Bond,
<b>Floyd</b> | who's strapped to a table.  The device is tired in movies but worse in
<b>Floyd</b> | IF, because of the momentum-destroying effects of a puzzle.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (So, I rearranged the end-game to eliminate the capture, replacing it
<b>Floyd</b> | with an extended chase, leaving the player with a degree of freedom in
<b>Floyd</b> | the final showdown.)
