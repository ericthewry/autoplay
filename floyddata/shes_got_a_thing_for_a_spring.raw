The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>She's Got a Thing for a Spring</i>, written by Brent&nbsp;VanFossen.  <i>She's Got a Thing for a Spring</i> was originally released during the 1997 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took 4th place.  It received XYZZY nominations for Best Writing, Best Setting, Best NPCs, and Best Individual NPC, and ultimately took the XYZZY for Best Individual NPC (for the character of Bob).  We played the updated version, released in February, 2008, which includes a number of changes and updates from the original; if you played the original but haven't played the recent release, you might consider holding off on reading the transcript until you've played yourself, because there are some real treats in the updated release (but that is, of course, entirely up to you!).  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/313"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>, but as of the date of posting this transcript, there's no link to the updated game file.  You can find the 2008 version on the <A HREF="http://mirror.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/spring.z8">IF Archive</A>.</br>

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "She's Got a Thing for a Spring" is a short story, and you are the
<b>Floyd</b> | protagonist. It begins with a short section of text, followed by a
<b>Floyd</b> | prompt where you are invited to type your instructions to the main
<b>Floyd</b> | character in plain English. The game understands about 140 common

<b>Floyd</b> | verbs, and has a vocabulary of more than 1200 words. See the next
<b>Floyd</b> | topic for Instructions for Playing. The game will try to understand
<b>Floyd</b> | what you have typed, and the story progresses as the game reacts to
<b>Floyd</b> | your input.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The goal is simple. Have fun. Experiment. The author has made an

<b>Floyd</b> | effort to anticipate the reasonable inputs of the player, and some
<b>Floyd</b> | that are not so reasonable. The game should react with an appropriate
<b>Floyd</b> | response or action to whatever you type, or will ask you for
<b>Floyd</b> | clarification.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game was written in a language called Inform, which was created

<b>Floyd</b> | by Graham Nelson. It was compiled into a format which can be run on
<b>Floyd</b> | any of a dozen different computer platforms using an interpreter
<b>Floyd</b> | specific to the machine. The various interpreters and Graham's
<b>Floyd</b> | excellent compiler and library can be found on the Interactive Fiction
<b>Floyd</b> | Archive, at <A HREF="http://ifarchive.org">http://ifarchive.org</A> or ftp://ftp.ifarchive.org . There

<b>Floyd</b> | are many other games similar to this one available at the same
<b>Floyd</b> | locations. Anyone interested in discussing game design and theory
<b>Floyd</b> | should check out the newsgroup rec.arts.int-fiction (RAIF). Those
<b>Floyd</b> | interested in discussing games and hints should find
<b>Floyd</b> | rec.games.int-fiction (RGIF) more to their liking.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | This game was created as a birthday gift for Lorelle, the author's
<b>Floyd</b> | wife, and her love of hot springs was the inspiration for the story.
<b>Floyd</b> | The creatures that inhabit the game are those that Brent and Lorelle
<b>Floyd</b> | have had the pleasure of watching, and many of the situations in the
<b>Floyd</b> | game come from real experiences. Even the main character, Bob, is
<b>Floyd</b> | based to some extent on real people from the real world, although the

<b>Floyd</b> | specific details are pure fiction.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "She's Got a Thing for a Spring" won 4th place in the 1997 Interactive
<b>Floyd</b> | Fiction Competition. It was nominated for four XYZZY awards in 1997:
<b>Floyd</b> | Best Writing, Best Setting, Best NPCs, and Best Individual NPC. It won
<b>Floyd</b> | the award for Best Individual NPC, Bob.

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The author has made an attempt to simplify conversing with NPCs (non
<b>Floyd</b> | player characters). Specifically, the game remembers who is the
<b>Floyd</b> | current target of your conversations, and also what the last type of
<b>Floyd</b> | command to that npc was. Then, for future conversations, that
<b>Floyd</b> | information does not have to be typed again. This should simplify and
<b>Floyd</b> | streamline the tedium of typing and allow the player to concentrate on

<b>Floyd</b> | what is being asked or said. For example:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see Bob here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;ask bob about cabin
<b>Floyd</b> | "I love my cabin," Bob says to you, adjusting the photograph. "I've

<b>Floyd</b> | lived here for a couple of years."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;photograph
<b>Floyd</b> | "This old picture?" he smiles. "That's my mother and her sisters."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;i

<b>Floyd</b> | You are carrying:
<b>Floyd</b> |   an invitation to a party
<b>Floyd</b> |   a fake fur hat
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;show the invitation to Bob
<b>Floyd</b> | "I wouldn't miss that if I were you," he says with a wink.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;hat
<b>Floyd</b> | "You might put that on, my dear," he says with concern. "The wind's
<b>Floyd</b> | blowing, and you should keep warm."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Suddenly, Bob turns toward the cabin. "Would you like something to

<b>Floyd</b> | eat?" he asks you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;yes
<b>Floyd</b> | "Great! Follow me inside, we'll have lunch," he says as he disappears
<b>Floyd</b> | into the cabin.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | As in the last command, any statement that is not recognized by the
<b>Floyd</b> | game as a valid verb is interpreted to be a statement to the npc, if
<b>Floyd</b> | he's present. Some verbs (like yes) also work this way. So the player
<b>Floyd</b> | can simply type "yes" instead of "say yes to Bob", although that will
<b>Floyd</b> | also work. There is a meta command "npc" which will tell you, the
<b>Floyd</b> | player, what the game remembers as the current npc and the current

<b>Floyd</b> | verb type. At the end of the previous command, if you type:
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | &gt;npc
<b>Floyd</b> | The current npc is Bob.
<b>Floyd</b> | The current verb type is 'show'.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This was an experiment in an attempt to simplify NPC conversations.
<b>Floyd</b> | The author would appreciate any comments. Did this work?  Was it
<b>Floyd</b> | confusing?  How could it be improved?  Please email Brent VanFossen

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 2 was only available on the CU Amiga Covermount CDrom

<b>Floyd</b> | "This is it!" he says as he dodges the last pothole and brings the
<b>Floyd</b> | truck to a stop. After twenty miles of the worst washboard road the
<b>Floyd</b> | country has to offer, you're just happy to have arrived.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You place your sandaled feet on solid ground and take a deep breath.
<b>Floyd</b> | The smells of autumn are at once sweet and earthy and full of the
<b>Floyd</b> | aroma of moisture and living things. A cool breeze blows in your face,
<b>Floyd</b> | soft and gentle. What a nice change, what a welcome relief from the
<b>Floyd</b> | tension and hustle of all you've left behind this weekend. It's just

<b>Floyd</b> | you and your husband, as he promised over a month ago.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You look around. What passes for the road you just traveled ends
<b>Floyd</b> | abruptly here. Over the last hour, bad asphalt gave way to gravel,
<b>Floyd</b> | which gave way, in turn, to the rutted two-track you see beside you.
<b>Floyd</b> | Ahead, the ruts continue, but it'll be on foot if you're to go any

<b>Floyd</b> | further. The old beater truck stands here, engine off but still
<b>Floyd</b> | ticking from the trip. Your husband closes the driver's door and comes
<b>Floyd</b> | around the rear to join you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "How's my pretty lady?" he asks as he wraps his arms around you and
<b>Floyd</b> | places a kiss on your cheek from behind. "Tired, huh? Come on. Let's

<b>Floyd</b> | get the stuff. We'll be able to relax better once the tent's up."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | He takes the two packs from the back of the truck and helps you into
<b>Floyd</b> | yours, then leads the way through the brush to the north. You roll up
<b>Floyd</b> | on the balls of your feet and give your pack a nudge, then pull the
<b>Floyd</b> | waist strap tight. Without looking back, you follow.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | That was last night, and you hiked a short trail to a campsite off in
<b>Floyd</b> | the woods. Together you set up the tent, fixed a quick dinner, and
<b>Floyd</b> | fell asleep in each other's arms...

<b>Floyd</b> | You wake with a start, something's missing, and you notice the
<b>Floyd</b> | sleeping bag is empty beside you. On his pillow is a handwritten note,
<b>Floyd</b> | which you collect. He must have crawled out early, as the sky is only
<b>Floyd</b> | now beginning to lighten.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You dress quickly, slip out of the tent, and follow the trail to the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Aspen Grove
<b>Floyd</b> | You stand in the middle of a grove of aspen, which extends in all

<b>Floyd</b> | directions. Slender white trunks reach for the sky with long thin
<b>Floyd</b> | fingers, stroking the clouds that blow in the autumn breeze. Leaves of
<b>Floyd</b> | gold rattle as the winds shift, and here and there one floats to the
<b>Floyd</b> | ground to join others that crackle underfoot when you move. A narrow
<b>Floyd</b> | path disappears east into the trees, and a camping area is visible
<b>Floyd</b> | through a small opening to the west. North is a wide meadow.

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The tent is right where you left it, of course, on a bed of leaves

<b>Floyd</b> | a meadow to the north. A path leads east.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A large bull elk and his harem sit in the shade in front of the tent.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | From the north, an eerie bugle rises above the wind and the rattling

</TD><td></td><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | Latin name: Cervus elaphus
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The elk is a large member of the deer family, and is common in the
<b>Floyd</b> | mountainous regions of the United States and Canada. Also known as the
<b>Floyd</b> | wapiti after a Shawnee Indian word for "white rump", it is slightly

<b>Floyd</b> | larger than the European red deer. Its appearance and behavior is
<b>Floyd</b> | similar, as well. As a point of further confusion in naming, elk is
<b>Floyd</b> | the European name for the moose. For scientists, therefore, the
<b>Floyd</b> | preferred name for this animal is wapiti, but that has not caught the
<b>Floyd</b> | public's favor.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Males stand about four and a half feet at the shoulder, and weigh up
<b>Floyd</b> | to 1300 pounds. Females are 10 percent smaller. They have a long head
<b>Floyd</b> | and neck, which is dark brown. The rest of the animal is lighter
<b>Floyd</b> | brown, except for the rump patch and small tail that are buffy in
<b>Floyd</b> | color.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The elk are grazing and herding animals, and are found in the forest
<b>Floyd</b> | and prairies in groups of up to about 50 animals in Canada, larger
<b>Floyd</b> | groups in the U.S. Females and immatures usually keep together, the
<b>Floyd</b> | males preferring a lone lifestyle or only a few associates, except in
<b>Floyd</b> | the fall, when they join and collect a harem of females for mating.
<b>Floyd</b> | This time of year, called the rut, they can be quite aggressive and

<b>Floyd</b> | dangerous, as they consider anything not a female elk to be an
<b>Floyd</b> | opponent.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The males are commonly known as "bulls", although the term "stag" also
<b>Floyd</b> | applies, and the females are called "cows" or "hinds". Males grow
<b>Floyd</b> | large antlers each year beginning in April, and shed them in February

<b>Floyd</b> | or March. Antlers can grow up to 5 feet long and weigh 45 pounds.
<b>Floyd</b> | Their eerie bugle call can be heard for up to half a mile, announcing
<b>Floyd</b> | the dominance of a large male or as a challenge to another.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You hear it again, a wild bugling to the east.

<b>Floyd</b> | Homestead
<b>Floyd</b> | The years have not been kind to this remnant of the past, although the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the porch is an oak rocking chair.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You can see Bob here, sweeping his porch.

<b>Floyd</b> | He sweeps a bit more, all the while looking at you. "I wonder why they

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | More often heard than seen, they will announce their presence with a
<b>Floyd</b> | high-pitched nasal "neep!" from a vantage on one of the larger rocks

<b>Floyd</b> | in their territory. As their coloration blends with their habitat,
<b>Floyd</b> | varying from brown to gray, they are often difficult to spot. A
<b>Floyd</b> | patient observer, however, can watch them on their many trips to the
<b>Floyd</b> | nearby vegetation along one of their several paths. After a few

<b>Floyd</b> | that aid it in reaching the tender vegetation which grows at the
<b>Floyd</b> | bottom of lakes and ponds or higher on trees than other animals can
<b>Floyd</b> | browse. One of its favorite foods is the branches and twigs of the
<b>Floyd</b> | willow.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Its pelage is dark brown, slightly lighter underneath. When wet, it
<b>Floyd</b> | usually appears black. Males stand six feet high at the shoulder, and
<b>Floyd</b> | weigh up to 1600 pounds. Females are 10 percent smaller. The large
<b>Floyd</b> | palmate antlers grow only on the males and are shed in the early
<b>Floyd</b> | months of each year. They begin growing again immediately, and each
<b>Floyd</b> | year grow larger, so that their size indicates approximate age and

<b>Floyd</b> | maturity. An unusual feature of the male is the bell, a flap of furred
<b>Floyd</b> | skin that hangs from the neck. Its purpose is unknown.

<b>Floyd</b> | The moose breaks into a trot, head lowered directly at you, and

<b>Floyd</b> | Latin name: Cervus elaphus
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The elk is a large member of the deer family, and is common in the
<b>Floyd</b> | mountainous regions of the United States and Canada. Also known as the
<b>Floyd</b> | wapiti after a Shawnee Indian word for "white rump", it is slightly
<b>Floyd</b> | larger than the European red deer. Its appearance and behavior is
<b>Floyd</b> | similar, as well. As a point of further confusion in naming, elk is
<b>Floyd</b> | the European name for the moose. For scientists, therefore, the

<b>Floyd</b> | preferred name for this animal is wapiti, but that has not caught the
<b>Floyd</b> | public's favor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Males stand about four and a half feet at the shoulder, and weigh up
<b>Floyd</b> | to 1300 pounds. Females are 10 percent smaller. They have a long head
<b>Floyd</b> | and neck, which is dark brown. The rest of the animal is lighter

<b>Floyd</b> | brown, except for the rump patch and small tail that are buffy in
<b>Floyd</b> | color.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The elk are grazing and herding animals, and are found in the forest
<b>Floyd</b> | and prairies in groups of up to about 50 animals in Canada, larger
<b>Floyd</b> | groups in the U.S. Females and immatures usually keep together, the

<b>Floyd</b> | males preferring a lone lifestyle or only a few associates, except in
<b>Floyd</b> | the fall, when they join and collect a harem of females for mating.
<b>Floyd</b> | This time of year, called the rut, they can be quite aggressive and
<b>Floyd</b> | dangerous, as they consider anything not a female elk to be an
<b>Floyd</b> | opponent.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The males are commonly known as "bulls", although the term "stag" also
<b>Floyd</b> | applies, and the females are called "cows" or "hinds". Males grow
<b>Floyd</b> | large antlers each year beginning in April, and shed them in February
<b>Floyd</b> | or March. Antlers can grow up to 5 feet long and weigh 45 pounds.
<b>Floyd</b> | Their eerie bugle call can be heard for up to half a mile, announcing
<b>Floyd</b> | the dominance of a large male or as a challenge to another.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The bull moose, sensing your indecision, moves quickly, lifts you with
<b>Floyd</b> | an antler, and tosses you easily onto the sharpest boulder in sight.

<b>Floyd</b> | Latin name: Cinclus mexicanus
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The American dipper, occasionally called the water ouzel, is common

<b>Floyd</b> | along fast-moving mountain streams. It is a round, gray bird with a
<b>Floyd</b> | short tail and large yellow legs. Its voice is a trill in flight, and
<b>Floyd</b> | sings at rest with cheeps, buzzes, whistles, and warbles.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A distinguishing behavior, making it a most interesting bird to watch,
<b>Floyd</b> | is its ability to walk on the bottom of the fastest-moving stream,

<b>Floyd</b> | apparently unaffected by the current. Then, it will jump out of the
<b>Floyd</b> | water onto a moss-covered boulder, and bob and curtsey in place, with
<b>Floyd</b> | aquatic larvae, snails, or tiny fish in its mouth.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | It has enormous oil glands for waterproofing feathers, flaps to seal
<b>Floyd</b> | its nostrils, and heavy nictitating membranes (transparent extra

<b>Floyd</b> | eyelids) which aid in its regular dives. The dipper breeds in the
<b>Floyd</b> | early spring, building a domed nest of ferns and fine mosses, which it
<b>Floyd</b> | hides in a rock crevice in a streamside cliff. Often, nests will be
<b>Floyd</b> | placed completely out of harm's way under an overhang behind a
<b>Floyd</b> | waterfall. They lay usually 4 to 5 eggs, which hatch in 16 days.
<b>Floyd</b> | Lifespan is 2 to 5 years.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The dipper jumps into the water with hardly a splash and walks along
<b>Floyd</b> | the bottom.

<b>Floyd</b> | Behind the Cabin
<b>Floyd</b> | The north side of the cabin is plain and unpretentious; not even a
<b>Floyd</b> | window provides a view in. A stone chimney forms most of the wall of

<b>Floyd</b> | the cabin. In the clearing here is a traditional antique outhouse,
<b>Floyd</b> | complete with a crescent moon. A wooden shed sits off to the side and

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Homestead

<b>Floyd</b> | The years have not been kind to this remnant of the past, although the
<b>Floyd</b> | obviously recent repairs hide the worst of the scars. An old-fashioned
<b>Floyd</b> | log cabin occupies an opening in the woods, door swung open onto the
<b>Floyd</b> | wide front porch. The single window looks out onto the clearing, alert
<b>Floyd</b> | and watchful, with a country plaid curtain that flutters in the
<b>Floyd</b> | breeze. A trail leaves to the south and continues around the cabin to

<b>Floyd</b> | the north.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the porch is an oak rocking chair.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The elk is a large member of the deer family, and is common in the
<b>Floyd</b> | mountainous regions of the United States and Canada. Also known as the
<b>Floyd</b> | wapiti after a Shawnee Indian word for "white rump", it is slightly
<b>Floyd</b> | larger than the European red deer. Its appearance and behavior is
<b>Floyd</b> | similar, as well. As a point of further confusion in naming, elk is
<b>Floyd</b> | the European name for the moose. For scientists, therefore, the

<b>Floyd</b> | preferred name for this animal is wapiti, but that has not caught the
<b>Floyd</b> | public's favor.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Males stand about four and a half feet at the shoulder, and weigh up
<b>Floyd</b> | to 1300 pounds. Females are 10 percent smaller. They have a long head
<b>Floyd</b> | and neck, which is dark brown. The rest of the animal is lighter

<b>Floyd</b> | brown, except for the rump patch and small tail that are buffy in
<b>Floyd</b> | color.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The elk are grazing and herding animals, and are found in the forest
<b>Floyd</b> | and prairies in groups of up to about 50 animals in Canada, larger
<b>Floyd</b> | groups in the U.S. Females and immatures usually keep together, the

<b>Floyd</b> | males preferring a lone lifestyle or only a few associates, except in
<b>Floyd</b> | the fall, when they join and collect a harem of females for mating.
<b>Floyd</b> | This time of year, called the rut, they can be quite aggressive and
<b>Floyd</b> | dangerous, as they consider anything not a female elk to be an
<b>Floyd</b> | opponent.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The males are commonly known as "bulls", although the term "stag" also
<b>Floyd</b> | applies, and the females are called "cows" or "hinds". Males grow
<b>Floyd</b> | large antlers each year beginning in April, and shed them in February
<b>Floyd</b> | or March. Antlers can grow up to 5 feet long and weigh 45 pounds.
<b>Floyd</b> | Their eerie bugle call can be heard for up to half a mile, announcing
<b>Floyd</b> | the dominance of a large male or as a challenge to another.

<b>Floyd</b> | with the smell of salt. This same tent was new then, and you laughed

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The tent is only slightly roomier inside than it would appear. Two can

<b>Floyd</b> | sleep comfortably here, side-by-side or like spoons, with only enough

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The moose is the largest member of the deer family, and is common in
<b>Floyd</b> | subalpine meadows and marshes of the northern United States and
<b>Floyd</b> | Canada. So ugly it is almost cute, it has a large muzzle and long legs
<b>Floyd</b> | that aid it in reaching the tender vegetation which grows at the
<b>Floyd</b> | bottom of lakes and ponds or higher on trees than other animals can
<b>Floyd</b> | browse. One of its favorite foods is the branches and twigs of the

<b>Floyd</b> | willow.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Its pelage is dark brown, slightly lighter underneath. When wet, it
<b>Floyd</b> | usually appears black. Males stand six feet high at the shoulder, and
<b>Floyd</b> | weigh up to 1600 pounds. Females are 10 percent smaller. The large
<b>Floyd</b> | palmate antlers grow only on the males and are shed in the early

<b>Floyd</b> | months of each year. They begin growing again immediately, and each
<b>Floyd</b> | year grow larger, so that their size indicates approximate age and
<b>Floyd</b> | maturity. An unusual feature of the male is the bell, a flap of furred
<b>Floyd</b> | skin that hangs from the neck. Its purpose is unknown.

<b>Floyd</b> | Homestead
<b>Floyd</b> | The years have not been kind to this remnant of the past, although the

<b>Floyd</b> | wide front porch. The single window looks out onto the clearing, alert
<b>Floyd</b> | and watchful, with a country plaid curtain that flutters in the
<b>Floyd</b> | breeze. A trail leaves to the south and continues around the cabin to

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Boulder Pile
<b>Floyd</b> | You are at the edge of a large field of pink granite boulders. Lichens

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The moose breaks into a trot, head lowered directly at you, and

<b>Floyd</b> | Granite Canyon
<b>Floyd</b> | You're on a shelf overlooking a small canyon, apparently carved by the

<b>Floyd</b> | overlooking the stream below. Above you, granite walls continue to

<b>Floyd</b> | rise, the pink stones a beautiful contrast to the clear blue sky. An
<b>Floyd</b> | animal trail leads up, too steep to walk, but you might be able to

<b>Floyd</b> | Latin name: Ochotona princeps
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The pika is a small mammal related to the rabbits and hares, and is
<b>Floyd</b> | about the size of a hamster, with round ears and no tail. It lives in
<b>Floyd</b> | rock piles at elevations above 4000 feet, and does not hibernate. As

<b>Floyd</b> | winters can be long in the mountains, the summer and fall months are
<b>Floyd</b> | spent gathering vegetation, which is set out to dry in "haystacks".
<b>Floyd</b> | The dried forage is then stored away as food for the winter months.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | More often heard than seen, they will announce their presence with a
<b>Floyd</b> | high-pitched nasal "neep!" from a vantage on one of the larger rocks

<b>Floyd</b> | in their territory. As their coloration blends with their habitat,
<b>Floyd</b> | varying from brown to gray, they are often difficult to spot. A
<b>Floyd</b> | patient observer, however, can watch them on their many trips to the
<b>Floyd</b> | nearby vegetation along one of their several paths. After a few
<b>Floyd</b> | moment's time, they return to the rock pile, flowers and herbs
<b>Floyd</b> | crosswise in their mouth, and deposit their gatherings on the top of

<b>Floyd</b> | You're on a shelf overlooking a small canyon, apparently carved by the

<b>Floyd</b> | The Meteor, the Stone and a Long Glass of Sherbet
<b>Floyd</b> | by Angela M. Horns
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Another day wasted as guest of the Empress, a wretchedly long tour of
<b>Floyd</b> | the breath-taking Boreal Falls, conducted as ever by the Lady Amilia.
<b>Floyd</b> | As if she weren't bad enough, an honour guard of soldiers, their

<b>Floyd</b> | breast-plates red in the setting sun, march ahead of the procession
<b>Floyd</b> | and protect you from seeing anything unrehearsed. It's a dog's life
<b>Floyd</b> | being an Ambassador.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The story continues, and you turn the page. There's nothing like a
<b>Floyd</b> | good book at a hot spring.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Hey, hon. Glad to see you found it. Sorry I couldn't be here sooner,"
<b>Floyd</b> | he says, as he steps near the pool. "You're more beautiful every time
<b>Floyd</b> | I look at you. I always seem to forget." His smile widens.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And then, so slowly at first that you aren't even sure when you

<b>Floyd</b> | notice, you become aware of the sounds around you. The bubbling of the
<b>Floyd</b> | hot spring. The relentlessly happy sounds of a robin in the distance.
<b>Floyd</b> | The soothing murmur of the stream as it flows over the worn stones
<b>Floyd</b> | that line its bed. "I love the noises here, the music of the
<b>Floyd</b> | wilderness," he comments, as if reading your thoughts. "And this
<b>Floyd</b> | little spring is completely private, I've taken care of that." With a

<b>Floyd</b> | wink, he steps toward you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In anticipation, you wait, the memories coming back in a flood. The
<b>Floyd</b> | trips together, weekend after weekend. The good friends and all the
<b>Floyd</b> | happy times. Slowly, deliberately, he starts to undress. And as many
<b>Floyd</b> | times as you've seen this, you can't help but watch. Each garment

<b>Floyd</b> | comes off to drop at his side, his clothes on yours. The last one
<b>Floyd</b> | removed, he smiles and steps into the pool.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your mind swirls like the water around you. He snuggles up close and
<b>Floyd</b> | takes your hand. All the tension goes, all the stress and frustrations
<b>Floyd</b> | leave. Gently, slowly, he takes you completely in his arms and pulls

<b>Floyd</b> | Hot Spring

<b>Floyd</b> | There is nothing on this planet more pleasant than an outdoor bath in
<b>Floyd</b> | a 104 degree pool. Steam surrounds you in an ethereal massage. Tufa
<b>Floyd</b> | deposits line the steep walls behind you and brilliant green algae
<b>Floyd</b> | decorate the rock where the spring trickles in. A few bubbles and a
<b>Floyd</b> | small current rise from the depths, massaging your tired body in all
<b>Floyd</b> | the right places.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The bird flies quickly downstream, dodging rocks and roots, and
<b>Floyd</b> | disappears.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You soak for a few minutes, and wish for the soothing fragrance of
<b>Floyd</b> | eucalyptus, your favorite scent.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Hey, hon. Glad to see you found it. Sorry I couldn't be here sooner,"
<b>Floyd</b> | he says, as he steps near the pool. "You're more beautiful every time
<b>Floyd</b> | I look at you. I always seem to forget." His smile widens.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | And then, so slowly at first that you aren't even sure when you

<b>Floyd</b> | The soothing murmur of the stream as it flows over the worn stones
<b>Floyd</b> | that line its bed. "I love the noises here, the music of the

<b>Floyd</b> | wink, he steps toward you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | In anticipation, you wait, the memories coming back in a flood. The
<b>Floyd</b> | trips together, weekend after weekend. The good friends and all the
<b>Floyd</b> | happy times. Slowly, deliberately, he starts to undress. And as many
<b>Floyd</b> | times as you've seen this, you can't help but watch. Each garment

<b>Floyd</b> | comes off to drop at his side, his clothes on yours. The last one
<b>Floyd</b> | removed, he smiles and steps into the pool.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your mind swirls like the water around you. He snuggles up close and
<b>Floyd</b> | takes your hand. All the tension goes, all the stress and frustrations

<b>Floyd</b> | Release 2, 3, and 4:

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Release 2 was only available on the CU Amiga Covermount CDrom
<b>Floyd</b> | published in 1998. Release 3 quite possibly never escaped the author's

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This is a list of the changes that have been made to the program since

<b>Floyd</b> | its first appearance in the 1997 IF Competition. I'm sure there are
<b>Floyd</b> | other differences that I've forgotten. Thanks again to all who
<b>Floyd</b> | commented or sent bug reports. I believe I have fixed all the known
<b>Floyd</b> | bugs and implemented almost all of the suggestions. The list serves as
<b>Floyd</b> | a rough chronology of the revision process.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "SHE'S GOT A THING FOR A SPRING" is a relatively large game, and I've
<b>Floyd</b> | included here the data from the compiler for your reference. In
<b>Floyd</b> | addition to this, let me just say that the source has nearly 17000
<b>Floyd</b> | lines of code. Of this, approximately 5000 lines deal with the main

<b>Floyd</b> | NPC, Bob, and the objects that he directly manipulates. He can make
<b>Floyd</b> | more than 400 independent moves during the course of a game. There are
<b>Floyd</b> | more than 100 topics that he will respond to, and each topic has 3 or
<b>Floyd</b> | 4 synonyms. His responses often vary depending on the current
<b>Floyd</b> | situation, and sometimes with the time of day.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Bob received a XYZZY award for Best Individual NPC in 1997. "She's Got
<b>Floyd</b> | a Thing for a Spring" was also nominated for three other XYZZYs: Best
<b>Floyd</b> | Writing, Best Setting, and Best NPCs.
