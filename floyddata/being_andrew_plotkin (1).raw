The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Being Andrew Plotkin</i>, written by J. Robinson Wheeler.  <I>Being Andrew Plotkin</I> was originally released as part of the 2000 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took third place. It went on to be nominated for six Xyzzy Awards, including Best Story, Best Individual PC, Best Individual NPC, and Best Individual Puzzle, ultimately winning the Xyzzies for Best NPCs and Best Game.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Being_Andrew_Plotkin'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | (sixteenth place in the last IF Comp, a good improvement from 33rd

<b>Floyd</b> | Weird! You're inside Zarf's head!You see the opening of Zarf's eyes,

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Inside of Zarf's head, you see weird flashes of light. A number of

<b>Floyd</b> | File Room
<b>Floyd</b> | The file room is an unimpressive rectangular room full of squat
<b>Floyd</b> | cabinets. The file cabinets are a pale yellow, like raw milk, and each
<b>Floyd</b> | stands about 38 inches high. There is a maladjusted ceiling tile, and
<b>Floyd</b> | scruffy stains on the padded carpeting. In the north wall is a window,
<b>Floyd</b> | about two and a half feet square, with a crank latch. A copier machine
<b>Floyd</b> | sits near the wall, bearing no make or marking that you recognize, even
<b>Floyd</b> | though no company produces generic photocopiers that you know of. Even
<b>Floyd</b> | more curiously, the wall socket behind it is empty, meaning that the
<b>Floyd</b> | copier is not plugged in, and yet it definitely seems to be turned on.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Peter pulls the second cabinet from the end away from the wall,
<b>Floyd</b> | revealing a portal fashioned from slats of aged cedar. Ornate brass
<b>Floyd</b> | hinges, possibly hand-crafted, clamp the door securely to the wall.
<b>Floyd</b> | Beyond being bizarre, it is curiously anachronistic. The portal itself
<b>Floyd</b> | antedates this building by at least a century and a half, in your

<b>Floyd</b> | Inside Zarf's Brain (as Peter)
<b>Floyd</b> | The noise is really loud here, and there is more to see. A visual
<b>Floyd</b> | juxtaposition mars your sense of place. The walls are angular but
<b>Floyd</b> | smooth, are a warm red, living rock, are cold dead clay and calcite.
<b>Floyd</b> | Cave tunnels lead in all directions, but without a compass or a way to
<b>Floyd</b> | mark your trail, you sense that you could easily get lost.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see a control panel, Valerie and Zarf here.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There is a sound like a vacuum implosion, and a flash of light. Melvin
<b>Floyd</b> | tumbles into view, holding some sort of ray gun.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "He's got a gun!" shouts Valerie.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Zarf says, "Follow me, please."
