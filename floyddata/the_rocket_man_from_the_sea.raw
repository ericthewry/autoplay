					<span class="fontish smaller">The idea behind ClubFloyd
						is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of 
						people meet online to cooperatively play a game of 
						interactive fiction.<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>Retro-Nemesis</em> written by Robb Sherwin, 
						
						and <em>The Rocket Man from the Sea</em> written by Janos Honkonen.
						Retro-Nemesis hails from the Hugo "Open House" competition at the end of 2011, and Rocket Man was the first-place winner in the 2012 Spring Thing. 
						
						You can learn more about the games, including how to download them, by visiting

<tr><td class="room game"><pre><b>Floyd</b> | The Hugo MiniComp is a sort of interactive fiction-based gathering of
<b>Floyd</b> | developers, originally the brainchild of Jon Blask on the ifMud.
<b>Floyd</b> | Download all the Hugo MiniComp games from [<a href="http://www.joltcountry.com">LINK</A>],
<b>Floyd</b> | or try searching on the Interactive Fiction Database at TADS.org
<b>Floyd</b> | ([<a href="http://ifdb.tads.org">LINK</A>]).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | This game, Retro-Nemesis, was originally a piece of static fiction
<b>Floyd</b> | that I wrote for Jason Scott, to be included on the discs for his
<b>Floyd</b> | documentary <span class="floydstyle em">Get Lamp</span>. Jason had requested that I write a
<b>Floyd</b> | crazy little text file about what the filming of the movie
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">might</span> have been like. He was going to include it in a 'hidden
<b>Floyd</b> | in plain sight' directory to see if anyone found it. It was hidden so
<b>Floyd</b> | well that the duplicators assumed he didn't want it included on the
<b>Floyd</b> | discs at all. Rather than let the story be lost to time, I have tried
<b>Floyd</b> | to rework it for the Hugo MiniComp. As such, there are vast oceans of
<b>Floyd</b> | text broken up by a valid move or two.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To talk to people in the game, just use TALK TO JASON and so forth.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can download my other games at Jolt Country, and I hope you enjoy
<b>Floyd</b> | the Hugo MiniComp! For more information on programming in games in
<b>Floyd</b> | Hugo, try [<a href="http://www.generalcoffee.com">LINK</A>], or the <span class="floydstyle em">Hugo by</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Example</span> website at [<a href="http://hugo.gerynarsabode.org.">LINK</A>]
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The original story was proofread by my friend Zseni. Any subsequent
<b>Floyd</b> | errors are mine in this translation, because she had it quite perfect.
<b>Floyd</b> | Rob O'Hara tested it. Thanks, Rob!

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">The Tattoo Parlor</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | I'm in a tattoo parlor, getting the <span class="floydstyle em">Zork</span> logo inked on my
<b>Floyd</b> | forearm, in order to get more screen time for the "GET LAMP"
<b>Floyd</b> | documentary. Jason Scott is here, grinning like the Sentient Demon Sun
<b>Floyd</b> | on the day mankind slowly discerns that there has always been a
<b>Floyd</b> | second, sentient, demon sun. He switched the original "Zork" logo the
<b>Floyd</b> | artist was using for reference with the one from <span class="floydstyle em">Zork III</span>
<b>Floyd</b> | when the guy was self-administrating a body shot. I'm no stranger to
<b>Floyd</b> | drinking on the job, but the artist pooled the booze in the  "o" of
<b>Floyd</b> | his self-stenciled "MOM" tattoo before lighting it on fire. So I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | sufficiently distracted to where I don't realize that the guy is
<b>Floyd</b> | painfully drawing in extra Roman numerals until it's too late.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Scott's filming the whole thing, panning up to my grimacing. The
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Zork</span> logo is made up of a bunch of little rocks, and the
<b>Floyd</b> | surface area for the extra ones is greater than that of a big batch of
<b>Floyd</b> | Safeway-Brand discount popcorn chicken. I can't even remember why
<b>Floyd</b> | "being on film" was so important to me, except that I wanted more
<b>Floyd</b> | exposure than Kent Tessman, CM, that smug bastard. Scott had a deal
<b>Floyd</b> | for me: First, help him break into Adam Thornton's second home in
<b>Floyd</b> | Canada, so we can film ourselves torching the place in order to
<b>Floyd</b> | dramatize the ending of Trinity. And secondly, be the subject for "the
<b>Floyd</b> | tattoo scene" to show how crazy text game fans are. I'd get featured
<b>Floyd</b> | in seven extra clips by doing all this.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "How many clips am I in now?" I asked. I'm fucking shrewd, just look
<b>Floyd</b> | at me. If it were like four or something, well, I'm no fool. Four
<b>Floyd</b> | clips is enough to splice together a Youtube video with and get some
<b>Floyd</b> | thoughtful comments, maybe even some that don't bash women, wets or
<b>Floyd</b> | Jews.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "This many," he said, holding up a copy of <span class="floydstyle em">Zork Zero</span> with his
<b>Floyd</b> | hand over the "Zork" part. Fuck!

<b>Floyd</b> | "Are you sure he will be alright?" asks mother, struggling under the
<b>Floyd</b> | weight of the crate she's lifting to the boat. Your father glances at
<b>Floyd</b> | you, one foot on the side of the boat, and harrumphs.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 'When I was his age I minded the station alone for days' he says,
<b>Floyd</b> | taking the crate effortlessly from your mother, who leans back
<b>Floyd</b> | pressing her palms against the small of her back. "And there were
<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">ships</span> back then." The weight of the crate makes the boat rock
<b>Floyd</b> | lazily, and you glance at the scummy black water between the boat's
<b>Floyd</b> | side and the concrete pier.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You will do alright, won't you, son?" You look up quickly and meet
<b>Floyd</b> | your father's gaze. He has that expression you don't like, his eyes
<b>Floyd</b> | make you squirm and feel nervous; like you have already disappointed
<b>Floyd</b> | him and there will be a belt or a switch in store for you when they
<b>Floyd</b> | get back home.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "No sir! I mean yes sir, I will do my best," you stammer over the
<b>Floyd</b> | creak and squeal of the seagulls circling above you, hopeful for a
<b>Floyd</b> | fish or an unminded crate of food. Father sighs and helps your mother
<b>Floyd</b> | into the boat. Gogol is on the pier, looking at your parents and the
<b>Floyd</b> | seagulls, tail wagging and tongue lolling out in the breeze.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The engine roars to life, hitting you with a quickly dissipating
<b>Floyd</b> | headachy and sweet cloud of exhaust, and as it does, for a moment you
<b>Floyd</b> | feel really scared and alone. Mother waves at you, you wave back and

<b>Floyd</b> | The pier is built in the end of a breakwater that protects the natural

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The sky and the sea is hazy, there is a hard westerly wind and you can

<b>Floyd</b> | tall yellow building used by the pilots in your grandfather's time.
<b>Floyd</b> | Well, there's the navigational cairn on the high northern end of the

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the pier there's a windbeaten equipment shack, where you store

<b>Floyd</b> | The boat shore is actually the innermost nook of the small bay where
<b>Floyd</b> | you swim in the summertime. It's a small nook with some reeds and
<b>Floyd</b> | water plants, and a nice gravely sea bottom without any sharp rocks to
<b>Floyd</b> | hurt your bare feet on. The wavebreak protects the bay, so the water
<b>Floyd</b> | is usually pretty calm and sometimes it gets really warm in the
<b>Floyd</b> | summer. There's a small wooden boat, but nobody has used it in a long
<b>Floyd</b> | time since you can't go to the sea with it, just row around the bay
<b>Floyd</b> | and very close to the island.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your house and the yard is to the southwest and the wavebreak
<b>Floyd</b> | stretches to the east, towards the mainland. Straight to the west are
<b>Floyd</b> | your mother's rose bushes, that hug the side of the house, but you
<b>Floyd</b> | really don't want to go through them because the thorns are sharp
<b>Floyd</b> | enough to bite even through your clothes. The roses are in bloom and
<b>Floyd</b> | gusts of wind wafts their sweet smell to you. You can see something
<b>Floyd</b> | white and plasticky behind the bushes.

<b>Floyd</b> | An idea! You lift the pole almost straight up, and let it fall towards

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The hook hits the rocket man straight in the helmet visor, leaving a

<b>Floyd</b> | The boat shore is actually the innermost nook of the small bay where
<b>Floyd</b> | you swim in the summertime. It's a small nook with some reeds and
<b>Floyd</b> | water plants, and a nice gravely sea bottom without any sharp rocks to
<b>Floyd</b> | hurt your bare feet on. The wavebreak protects the bay, so the water
<b>Floyd</b> | is usually pretty calm and sometimes it gets really warm in the
<b>Floyd</b> | summer. There's a small wooden boat, but nobody has used it in a long
<b>Floyd</b> | time since you can't go to the sea with it, just row around the bay
<b>Floyd</b> | and very close to the island.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your house and the yard is to the southwest and the wavebreak
<b>Floyd</b> | stretches to the east, towards the mainland. Straight to the west are
<b>Floyd</b> | your mother's rose bushes, that hug the side of the house, but you
<b>Floyd</b> | really don't want to go through them because the thorns are sharp
<b>Floyd</b> | enough to bite even through your clothes. The roses are in bloom and
<b>Floyd</b> | gusts of wind wafts their sweet smell to you.

<b>Floyd</b> | The thundering of the waves is ear-splitting in this end of the
<b>Floyd</b> | island, and the air is full of the salty mist of their breaking. In
<b>Floyd</b> | the south the island has no clear waterline (except at high tide),  it
<b>Floyd</b> | just gradually vanishes under the sea, leaving tall rocks jutting up
<b>Floyd</b> | from the sea meters and meters from the shore. Father says that there
<b>Floyd</b> | are many shipwrecks close to the south tip because careless captains
<b>Floyd</b> | and sailors came too close to the shore. Often there's all kinds of
<b>Floyd</b> | flotsam floating between the rocks. Now there are only slimy and old
<b>Floyd</b> | sticks, leaves and algae mats, but sometimes you have found cans,
<b>Floyd</b> | bottles and once even plastic doll. In spite of the high winds,
<b>Floyd</b> | there's a stink of rotting seaweed and old fish.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | There's a rocket pilot fighting for his life amidst the waves that are
<b>Floyd</b> | pounding him against the rocks. The stubby gloves of his suit can't
<b>Floyd</b> | get a purchase on the slimy rocks, and he's trying to hang on to a
<b>Floyd</b> | small suitcase with one hand.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The hook hits the rocket man straight in the helmet visor, leaving a

<b>Floyd</b> | It takes you quite some time to reach the house, since the rocket man

<b>Floyd</b> | It takes a long time for the rocket man to climb up the stairs to the

<b>Floyd</b> | he almost falls down on the floor, and crawls to a corner next to a

<b>Floyd</b> | The attic is a cluttered, low space with a slanted roof. It's a scary
<b>Floyd</b> | place with dark nooks and crannies, piles of boxes and all kinds of
<b>Floyd</b> | weird junk. The only light is a lone bulb that has gone dim and yellow
<b>Floyd</b> | with age.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The rocket man is sitting up in the end of the attic, leaning against
<b>Floyd</b> | the wall. The rocket man has peeled off the top part of his suit and
<b>Floyd</b> | his shirt, revealing his upper body. He's really pale and also lean,
<b>Floyd</b> | like a gymnast.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Why do you need to go to Astro City one?" you ask the rocket man. "I
<b>Floyd</b> | told you, to deliver these documents."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Okay, that's it." the rocket man says and closes the suitcase with a
<b>Floyd</b> | snap. He gets up, grunting and pressing his hand against his side. You
<b>Floyd</b> | watch as he pulls on his undershirt, which is some kind of thermal
<b>Floyd</b> | space material, and zips up his space suit.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Getting out of the house is nerve wracking, especially in the attic
<b>Floyd</b> | stairs where the clumsy space suit makes all kinds of noise. Luckily
<b>Floyd</b> | your father's snoring covers it all up.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Not even Gogol launches into a barking attack when you go outside.

<b>Floyd</b> | sit on the concrete ledge to watch him go - and for a small eternity
<b>Floyd</b> | until his boat has vanished into the glitter of the moonlight on the
<b>Floyd</b> | sea, towards the brightly lit spires of Astro City One in the
<b>Floyd</b> | mainland.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Much later, when you are already shivering with cold and almost in
<b>Floyd</b> | tears because the feeling of loss, you start to make your way toward

</b><b>Floyd</b> | Even now, forty years later, you can remember that moment; the instant
<b>Floyd</b> | when you stopped being a child and ended up being an adult with a
<b>Floyd</b> | horrible burden to bear. When Astro City One went up, it started as a
<b>Floyd</b> | couple of bright flashes. The bangs reached you several seconds later,
<b>Floyd</b> | right before the blinding flash that sent pieces of fuel filled
<b>Floyd</b> | rockets and containers arcing through the sky in fiery fireballs. The
<b>Floyd</b> | blastwave of the explosion swept over the sea so fast it was almost
<b>Floyd</b> | too quick to see, and the bang almost struck the air out of your lungs
<b>Floyd</b> | and made your ears go beep.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You still remember the moment when you realized that Martians weren't
<b>Floyd</b> | tentacled monsters: they were human beings just like you and your
<b>Floyd</b> | parents. Humans, who just wanted to live free. That's what they got,
<b>Floyd</b> | thanks to one stupid kid. The loss of Astro City one was a huge blow
<b>Floyd</b> | to the Earth Alliance, and it turned the tide of the war. In three
<b>Floyd</b> | months there was a peace treaty, and Mars had seceded, leaving Earth
<b>Floyd</b> | with the burden of reparations for the long years of interplanetary
<b>Floyd</b> | war.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | All because of one stupid little kid, who wanted to become a rocket
<b>Floyd</b> | man.
