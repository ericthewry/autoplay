The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction. Below is a transcript of three IntroComp games, written by various authors.</br></br>

<I>The Waterhouse Women</I> was originally released as part of the 2002 IntroComp, where it took fourth place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/The_Waterhouse_Women'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br>

<I>Hey, Jingo!</I> was originally released as part of the 2002 IntroComp, where it took first place.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/Hey,_Jingo!'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.

<b>Floyd</b> | "John William Waterhouse: Fantasy and Realism"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | John William Waterhouse, born on April 6, 1849 to British parents in

<b>Floyd</b> | Rome, is considered to be one of the foremost artists of his era.
<b>Floyd</b> | Though truly a Classical artist, he is often regarded as
<b>Floyd</b> | Pre-Raphaelite due to his obvious affection for literature, myth,
<b>Floyd</b> | romanticism, and nature. Waterhouse's works are known for their use of
<b>Floyd</b> | colour, light, and intense attention to detail.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Waterhouse moved to England early in life and studied first in his
<b>Floyd</b> | father's studio, then later at the Royal Academy Schools. He became an
<b>Floyd</b> | Associate of the Royal Academy in 1885, and a Full Academician in
<b>Floyd</b> | 1895. His initial paintings depicted true life subjects, but he soon
<b>Floyd</b> | began to focus his work in more poetic realms, borrowing from the
<b>Floyd</b> | writings of Homer, Shakespeare, and Tennyson, among others.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Waterhouse continued painting up until the time of his death in 1917.

<b>Floyd</b> | When you try to take your hand away from the painting, you realise
<b>Floyd</b> | that you are powerless to do so. You begin to feel something, a

<b>Floyd</b> | ...and you feel yourself stepping into the painting.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Inside the painting entitled "The Crystal Ball"
<b>Floyd</b> | Glancing about, you notice that everything here is as it appeared in
<b>Floyd</b> | the painting. To the north is the elegant woman standing between the

<b>Floyd</b> | table and chair, and beyond her the window, but your new point of view
<b>Floyd</b> | from inside the painting allows you to see the rest of the room as
<b>Floyd</b> | well. A second window is set in the eastern wall, and a matching chair
<b>Floyd</b> | can be seen opposite the table from its mate. A large trunk sits in
<b>Floyd</b> | the northwest corner of the room, and a looking-glass can be seen to
<b>Floyd</b> | the southeast. Behind you, to the south, is a door.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Slowly, the woman opens her eyes and lifts her gaze to meet your own.
<b>Floyd</b> | A knowing smile plays across her lips. "I've been watching you," she
<b>Floyd</b> | says softly. "You think yourself off course, lost from the world you
<b>Floyd</b> | know and understand." She pauses, looks into the crystal, and begins
<b>Floyd</b> | to speak again. "I see a path for you, Wanderer. Its course is not yet

<b>Floyd</b> | determined, but its ending is clear. You will find that which you
<b>Floyd</b> | seek."  She lifts her eyes again, her fingers still playing delicately
<b>Floyd</b> | across the surface of the orb. "I am Sophronia, daughter of Aisling,
<b>Floyd</b> | and I knew you would find me."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She looks at you expectantly.

<b>Floyd</b> | "John William Waterhouse: Fantasy and Realism"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | John William Waterhouse, born on April 6, 1849 to British parents in
<b>Floyd</b> | Rome, is considered to be one of the foremost artists of his era.
<b>Floyd</b> | Though truly a Classical artist, he is often regarded as
<b>Floyd</b> | Pre-Raphaelite due to his obvious affection for literature, myth,

<b>Floyd</b> | romanticism, and nature. Waterhouse's works are known for their use of
<b>Floyd</b> | colour, light, and intense attention to detail.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Waterhouse moved to England early in life and studied first in his
<b>Floyd</b> | father's studio, then later at the Royal Academy Schools. He became an
<b>Floyd</b> | Associate of the Royal Academy in 1885, and a Full Academician in

<b>Floyd</b> | 1895. His initial paintings depicted true life subjects, but he soon
<b>Floyd</b> | began to focus his work in more poetic realms, borrowing from the
<b>Floyd</b> | writings of Homer, Shakespeare, and Tennyson, among others.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Waterhouse continued painting up until the time of his death in 1917.

<b>Floyd</b> | research and knowledge, is accurate. I have been asked whether I will
<b>Floyd</b> | rework "The Waterhouse Women" in a different platform so as to include
<b>Floyd</b> | images of the paintings, but I have no plans to do anything like that
<b>Floyd</b> | at this time. Images of the paintings themselves are still under

<b>Floyd</b> | copyright, and are therefore not included in this game. However, a
<b>Floyd</b> | simple search on the Internet will yield a wealth of results about
<b>Floyd</b> | Waterhouse, and multiple images of each painting exist on a number of
<b>Floyd</b> | different websites.

<b>Floyd</b> | This is a very short version of the game, intended to be an

<b>Floyd</b> | "The Waterhouse Women" was created for IntroComp 2002, a deceptively
<b>Floyd</b> | simple competition where introductory games are judged on one criteria
<b>Floyd</b> | only: "How much do you want to play more of this entry?"

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | On the west wall is a painting of a mermaid, set in a gold and grey

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | On the north wall is an intricately detailed oil painting of a woman,

<b>Floyd</b> | Glancing about, you notice that everything here is as it appeared in

<b>Floyd</b> | the painting allows you to see the rest of the room as well: a second

<b>Floyd</b> | opposite the table from its mate. A large trunk sits in the northwest

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Minister Helzog's office lies through an open glass door to the north,
<b>Floyd</b> | and the street lies to the west. An inconspicuous back door leads east

<b>Floyd</b> | Frodo looks hurt. "Now, now, I paid you back --"
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Frodo continues, "I'm past all that, although every once in a while I
<b>Floyd</b> | might *glance* and see how certain ponies are doing. Well, Mr. Jarvis
<b>Floyd</b> | had heard about my little addiction and of course I explained how I
<b>Floyd</b> | was much more mature now--"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (Snicker.)

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "--and he ranted about how he was making sure his daughter was
<b>Floyd</b> | marrying someone decent and if he so much as sniffed trouble the
<b>Floyd</b> | wedding would be off. Izzy's not the eloping type, she insists it has
<b>Floyd</b> | to be a wedding. So, here comes the problem..."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "...yesterday when I was over I used the computer in the den to browse

<b>Floyd</b> | [1] So basically, you're saying you left evidence of your very-rare

<b>Floyd</b> | You twinge slightly at saying the word. It goes against the Code,

<b>Floyd</b> | you very well:

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Frodo says, "Good, good. Now, of course it would be easy if I could

<b>Floyd</b> | Oversized Gazebo
<b>Floyd</b> | The Jarvises have invested as much in lighting as in architectural
<b>Floyd</b> | nuance, for there is nary a nook or cranny in this gazebo -- or the

<b>Floyd</b> | entire grounds -- that is unlit. You can't make out much roof detail
<b>Floyd</b> | through all the glare, compounded by a jostling from one of the pairs
<b>Floyd</b> | of dancers skittering across the floor to the accompaniment of new-age
<b>Floyd</b> | polka. The support pillars look nice, though, they've got a twirling
<b>Floyd</b> | spiral pattern to them and you run your eyes back and forth over the
<b>Floyd</b> | edges to pass the time. Going east will get you back to the garden.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Where is that old reprobate Frodo anyway?
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On cue, you feel a poke at your back as he whispers in your ear "Big

<b>Floyd</b> | was over but my wonderfully paranoid in-law has picked a new hiding

<b>Floyd</b> | spot. It used to be on the bottom of the cookie tin. You'll have to
