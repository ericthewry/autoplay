The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>The Cove</i>, written by Kathleen&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Fischer.  <i>The Cove</i> was originally released as part of the 2000 IF Art Show, where it took Best of Landscape. You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/The_Cove"><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br>

</br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.

<b>Floyd</b> | Rocky Point
<b>Floyd</b> | High above the surf, Rocky Point offers a sweeping view of the western

<b>Floyd</b> | sea. From this lofty vantage point, looking south across a narrow
<b>Floyd</b> | strip of sand, you can clearly see the fractured granite cliffs that

<b>Floyd</b> | dotted with offshore rocks and barren beaches, swept clear of sand by

<b>Floyd</b> | winter storms.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Turning toward the sea, you take a moment to soak up the last few rays

<b>Floyd</b> | Surrounded by cliffs on three sides, this narrow strip of sand curves

<b>Floyd</b> | from north to south and faces a small cove to the west. With the tide
<b>Floyd</b> | half in, the marine terrace to the southwest is beginning to take on
<b>Floyd</b> | water. To the north, the sea has dug a narrow, twisting tunnel through
<b>Floyd</b> | the headland.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Long ribbons of seaweed strewn across the shore mark the leading edge

<b>Floyd</b> | of the surf at about half way up the beach. Additional clumps, dried
<b>Floyd</b> | and full of sand, lie tangled amongst the rocks at the base of the
<b>Floyd</b> | cliffs; a warning of the sea's intentions.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The clouds close ranks overhead, blotting out the sun completely and
<b>Floyd</b> | turning the sea from blue to gray. Outside the cove the wind is

<b>Floyd</b> | beginning to kick up whitecaps and push the swells up even further up
<b>Floyd</b> | the shore.

<b>Floyd</b> | sea tunnel burrows through the headland about half the way up the
<b>Floyd</b> | beach. It is unreachable when the tide is high, both to those wanting

<b>Floyd</b> | in... and out. And in your childhood dreams you often found yourself

<b>Floyd</b> | trapped inside as the waves grew ever higher, your screams for help
<b>Floyd</b> | being carried out to sea. Moments later the water would come rushing
<b>Floyd</b> | through the tunnel and do the same to you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You  glance up at the clouds. Though it's pouring rain now, it seems

<b>Floyd</b> | the clouds are thinning to the west. Perhaps this will all blow over

<b>Floyd</b> | soon, but until it does there is nowhere else dry to go. So summoning
<b>Floyd</b> | your courage, you dash between the waves, scramble up the rocks, and
<b>Floyd</b> | enter the tunnel.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Tunnel's Entrance

<b>Floyd</b> | The narrow opening of the sea tunnel looks southward across the beach

<b>Floyd</b> | and to the granite cliffs beyond. From here, by craning your head
<b>Floyd</b> | around the rocks to the east, you are just able to make out the tips
<b>Floyd</b> | of the cypress trees, looking like ghostly shadows as the clouds pass
<b>Floyd</b> | by.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Waves rolling in from the west tumble over the rocks below, sending up

<b>Floyd</b> | a heavy shower of spray and then move on.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After a few moments it becomes clear that this spot offers little in
<b>Floyd</b> | the way of protection from the driving rain, and the cold sea spray is
<b>Floyd</b> | actually making things worse. As fears of the past are swept away by

<b>Floyd</b> | the realities of the present, you make your way further into the

<b>Floyd</b> | tunnel, squeezing past its narrowest point, then hurrying on to the
<b>Floyd</b> | northern end.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Tunnel's End
<b>Floyd</b> | The tunnel ends abruptly here, its rocky floor falling sharply away to

<b>Floyd</b> | the pounding sea. Wide gaps in the stones above allow in just enough

<b>Floyd</b> | light to clearly see the masses of barnacles clustered around fissures
<b>Floyd</b> | in the stones and the slippery green algae on the tunnel floor that
<b>Floyd</b> | makes the footing treacherous.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | from north to south and faces a small cove to the west. With the tide
<b>Floyd</b> | half in, the marine terrace to the southwest is beginning to take on
<b>Floyd</b> | water. To the north, the sea has dug a narrow, twisting tunnel through
<b>Floyd</b> | the headland.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Long ribbons of seaweed strewn across the shore mark the leading edge


<b>Floyd</b> | of the surf at about half way up the beach. Additional clumps, dried
<b>Floyd</b> | and full of sand, lie tangled amongst the rocks at the base of the
<b>Floyd</b> | cliffs; a warning of the sea's intentions.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You pass your hands over your face to clear the rain away.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | You eye the still dry tunnel nervously. Carved by wind and waves, the
<b>Floyd</b> | sea tunnel burrows through the headland about half the way up the
<b>Floyd</b> | beach. It is unreachable when the tide is high, both to those wanting
<b>Floyd</b> | in... and out. And in your childhood dreams you often found yourself


<b>Floyd</b> | trapped inside as the waves grew ever higher, your screams for help
<b>Floyd</b> | being carried out to sea. Moments later the water would come rushing
<b>Floyd</b> | through the tunnel and do the same to you.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You  glance up at the clouds. Though it's pouring rain now, it seems
<b>Floyd</b> | the clouds are thinning to the west. Perhaps this will all blow over


<b>Floyd</b> | soon, but until it does there is nowhere else dry to go. So summoning
<b>Floyd</b> | your courage, you dash between the waves, scramble up the rocks, and
<b>Floyd</b> | enter the tunnel.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Tunnel's Entrance
<b>Floyd</b> | The narrow opening of the sea tunnel looks southward across the beach


<b>Floyd</b> | and to the granite cliffs beyond. From here, by craning your head
<b>Floyd</b> | around the rocks to the east, you are just able to make out the tips
<b>Floyd</b> | of the cypress trees, looking like ghostly shadows as the clouds pass
<b>Floyd</b> | by.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Waves rolling in from the west tumble over the rocks below, sending up


<b>Floyd</b> | a heavy shower of spray and then move on.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After a few moments it becomes clear that this spot offers little in
<b>Floyd</b> | the way of protection from the driving rain, and the cold sea spray is
<b>Floyd</b> | actually making things worse. As fears of the past are swept away by
<b>Floyd</b> | the realities of the present, you make your way further into the


<b>Floyd</b> | tunnel, squeezing past its narrowest point, then hurrying on to the
<b>Floyd</b> | northern end.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Tunnel's End
<b>Floyd</b> | The tunnel ends abruptly here, its rocky floor falling sharply away to
<b>Floyd</b> | the pounding sea. Wide gaps in the stones above allow in just enough


<b>Floyd</b> | light to clearly see the masses of barnacles clustered around fissures
<b>Floyd</b> | in the stones and the slippery green algae on the tunnel floor that
<b>Floyd</b> | makes the footing treacherous.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Near the opening, half covered in algae, is a flattened stone standing
<b>Floyd</b> | somewhat apart from the rest.

<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | This game was written as a Landscape/Scenery entry for the Interactive
<b>Floyd</b> | Fiction Art Show. Almost all nouns in the text should be fair game for
<b>Floyd</b> | examining, with the other senses (listen, touch, taste, smell)
<b>Floyd</b> | supplied when I thought it was appropriate. Although the number of


<b>Floyd</b> | takeable objects has been kept to a minimum as per the rules of the
<b>Floyd</b> | show, there are a few so feel free to try it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Note: Players might find it useful to REMEMBER from time to time,
<b>Floyd</b> | especially at changes in scenery or situation.
<b>Floyd</b> |


<b>Floyd</b> | Though I set out to make it plotless, I quickly realized I couldn't
<b>Floyd</b> | write that way. We all approach a scene with our own set of memories,
<b>Floyd</b> | likes, dislikes, etc., and the PC (player character - you) is no
<b>Floyd</b> | different. As soon as I created a particular PC to be viewing these
<b>Floyd</b> | things, a plot crept in, and with a plot came a puzzle or two. They
<b>Floyd</b> | aren't meant to be confusing, and I hope you don't find them to be so.


<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | I want to acknowledge all those who have given help to me in the past;
<b>Floyd</b> | Andrew Plotkin, Gareth Rees, Marnie Parker, Magnus Olsen, Adam Cadre
<b>Floyd</b> | (for flags.h), Graham Nelson (for Inform, the language this is written
<b>Floyd</b> | in)... I wish I had kept better records so I could list you all. And
<b>Floyd</b> | to my husband, who gracefully accepted being a computer widower most


<b>Floyd</b> | of the time, and wisely dragged me away from the keyboard the rest of
<b>Floyd</b> | the time.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A very special thank you to Irene Callaci, who, for the past year and
<b>Floyd</b> | half has been the reason I have kept writing every day, both recently
<b>Floyd</b> | on this little game, and on my REAL game (still in progress). Her


<b>Floyd</b> | daily question of: "So, what did you do last night?" and her limitless
<b>Floyd</b> | patience analyzing the answer, has kept me going though dreadful bugs
<b>Floyd</b> | and writers block, bad plots and worse writing. She has been as free
<b>Floyd</b> | with her wonderful ideas as with her code, and she is entirely to
<b>Floyd</b> | blame for the fact that I finally finished a game.
<b>Floyd</b> |


<b>Floyd</b> | Along with Irene, Jim Aikin and David Glasser and David Myers agreed
<b>Floyd</b> | to subject themselves to a beta version of this game, and all
<b>Floyd</b> | dutifully (gleefully?) reported my grammatical blunders, persistant
<b>Floyd</b> | failure to correctly use Mr. Apostrophe, repetitious code, plot holes,
<b>Floyd</b> | RAM errors (Read-Authors-Mind) and the like. Many thanks!
<b>Floyd</b> |


<b>Floyd</b> | Finally, I should note that as this is my first (released) game, I
<b>Floyd</b> | would dearly love to hear any thoughts/questions/opinions/suggestions
<b>Floyd</b> | you might have. I can be reached at mfischer5@aol.com or you can post
<b>Floyd</b> | to rec.arts.int-fiction or rec.games.int-fiction (the former for
<b>Floyd</b> | programming issues, the later for game play).
