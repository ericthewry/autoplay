The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>
Below is a transcript of <i>Scavenger</i>, written by Quintin Stone.  <I>Scavenger</I> was originally released as part of the 2003 Interactive Fiction Competition, where it took third place. It went on to be nominated for three Xyzzy Awards, including Best Game, Best Puzzles, and Best Individual NPC.  You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF='http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Scavenger'><u>the ifWiki</u></A>.</br></br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing this game, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played this game, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> | Unbelievable.  This could very well be it.  The big score.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Every scavenger dreams of that one discovery that will grant riches

<b>Floyd</b> | Howe Street, Arcadia
<b>Floyd</b> | The few street lights that still work on this run down section of road
<b>Floyd</b> | do little to dispel the everpresent gloom of the city.  Even in the
<b>Floyd</b> | middle of the day the sun is barely more than a faint glow in the thick
<b>Floyd</b> | clouds above.  The street itself is ancient crumbling asphalt; they
<b>Floyd</b> | simply don't maintain the roads this far from the city core.  This one
<b>Floyd</b> | heads north, back towards your meager home, and south, out of the city.
<b>Floyd</b> | A cross street leads east towards CyTek Corporation's main compound,
<b>Floyd</b> | and a small merchant shop you know well sits among derelict buildings
<b>Floyd</b> | to the west.

<b>Floyd</b> | Another special feature that the game supports on many computer systems
<b>Floyd</b> | is called "review mode."  The game remembers text as it "scrolls" off
<b>Floyd</b> | the screen; by invoking recall mode, you can go back and look at text
<b>Floyd</b> | that is no longer visible on the screen.  On most systems, review mode
<b>Floyd</b> | is activated by pressing the PAGE UP key.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Once in review mode, the status line that is normally at the top of the
<b>Floyd</b> | screen will be replaced by the review mode help line.  This line shows
<b>Floyd</b> | the keystrokes you use to view previous screenfuls of text, and also
<b>Floyd</b> | shows you the key that exits review mode and resumes normal game play
<b>Floyd</b> | (this is generally the game key that you used to activate review mode).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | While in review mode, your screen becomes a window onto the text that
<b>Floyd</b> | the game has stored away.  When you first activate review mode, you are
<b>Floyd</b> | looking at the very bottom of this text, which is the screenful of text
<b>Floyd</b> | that was just displayed.  Use the up and down cursor-arrow keys to move
<b>Floyd</b> | the window up and down.  Pressing the up cursor-arrow key moves the
<b>Floyd</b> | window up one line, showing you one line of text that has scrolled off
<b>Floyd</b> | the screen.  Most systems also provide keys to move up and down by a
<b>Floyd</b> | full screenful (also called a "page.")
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | To resume game play, press the same key that you used to activate
<b>Floyd</b> | review mode.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The number of screenfuls of text that the game stores away for review
<b>Floyd</b> | depends on how much text is actually on each screen, since the game has
<b>Floyd</b> | a limit on the number of characters it can store, not on the number of
<b>Floyd</b> | lines.  Normally, more than twenty of the most recent screens of text
<b>Floyd</b> | are saved and available for review at any given time.

<b>Floyd</b> | The game understands several special commands that you can use to
<b>Floyd</b> | control the game.  You can use these commands at any prompt.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    About the game
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | ABOUT:  Displays whatever information the author thought necessary to
<b>Floyd</b> | give about the game, such as its history, influences, what the author
<b>Floyd</b> | was wearing when he/she wrote it, etc.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | CREDITS:  Show a list of the people that developed this game.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | HELP:  You're looking at it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | HINT:  Some games will include an automated hint system to help guide
<b>Floyd</b> | you through the trickier parts.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | VERSION:  Shows you the current version of the game.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Command related
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | AGAIN or G:  Repeats your last command.  If your last input line was
<b>Floyd</b> | composed of several commands, only the last command on the line is
<b>Floyd</b> | repeated.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | OOPS:  Allows you to correct the spelling of a word in the last
<b>Floyd</b> | command.  You can use OOPS when the game displays this complaint:  "I
<b>Floyd</b> | don't know the word &lt;word&gt;."  Immediately after this message, you can
<b>Floyd</b> | type OOPS followed by the corrected spelling of the misspelled word.
<b>Floyd</b> | You can only type one word after OOPS, so this command doesn't allow
<b>Floyd</b> | you to correct certain types of errors, such as when you run two words
<b>Floyd</b> | together without a space.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | UNDO:  Take back the last command.  This can be used multiple times to
<b>Floyd</b> | take back a series of commands in sequence.  The number of commands
<b>Floyd</b> | that you can undo at any given time varies, but you can generally undo
<b>Floyd</b> | over a hundred commands.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | WAIT or Z:  Causes game time to pass.  When the game is waiting for you
<b>Floyd</b> | to type command, no game time passes; you can use this command to wait
<b>Floyd</b> | for something to happen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    In-game information
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | DIAGNOSE:  Displays information about your player character's health.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | INVENTORY or I:  Shows the list of items your player character is
<b>Floyd</b> | carrying.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | LOOK or L:  Shows the full description of your location.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | TERSE:  Tells the game to only show the full description of a location
<b>Floyd</b> | the first time you enter it.  Later visits to that room will only
<b>Floyd</b> | display the short description.  Of course, you can get a full
<b>Floyd</b> | description at any time by typing LOOK.  This is the default mode for
<b>Floyd</b> | most games.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | VERBOSE:  Tells the game to show you the full description of a location
<b>Floyd</b> | every time you enter it, whether or not you have seen the description
<b>Floyd</b> | before.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Score related
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | SCORE:  Shows you your current score, the maximum possible score, and
<b>Floyd</b> | the number of turns you have taken so far.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | FULL:  Lists all of the points you've earned so far and how you earned
<b>Floyd</b> | them.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | NOTIFY:  Tells the game whether you want to be notified of score
<b>Floyd</b> | changes when they happen.  When the game starts, NOTIFY is turned on,
<b>Floyd</b> | so you will see a message whenever you do something that changes your
<b>Floyd</b> | score.  If you'd prefer not to see these messages, type NOTIFY.  (If
<b>Floyd</b> | you later change your mind, typing NOTIFY again will turn notification
<b>Floyd</b> | back on.)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |    Game state control
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | QUIT:  Stops the game, and returns you to your operating system.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | RESTART:  Starts the game over from the beginning.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | RESTORE:  Restores a position previously saved with the SAVE command.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | SAVE:  Stores the current state of the game in a disk file, so that you
<b>Floyd</b> | can come back to the same place later (with the RESTORE command).
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | SCRIPT:  Starts writing everything you see on the screen (your commands
<b>Floyd</b> | and the game's responses) to a disk file.  The game will ask you for a
<b>Floyd</b> | filename to be used for the transcript; you should select a filename
<b>Floyd</b> | that does not yet exist on your disk, because if you use an existing
<b>Floyd</b> | filename, data in the file will be destroyed.  Use the UNSCRIPT command
<b>Floyd</b> | to stop making the transcript.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | UNSCRIPT:  Turns off the transcript being made with the SCRIPT command.

<b>Floyd</b> | The opening is square, with a series of cement steps leading down to

<b>Floyd</b> | extends for several feet around the entryway in a wide rectangle.  On

<b>Floyd</b> | door.  The road from the west curves north here, leading to the rest of
<b>Floyd</b> | the village.  While the town looks deserted, there is sign of recent

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Among the clods of dirt, you see a pair of coyote corpses.

<b>Floyd</b> | It appears that there's been an explosion in this area.  There's a

<b>Floyd</b> | 2060-08-25     Corporal Jacob
<b>Floyd</b> |    A civilian penetrated the base perimeter before being spotted by a
<b>Floyd</b> | passing tech and reported to security.  Colonel Miles has had
<b>Floyd</b> | Lieutenant Leach reassigned for this failure in security.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 2060-09-20     Sergeant Herbert
<b>Floyd</b> |    A company of renegade troops passing nearby caught sight of the base
<b>Floyd</b> | perimeter and advanced on the base.  The 83rd Armored engaged them and
<b>Floyd</b> | drove them back, but took heavy casualties.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 2060-10-11     Sergeant Herbert
<b>Floyd</b> |    Official word's come in that another base in NM has fallen to the
<b>Floyd</b> | rebels.  Rumors have it that their base commander went over to the
<b>Floyd</b> | other side.  The Colonel has ordered now that speech even somewhat
<b>Floyd</b> | sympathetic to the rebel cause is grounds for court martial and
<b>Floyd</b> | immediate execution for treason.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 2060-10-20     Major Tuco
<b>Floyd</b> |    The owrd just came ocver the radio.  Edgar gave THE ORDER.  oh god I
<b>Floyd</b> | camn't bleieve this oh god oh god oh god
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | 2060-12-09     Captain Ramirez
<b>Floyd</b> |    We're out of food and supplies.  Major Tuco has vanished.  Colonel
<b>Floyd</b> | Miles is dead.  Private Robinson went crazy when the Colonel refused to
<b>Floyd</b> | discuss the idea of leaving the base.  Shot him right in front of
<b>Floyd</b> | everyone.  The others killed her right after she did it.  Now we have
<b>Floyd</b> | no choice.  We hve to leave and see if there's anything left.  Can
<b>Floyd</b> | there be?  Can there be anything left?  Anyone alive?  The radio's been
<b>Floyd</b> | dead since it all happened.  We will be too if we don't leave soon.

<b>Floyd</b> | As I stated in my readme file, Scavenger grew out of an idea for a
<b>Floyd</b> | short story I had.  The game itself was not meant to be particularly
<b>Floyd</b> | focused on any one particular style, but a mix of puzzles, exploration,
<b>Floyd</b> | and atmosphere.  I began working on the game in September of 2002 while
<b>Floyd</b> | waiting for the release of the 2002 IF Competition games.  Most of the
<b>Floyd</b> | code was finished by November, and the next several months were spent
<b>Floyd</b> | polishing and reacting to the input from testers.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The Infocom game that probably made the biggest impression on me in my
<b>Floyd</b> | youth was Planetfall, which probably comes as no surprise now that
<b>Floyd</b> | you've played Scavenger.  There are likely more parallels than even I
<b>Floyd</b> | realize.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As I play through various "modern" IF from the past 10 years, I'm
<b>Floyd</b> | learning how some ideas repeat themselves.  While playing the well-made
<b>Floyd</b> | game "Babel", I was rather sadly surprised to find a
<b>Floyd</b> | block-door-with-pole puzzle nearly identical to my own, and at a point
<b>Floyd</b> | where my game was effectively finished.  Not relishing the thought of
<b>Floyd</b> | rewriting of one of the few major puzzles, I decided to simply leave it
<b>Floyd</b> | (and the Babel-ish corroded door hinges) in and throw myself on the
<b>Floyd</b> | mercy of the court.  Great minds think alike and all that, right?
<b>Floyd</b> | Ironically, I then found a review of "Babel" that criticized it for
<b>Floyd</b> | duplicating a central idea found in the game "Delusions".  I guess it's
<b>Floyd</b> | just the nature of the beast.  There are so many amateur works of
<b>Floyd</b> | interactive fiction now floating around the internet that no author can
<b>Floyd</b> | be expected to have played them all.  I'm sure as I play though the
<b>Floyd</b> | archive of games I'll come across one that's pretty much identical to
<b>Floyd</b> | the idea for my next game, forcing me to smash my computer with a
<b>Floyd</b> | crowbar.  Ah well.

<b>Floyd</b> | Charlie's Shop
<b>Floyd</b> | It's not the selection that keeps bringing you back.  It's just the
<b>Floyd</b> | convenient location.  Plus you and Charlie have known each other for a
<b>Floyd</b> | few years now so he gives you a bit of a discount.  He can usually be
<b>Floyd</b> | counted on to have what you need.  The store itself is fairly small,
<b>Floyd</b> | just a single room.  Charlie leans against a glass countertop that
<b>Floyd</b> | doubles as a display case, flipping through one of the Arcadia
<b>Floyd</b> | newspapers with a bored expression on his face.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The display case contains a laser gun.
