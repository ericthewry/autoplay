						The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each
						week at a pre-arranged time, a group of
						people meet online to cooperatively play
						a game of interactive fiction.

						<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of <I>Hollywood Visionary</I>.
						It is a a commercial release by Choice Of Games, released in 2015. As of the date of this transcript, the game has been nominated for two Xyzzy Awards (Best Game and Best NPCs).

						You can learn more about the game, including how to purchase it, by visiting




								<a class="decorate" href='http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=tpyd3aa3isbzx9gu'>IFDB</a>.

								<br/><br/><B>Special Note:</B> For this particular game, rather than using Floyd (the bot we usually use to facilitate game play), text was cut & pasted directly from the game into ifMUD. This necessitated editing by hand that would not normally occur in the transcript; there may be slight ommissions or oddities of formatting as a consequence of this. If you see any such inconsistencies, they are likely the result of this and not the fault of Aaron A. Reed or Choice Of Games.
								
								<br/><br/><B>Interesting Note:</B> For the curious, the transcript below contains 185 choices made and reveals only about 20% of the game's overall available content.

					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing this game, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played this game, and think you might like to at some
						point, I do not recommend reading any further. Instead,
						you might want to return to the <a class="decorate" href=

			<tr><td class="room game"><pre>The elevator opens onto your future.
<BR/>You step onto the dangerous red carpet of Lloyd Croghan. Yes, the Lloyd Croghan, who started as a shoeshine boy and built a Hollywood empire from timbers up. Ten years you've worked at this studio and you've only met him twice. And now you've got sixty seconds to pitch him your dream project: the movie you've always wanted to make.
<BR/>The elevator boy tips his cap nervously, slams the gate shut, and beats a quick retreat down to safer floors.
<BR/>You approach Croghan's imposing mahogany desk with care. The man himself sits behind it, tall as a linebacker but whisper-thin, a face all angles and edges balanced above a charcoal-grey bow tie, immaculately tied. He smokes a Diego cigar with one wiry hand while riffling through the box office reports with the other.
<BR/>He hasn't looked up. How to get his attention?
<BR/><B>CHOICES:</B>
- Wait for him to notice me.
- Cough politely.
- Announce myself.
</pre></td><td class="gutter"></td>

</td></tr><tr><td class="room game"><pre><B>CHOICE MADE: </B>ANNOUNCE MYSELF
<BR/>"I'm here about the pitch, Mr. Croghan," you say in a strong, clear voice.
<BR/>He looks up with a creased brow, annoyed perhaps at this interruption. "Yes, the pitch," he says with distaste, waving vaguely at a little chair facing his desk. "Sit, and let's get through with it."
<BR/>Since he didn't mention your name, you assume he's forgotten it. Not a great start.
<BR/>You slip into the chair, trying to stay calm. You've got one chance at this, one chance to impress Croghan enough to give you a greenlight. It all comes down to this.
<BR/>"All right, what have you got for me?" he asks, looking bored.

<BR/>"...and racy. Make the screen sizzle."
<BR/>The mogul's eyebrows twitch as his rough-hewn face slips into a familiar frown. "A racy musical science fiction picture," he says slowly. He leans back, with a small smile even more dangerous than the frown, and waggles the Diego cigar at you. "Go on, then. Let's get this over with."
<BR/>Sweat poises delicately at your hairline; you keep it from falling by sheer will. A glance at the clock: forty seconds left. There's got to be an angle that'll grab him. Maybe the setting?
<BR/>"The story takes place..."

- on a future Earth.
- on board a spaceship traveling between the stars.
- in the exotic streets of Morocco.
- at a top-secret underground nuclear lab.

<BR/>Yes, yes it was.
<BR/>Only a handful of years ago, the idea of someone like you starting her own movie studio would have been laughable. But everything changed in 1948, when the Supreme Court ruled against the Hollywood monopoly, where studios owned the theater chains and only showed their own pictures. Now anyone's got a shot at national distribution. For every lumbering giant like Paramount and Warner, there are a half-dozen upstart studios flush with talent and hungry energy. It's the rise of the independents.
<BR/>You've spent twelve months planning, recruiting, financing, glad-handing, cajoling, bargaining, and yes, pitching. Pitching your dream flick to actors, investors, riggers, even janitors. Pitching your vision of a studio willing to be bold, to take risks and put everything on the line to make something magic.
<BR/>And one by one, you've gathered believers. People who remember your hard work, who've seen your talent. People who want to make something great. Together you've pulled this studio together, brick by brick and light by light.

<BR/>Eugene has you sign a half-dozen other forms in quick succession, then jerks his head for you to follow him over to B Stage.
<BR/>The lot is chaos, held just under the boiling point of panic. Painters are still putting finishing touches on the small row of offices between the two shooting stages. A gardener's pickup laden with saplings is parked atop an unfinished path, and the gardener and bricklayer are using men's words with each other. Frantic boys chase after tumbling paperwork caught in hot gusts of air.
<BR/>You can't help but smile, though. The whirling mayhem is finally accreting into something recognizably studio, like a slow-motion shot of shattering glass threaded in reverse. Soon movie magic will be made here. You feel it in your bones.

<BR/>He takes you over to B Stage to find the foreman.
<BR/><B>NEXT PAGE...</B>
<BR/>An aging warehouse with enough room for a couple of mid-sized sets, B Stage already had a storied Hollywood past when you took it over. You were able to reuse most of the existing overhead rigging, the doors were already large enough to get equipment and set pieces in and out, and the place was wired for electricity (though less up to code than you'd originally hoped).
<BR/>Eugene guides you over to the foreman, himself center of a small storm of assistants and clipboards, and you quickly get the paperwork taken care of. You're just wondering if you can find a shady spot to sit down for a moment when a runner taps you on the shoulder.
<BR/>"Chief! You've got a visitor over by C Stage. She says it's top priority."

<BR/>You blink in the hot sun as you walk the few paces to C Stage, your secondary shooting space. (The absent A Stage burnt to the ground sometime before the war, or so you were told.)
<BR/>Standing in the shadow of the soundstage, you see a kid (a kid? Who let some kid onto your lot?) and a woman who's as out of place amid the bustle of workers as a French poodle in a wolf pack: draped in a stylish fur that must be stifling in this heat and wearing a ridiculous swooping hat, she looks like a lost movie star until you get close enough to recognize the face. Well, well: wonders never cease. It's your long-lost sister, Romana.
<BR/>It's been... God, at least ten years since you spoke: the last time did not end well. Romana's desperate longing for a life of luxury coupled with her tendency to make impulsive, hotheaded decisions was not a happy combination. She'd had three spouses and three divorces by age twenty-two. (You still haven't managed even one of either.) When she betrothed a wealthy aristocrat from a tiny European country, your sensible objections that he seemed to enjoy flirting with other women nearly as much as spoiling her with lavish presents were ignored. She flew off to live in a castle and letters were not forthcoming.
<BR/><B>NEXT PAGE...</B>
<BR/>Of course, Romana was never nice to you to begin with. Being civil is going to raise your blood pressure, you can tell: getting in some good digs, on the other hand, might feel awfully nice.
<BR/>She spots you a moment later from behind fashionably oversized sunglasses and nods cooly. "Little sister... Glad to see you're doing well."

<BR/>"The papers?" you say. "Have you moved back to California, then?"
<BR/>"Yes, we've got a little place up on Mulholland now," she says airily, opening a fan and wafting at the summer air with ineffectual flaps.

Since she's your only sibling, and you have no children of your own, this sudden clench of familial recognition in a youngster's face is an unfamiliar sensation.
<BR/>You kneel down to get a better look at your new relation. She looks about ten, hair cut short, with your grandmother's eyes and pointed nose. She's gazing around the studio lot with unbridled fascination, scratching and wriggling uncomfortably in a pink dress she obviously wishes she were out of.

<BR/><B>NEXT PAGE...</B>
<BR>You've known Fish Grundy for years, ever since you helped get him a part in a B-picture that ended up being the most memorable scene in the film. An amazing comedian and true star, Fish grew up on the vaudeville circuit, then had a stint of popularity in the silent era playing a loveable, troublemaking slave, outfoxing wealthy, bumbling plantation owners who ended up face-first in a swamp or a pudding, while he tripped and grinned his way north. He managed to survive the transition to sound, and while he's never quite secured the fame he deserves, he keeps working, year in and year out.
<BR>Nowadays he's somewhere in the pantheon of minor Hollywood royalty. Though respected for his years of experience and endless font of golden-age stories, his penchant for practical jokes (and perhaps the color of his skin) sometimes make him persona non grata at fancy parties. He crashes them anyway.
<BR>When he'd offered to take you to lunch to help plan out your script, you jumped at the chance: not only for the professional advice, but because he's a damn funny sonofabitch.

<BR>There's a palpable sense of excitement in the air. On the one hand, this is just a screen test: a first pass from the costumers, makeup, lighting and camera crews to figure out how to make your stars look their best on screen. But it's also the first time cameras are rolling on your lot, the first time the talent's stepping onto a soundstage. You push past a rack full of racy costumes and some special effects crew doing a test shot with a matte painting, and can't help but feel it's starting to seem like an honest-to-God movie studio around here.
<BR>C Stage is smaller, but still spacious enough for a couple sets, a ton of rigging, and the editing bay and storage closets down near the back. The stage is packed to capacity today with people and gear.
<BR>A grip taps you on the shoulder. "The talent's here for the screen test, chief," he says. You and the others follow him to a bank of lights and cameras set up against a white background.

<BR/>You feel a twinge of guilt at that. You know your sister: you can imagine what kind of mother she'd be. Maybe it's no wonder Ada's willing to hide in a crate all day to get out of the house.
<BR/>You kneel down. "Look, Ada," you say. "You can't sulk about my film set unsupervised. It's a safety hazard. But..." She looks up, hopeful. "If you clear it with Eugene, you can come visit every now and then. But he's going to be responsible for you, and I need him, so you'd better find a way to be a help and not a hindrance."
<BR/>"I'll be so helpful!" she says, eyes lighting up. "I can make coffee or run errands or hold things or..." She bites her lip, then kisses your cheek. "Thanks, Aunt Flowers."

<BR/>LLOYD CROGHAN BEGINS PRODUCTION ON NEW MUSICAL SCIENCE FICTION PICTURE
<BR/>You put the paper down, shaking your head. That bastard's trying to scoop you.

<BR/><BR/>Studio McStudioface
--------------------------
Project: Outcast Odyssey
Producer: Flowers Floyd
Status: production
Your ledger is in the black: on budget
Crew Stress: 49%
Screenplay:
Original: 40% Familiar: 60%
Intellectual: 85% Accessible: 15%
Intense: 70% Relaxing: 30%
Quality: 60%
Production:
Acting: 56%
Directing: 40%
Craft: 40%
<BR/>Now that you're entering production, you'll be tracking not only the caliber of the directing and acting, but also the craft of your behind-the-scenes technicians: the lighting, the sound, the sets and costumes. This depends mostly on your crew's stress and how you handle it. Quality craft, acting, and directing are all important for a well-rounded picture.
<BR/>Remembering your little mental exercise, you take a minute to reflect on your own status, too:
Personal Stress: 63%
Which do you put first in your professional life?
The Project: 38% The People: 62%
Personal Relationships:
The actress, Livia Lane: 53%
Your niece, Ada: 43%
The grip, Vic Martinez: 72%
<BR/>You've noticed lately that the crew has been getting pretty lazy. Jobs that should take ten minutes are taking two hours. There's a billiards table in C Stage. Maybe you should crack down on them a little harder, before this turns into a monkey house.

<BR/>You hop out of the car and hurry to B Stage. The crew's fiddling with last minute details, and the talent's all here, looking fantastic in their costumes. You round up the key players (including your director, Thomas Avery) for a quick pep talk before shooting begins.
<BR/>"Thank you all for being here," you say, rearranging your spring-colored scarves. "You all know what a struggle it's been to get to this moment. I can't tell you how excited and privileged I feel to be setting out on this journey with you all. Thanks for helping me realize my dream." Maria Ripley touches your shoulder and gives you a beautiful smile.
<BR/>You take a deep breath, looking around the circle. "Any questions?"
<BR/>"I've got one, Flowers," Thomas says. "What kind of pace are we shooting for? You okay with giving us time to do lots of retakes, so we have a little room to breathe? Or we trying to get this picture shot quick and cheap?"
<BR/><B>CHOICES:</B>
- "Let the actors take all the time they need to get the performances right."
- "Let the crew take all the time necessary to get the shot technically perfect."

<BR/><B>CHOICES:</B>
- the Academy ratio, 1.37 to 1. It's cheapest, and it's how films have always been shot.
- widescreen, 1.85 to 1. Only adds a little to the budget, but gives the film a distinct feel.

<BR/>"Rolling," the camera operator says.
<BR/>"And...action!" Vic slams the clapper down, making the cracking sound that will sync sound to picture in post, and steps back. Like magic, the first scene begins.
<BR/>The scene you're starting with today is from early in the script, when Maria's leader of the band of outcasts sings about her ordinary, humdrum life, little knowing how soon everything's going to change. The songs were all recorded over the past couple of weeks, so Maria just has to sing along to a recording of her own voice. The performance, coached carefully by Thomas Avery, leaps straight to the drunk heart of the character, and it's going to be a delight to see the footage when you watch the dailies tomorrow. As the day's shoot wears on, your direction from earlier seems to be paying off: the crew works quickly and efficiently, and the talent delivers good performances from the first take, meaning that before long you've already pulled a little ahead of the shooting schedule.

Catering's put out a modest, appetizing spread, but you're too keyed up for a meal, so you tide yourself over with a blueberry muffin.
<BR/>You're brushing the crumbs off your fingers when Eugene finds you and touches your arm, wearing an alarmed expression. "Flowers, we've got a couple of unauthorized visitors. I wouldn't have let them in myself, but..."
<BR/>You follow the nod to see two gentlemen standing in the gloom outside the studio light's glimmer, chatting easily with each other. One you don't recognize, but the other has a profile so distinct it's been parodied around town for years. It's been a year since you've seen that gaunt face above an immaculate bow tie, a year since you've smelled one of those Diego cigars.

<BR/>"Flowers Floyd," he says. "Sorry to drop in unannounced. Just wanted to offer congratulations on your new enterprise. Looks like your picture is off to a crackerjack start."
<BR/>"Mr. Croghan," you say, not taking the hand he offers. "And how's shooting on your own musical science fiction picture going?"
<BR/>He smiles, exhaling a mouthful of cigar smoke. "You were ahead of the game on that one, Floyd, I'll admit. Six months ago all the polls started telling us the science fiction genre was hot again. Didn't see it coming." He frowns, looking concerned. "I certainly hope you don't think we've stolen your ideas, Flowers. You know I'd never stoop to that. We have an entirely original concept, of course." He spreads his hands widely. "I hope if we're to be rivals, we can at least be friendly ones."
<BR/>This unexpected cordiality catches you off guard. What's he up to? Does he genuinely want to bury the hatchet, or is this some kind of power play?

<BR/>His face darkens. "Perhaps you don't realize, Miss Floyd, that we're at war. It's an easy fact to miss. This is not a war of uniforms and battlefields, like those of the past. This fight is on our own soil, and these enemies are spies and subversives. People who seem like good, ordinary Americans on the outside." He looks you up and down. "People who could be any one of us. Unless you want to wake up tomorrow and start speaking Russian, I'll hope to receive much more than the legally required cooperation from you."
<BR/>He pulls out a copy of your script. "I've had a chance to review the script for this production," he says, "despite your failure to provide a copy, as I requested of your staff. Fortunately, the copyright office was able to assist in my investigation." He flips through the script with a look of disdain. "I regret to say that this photoplay contains a number of elements the committee finds disappointing, if not downright unacceptable. Its perverted and unwholesome sexual themes. An appalling intensity and gratuitous assault on the senses. The smug, self-congratulatory intellectualism of its dialogue. I'm sure you'll be receptive to the changes I've suggested to make this more the kind of picture that wholesome American audiences would like to see." He smiles as he hands the script over.
<BR/>You flip through it lightly. It's filled with red pen marks: whole scenes are crossed out with a large red X, while many lines and individual words have been rewritten or altered to ridiculously inoffensive alternatives. These changes would seriously undermine your picture, there's no question about it. But you know he's got the power to cause your studio serious problems if you don't comply with his wishes.

<BR/>The rest of the first day's shoot goes well, and you manage to shrug off the unpleasant encounter at lunch. Thomas Avery directs with smooth competency, working through the shot list briskly and getting the footage that's needed. It's wonderful to watch Maria Ripley bring Jack Cooper's beautiful words to life. Maria seems to be struggling to slip into the role.
<BR/>As you start to find a rhythm with the crew, your style as a producer begins to take shape. You've given a lot of thought to this. Some producers treat their crews like a pirate captain under siege, barking orders fast and furious, cutting out weak links with brutal efficiency, and not giving a damn about hurt feelings or personal politics. Though rough on the people, sometimes it's the only way to drive them to greatness.
<BR/>On the other hand, some producers prefer a quieter approach: choosing politeness over efficiency, sacrificing rigor for good rapport. This too can be effective, if the crew comes together and bonds like a family, and really comes to care about the project. But it can also lead to sloppy work and turn projects into over-budget messes.

<BR/>At a quiet moment that afternoon, you're reviewing some footage and something incredible happens. You're taking some notes, momentarily distracted from the screen, when Eugene gasps. "Chief," he says, "look at that."
<BR/>You look up at the screen, where shots from a different scene have just started running by. You see at once what grabbed Gene's attention. Something about the lighting is simply magical. The light kisses the edges of Maria's face with a radiant glow, bringing the black and white film stock alive with a creamy, textured vividness. You remember this setup: you thought it looked okay at the time, but seeing it on celluloid is simply transporting.
<BR/>"Turned out okay, did it?" a familiar voice asks. You both turn around to see Vic Martinez, head poking into the dim screening room with a sheepish grin on their face.

<BR/>"Oh well," they say, matter-of-factly, "when I saw the way we were lighting this, I realized if we opened the shutter a little wider, and compensated with some filters on the backlights and the lens, we could push this a little more, provided we developed the footage just right." They grin a bit, seemingly in spite of themself. "Spoke to the D.P. about it while we were setting up, recommended we swap out to a different film stock that'd pick up the highlights a bit better. Helped the boys in the lab develop it just right, too." They look at the screen again, nodding appraisingly. "Turned out okay."
<BR/>Your eyes meet Eugene's briefly, reflecting your astonishment. You turn back to Vic. "You think you could keep working with the D.P. like that, Vic?" you ask. "Push a few more shots to get this effect?"
<BR/>They shrug. "Sure, if you think it's worth the effort."
<BR/>"I do," you say firmly. "And Vic?" you ask as they turn to go. "That's an awful lot of trouble you went to, just to make this one shot something special. Thank you."
<BR/>They turn red. "Ah, it weren't nothing," they say. "Besides, Flowers, you've been such a good friend to me, when most people in your position would never even have noticed I existed. I felt like the least I could do is try to give you something special in return." They duck quickly out of the room, and you turn back to Eugene, shaking your head.
<BR/>"People are full of surprises," you say.

<BR/><I>FLOYD MUSICAL SCIENCE FICTION PICTURE STARTS PRODUCTION WITH RIPLEY</I>
<span class="floydstyle em">Tiny newcomer Studio McStudioface's lot was bustling with activity yesterday as director Thomas Avery began shooting Outcast Odyssey, the upstart studio's racy rockets and rayguns picture. Spirits were high on set, bolstered by surprise visitor Lloyd Croghan delivering well wishes to former prot&eacute;g&eacute; Floyd. Production seems off to a smash start, although word around set is the picture's already overbudget. After a few weeks of studio work, the struggling independent's next challenge: a tricky location shoot.</span>
<BR/>Hrmph. But you tap a pencil on that last sentence. Whatever hack reporter dredged this up is right about one thing: the location shoot's going to be your toughest challenge yet.

<BR/>Time passes...
The low level of crew stress improves the directing.
The high quality of the direction so far improves the craft.
The low level of crew stress slightly improves the film's craft.
The film is a little over budget, and this slightly increases the crew's stress.

I was just watching the operator while I was thinking!"). Chatting about the day's work, the two of you walk across the lot to your parking space. But when you see your car, you come to a dead halt, the color draining from your face.
<BR/>Your tires have been slashed, and spray-painted across your rear window are these words:

You knew with this new wave of anti-Communist sentiment sweeping through your industry that you might take some professional hits for your beliefs. You've made your choices about how to treat Congressman Creed and his supporters, and you stand by them.
<BR/>But you never thought about your professional decisions touching your personal life like this, and the lives of the people close to you. You've heard people say "Better dead than Red" before. You never stopped to think about who might actually mean it.
<BR/>Was whoever did this still watching when you walked out of B Stage, absentmindedly chatting with Ada?
<BR/>Would they hurt her, just for being close to you?
<BR/>You pour yourself a drink, trying to clear your head. Maybe you'll have to be more careful what you say in the future. If you're starting to become visible as a public figure protesting Creed's committee, maybe you need to start doing something to fight against that perception and step back out of the spotlight.

Maria Ripley is doing the best she can in her role, but the performance isn't quite as memorable as you were hoping it'd be. The crew are working smoothly and efficiently, and seem to be balancing the project's stress with a casual ease on set, keeping hold of enough stamina to make it through the rest of the shoot.

<BR/>You've been having trouble sleeping lately. Every night you're exhausted when your head hits the pillow, but you just lie there, heart racing, mind cooking. If you don't find a way to lose some of this stress, you're going to wind up in the hospital, or maybe an early grave. These are the cheerful thoughts that run through your head at night.

<BR/>After the frantic run-up to departure and a successful couple of days on location, today you're just killing time while some logistics get sorted out before tomorrow's shoot. Remembering you wanted a postcard to pin on your office wall, you flip through a rack at the post office, finally picking one that really shows off your location:

- desert dunes as far as the eye can see.
- an exotic jungle.
- a tropical beach.

<BR/>Yes, this will be a good souvenir for the shoot. You could use some color after the unpleasantness when you arrived. You weren't prepared to deal with the border guards confiscating the recording equipment. Hopefully the rest of the shoot will be smoother.
<BR/>A few of those little details aside, the trip's been lovely so far. Having the whole ensemble cast on the road has been a logistical nightmare, but now that you're all here, it's wonderful. The scenery is stunning, and it's going to look breathtaking in glorious black and white, sprawling across those wide silver screens: a beautiful crescent beach of clean white sand, under a sky so blue it hurts. There's been delicious food, too: you sampled some kind of amazing grilled fish yesterday, and have been craving more ever since.

<BR/>As you take your postcard to the front of the shop, you bump into Livia Lane, clutching a handful of souvenirs. "Flowers!" she says, smiling broadly, "isn't this place phenomenal? I was thinking of you last night: a few of us were eating dinner at this little bungalow we found. The owner was this tiny little woman, and she cooked us up a delicious meal...absolutely delicious, Flowers, you've no idea... but she just fawned over us the whole time. We wanted an authentic experience, you know, what's the right way to eat this, what sauces go where. But whatever we guessed first, she always said, 'Yes, yes, absolutely right!' She refilled our drinks whenever we took the tiniest sip, laughed at even our most long-in-the-tooth jokes...she so wanted to make us happy, I suppose."
<BR/>She gives you a mock frown. "Reminded me of you, chief. Just a smidge. Do nothing but bend over backwards to make everyone happy, sometimes you end up doing just the opposite." She winks and rings up her postcard. Smiling, you shake your head and finish paying for your own.
<BR/>Sounds like everyone's already collecting plenty of stories to tell the folks back home...
<BR/><B>CHOICES:</B>
- ...although that won't be for a long time, because most of the film will be shot on location.
- ...in a while, since a good third of the film is on location.

<BR/>The next morning, everyone is up at the crack of dawn to roll out to the shooting location in a small convoy of rented trucks laden with gear.

<BR/>You start barking orders and rallying the troops...there's no time for this dillydallying. Folks start looking a bit more lively, and soon everything gets loaded up and you're on the road. You end up squeezed into a truck with your director, Mr. Avery, heading out over the sand in the predawn light.
<BR/>Thomas suffers the bumpy road in silent dignity for a while, then turns to you. "Oh, Flowers, I've been meaning to discuss something with you. It's the ending again. Yes, I know, but the more I think about it, the more I just don't think it's true to Maria's character. For the leader of those outcasts to go through everything she does, and then make a decision like that so abruptly...it just rings false, don't you think?"
<BR/>You've been worried this was going to come up again. Thomas just doesn't seem to like Jack Cooper's ending, despite your assurances to him that you've thought long and hard about it and that it's definitely the best way for the story to end.
<BR/>On the other hand, a director likes to feel like he's got creative control. Even though he's wrong, maybe letting him get his way just this once will keep him happy for a while.
<BR/><B>CHOICES:</B>
- Flatly refuse to change the ending.
- Agree to discuss it with him for a while, but stick to my guns, even if it'll be a stressful conversation.

<BR/>You're in the middle of a take when a deafening crash of thunder booms around you. Seconds later, it starts to rain. And not just rain...downpour.
<BR/>"Oh lord, the equipment!" Eugene shouts. A mad scramble ensues. By the time you get the gear squared away, everyone is drenched, some of the gear is ruined, and nobody is very happy.

<BR/>You thought you had a good definition for the word "terrifying," but driving back to the bungalow through blinding flashes of lightning, howling wind, and enough rain to give the Hoover Dam an overspill changes your mind. Fortunately, the storm blows itself out soon, lingering as only a mild drizzle, but the road's become a muddy disaster in the meantime. Your trucks are sliding around like ducks in a skating rink. And then the one in front of yours gets hopelessly mired, back wheel spinning in a quagmire of black mud.
<BR/>"All hands on deck!" someone shouts. "Let's push!"
<BR/>Maria Ripley, riding in the truck that's stuck, climbs gamely out to help, slogging through the mud to join the crowd assembling near the rear.

At first it seems like the truck's dug in too deep to escape. Then, with an obscene squelch, the truck lurches forward...and Maria collapses face-first into the mud.
<BR/>Scores of hands move to help her up, but she's only got eyes for the source of the uproarious laughter coming from somewhere nearby. A few paces away, reasonably dry under a black umbrella, stands Livia Lane, who can't stop giggling.
<BR/>"Find this amusing, do you?" Maria asks, with a futile attempt to wipe mud off her front, eyes staring daggers at Livia.
<BR/>"I'm sorry, dear, really I am," she says, still grinning broadly, "just couldn't help myself. Didn't know we were making a comedy."
<BR/>Shrugging off Vic Martinez, who's rushed over with a towel and umbrella, Maria walks calmly up to Livia, looks her in the eye. And before anyone can stop her, gives her a hard shove.
<BR/>Livia shrieks and falls straight into a mudbank, crying out in pain. "My arm! Why you stuck-up, grandstanding little girl," she says, clutching one arm while struggling ineffectually to get to her feet. "Let me at her. I'm going to kill her."

<BR/>You hoped by next morning the whole thing would blow over, but the mood at breakfast is sour. Livia's sleeves are pointedly rolled up to show a purpling bruise, while Maria sits on the other side of the room talking loudly to her stand-in and ignoring everyone else.
<BR/>You're brooding over your breakfast, trying to decide what to do, when Vic catches your eye and nods towards the door. The two of you step outside into the already simmering morning sunlight.
<BR/>"Flowers, you've got to do something," they say, skipping the pleasantries. "This kind of thing can poison a production if left unresolved. Tensions were high last night, and they both acted unprofessionally, but now it's your job to make sure this doesn't balloon into something more serious." They fold their arms. "I know you usually put the project first and trust this kind of thing to sort itself out, but not this time."
<BR/>Maybe they're right. Squabbling is the last thing you need right now. Maybe a pointed intervention could nip a brooding feud in the bud. On the other hand, it's a distraction from the job at hand: getting this film in the can. And there's always the chance that by sticking your oar in you make things even worse. What should you do?
<BR/><B>CHOICES:</B>

<BR/>"Vic, I spent years at Croghan's studio massaging bruised egos and pulling productions through rough spots," you say with a grin. "Leave this to me."
<BR/>The mood is sullen at first when you start in on what everyone assumes is a lecture, but this isn't the first temper tantrum you've smoothed over. By the time you're finished, you've not only gotten everyone fired up about the picture again, you think you've even made Maria and Livia a little embarrassed at their overreaction. They're coolly cordial to each other as the day's shoot winds up, but by sundown they're laughing together again, and even clink glasses over dinner. Looks like you've saved the day.
<BR/>The weather finally does settle down, and the rest of the location shoot passes uneventfully. With some luck, maybe that'll be the last of the major crises.

<BR/>Ice clinks as Fish pours you a few generous fingers of brandy. You take the cool glass from him and lean back in your desk chair, closing your eyes for one yearning moment as your friend pours a glass for himself. It's been a long day: your plans for a five o'clock drink got pushed back to a six o'clock drink, and evolved at last into a creeping-up-on-seven-already drink flavored with exhausted apologies. Fish laughed them down, though, waiting patiently for the day's shoot to wind down and for you to have a free moment.
<BR/>He clinks glasses with you and raises a toast to "soldiering on." You take a grateful swallow that burns like an oak-paneled drawing room. Another day behind you.
<BR/>"This is good stuff," you say, eyeing the amber-colored liquid appreciatively. "Where'd you find it?"
<BR/>"My little secret," he says with a smile. "But you're damn right it's the good stuff. Sounded like you needed it, chief. How's your shoot going?"

<BR/>Shooting's well past the halfway mark now, but there's still a lot of hard work to come. A lot of complex special effects shots still need to be captured, and coordinating everything requires precise communication between your production and postproduction teams, meaning a lot of painstaking, exacting work. Despite all the hard work, you can't imagine anything more energizing than watching the film come together, day by day and shot by shot. It's shaping up to be something grand.
<BR/>"You think I'm handling things okay, Grundy?" you ask, swirling your glass and staring at the amber liquid musingly. "Any advice for a greenhorn producer?"
<BR/>Fish scratches his beard reflectively. "If I were you," he says, "and, now, don't take this the wrong way. It's a common rookie mistake. You really ought to do something about this office." He knocks the bare drywall with a sad shake of his head. "Some paint, a few pictures, hell, even an interesting crack or two. Ain't nobody going to take you seriously as a big shot producer with an office like this."
<BR/><B>NEXT PAGE...</B>
<BR/>You grin, shaking your head. "And how are you holding up, you rascal? Any new projects in the works?"
<BR/>"Got some irons in the fire," he grins. "Something'll come up Fish Grundy soon enough. Oh," he adds, "you'll get a kick out of this. Guess who paid me a visit night before last?" He raises his glass in a mock salute, downing the last swallow of brandy. "Your old friend, Congressman Jonathan Creed."
<BR/>"Creed?" you say with a frown. "I'd almost forgotten. Haven't heard a peep out of him since his little visit on our first day's shoot. Thought maybe he'd forgotten about us."
<BR/>"Politicians are a bit like mosquitoes, Flowers," Fish says. "You think they've buzzed off, found someone else to hassle, and then zzzzip"&mdash;he skips his hand off your desk&mdash;"they get right up in your ear and start whining their butts off. No sirree, you can bet Creed's still keeping his fingers in the Studio McStudioface pie."

<BR/>"Oh, probably just lonely, poor little fella," Fish says, lifting a corner of his mouth. "Had all kinds of questions for me. Was real concerned about rumors he's heard, that ol' Fish Grundy might be sympathetic to the Communist party. Asked him if having sympathetic feelings is a crime these days in Mr. Eisenhower's America. He got all serious-like, leaned forward, says…'It can be, Mr. Grundy. It can be.'"
<BR/>You lift a corner of your mouth at Fish's deadpan impression. "I can only imagine what happened next."
<BR/>"No, no!" he says, lifting his hands, "I was real sweet to the little fella. He said I'd been seen entering and leaving the apartments at 99 Maplewood, where a known member of the Communist party holds regular meetings, save us. I said a lot of people live at 99 Maplewood. He asked if I'd care to share the name of such a person whom I might have been visiting on these occasions, and I politely declined.
<BR/>"Well," he adds reflectively when you raise an eyebrow, "I believe I told him my private affairs were none of his goddamn business and he could run along off for a warrant if he really wanted to piss away American tax dollars investigating me for entering and leaving an apartment building in broad daylight, and didn't mind becoming a laughingstock down to the police station, where I believe they're pretty big fans of Hollywood legend Fish Grundy and don't cotton to frivolous, crybaby demands on police time." He taps a finger against his cheek with a frown. "S'pose that wasn't too polite after all, come to think of it."

<BR/>After seeing Fish out, you head back to your place to freshen up for an evening out. Skimming the Times yesterday, you spotted an ad for a revival of one of your favorite films at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre. With a pang, you realized it's been months since you've gone to the movies purely for the fun of it, and a night out sounded instantly appealing. After some thought, you decided to…

<BR/>For the first time in years, you find yourself speaking honestly about your past, your failings alongside your successes. It's been so long since you broke from your standard spiel, the pieces you usually leave out are sharper: jagged bits of yourself you'd rather forget. Having your ideas laughed at, being told a woman could never make it in this business. Petty revenges. Years in a tiny stifling attic room, barely scraping together each month's rent, one gig away from living on the street. No letters home, and none from.
<BR/>Vic listens, looking up at the theater's grand dome, without judging or praising anything. Just listens. Until you finally peter out, afraid of how much you've said, and why.
<BR/>"Thanks, Flowers," they say quietly. "That was a better story than I was expecting."
<BR/>You take a deep breath. "I've been doing too much talking," you say. "Tell me about being a grip. What do you like about it?"

<BR/>"But why work in the movies, then?" you ask, leaning forward. "You could do manual labor anywhere. Or be a mechanic, like you said." They chuckle. "So why Hollywood?"
<BR/>They raise an eyebrow at you. "Cause you meet the damnedest people in this business, Flowers."
<BR/><B>NEXT PAGE...</B>
<BR/>There's more to it than that, of course. As you get Vic talking, you slowly start to build a picture of how they see the world. Though they never quite come out and say it, it's clear they really love Hollywood for making magic happen. The right studio light shining through a set window to perfectly mimic a summer afternoon, even if it's winter midnight outside; a trucking shot so smooth it's like pulling the audience's soul slowly forward toward destiny. Engines that purr. The impossible made effortless. They get an almost impish look when talking about these things, a look of supreme confidence, as if they're pulling one over on the universe and nothing can stop them. It's rather endearing.
<BR/>You discover that one of their hobbies is building model airplanes. "Used to take them down to the lake," they say, reaching into the bag of popcorn and pulling out a perfectly popped specimen. "Give 'em a bit of sidewalk for a runway, rig a wound-up rubber band to the propeller, watch 'em soar." They shake their head. "Drove Mel up the wall. Couldn't see the point. Always said it was a giant waste of time, let alone money."
<BR/>"Mel?" you ask.
<BR/>They stiffen up, then look away abruptly. "We've had a nice time so far tonight," they say. "Let's not talk about that."

I don't really care for most color pictures. Here they spend all this money to snatch up all them shades in perfect detail, make everything look real as life. But life's got too much color already, you ask me." They sigh. "I want my stories flickering, washed out, painted with light. Perfect. Nothing like down here at all."

<BR/>Apparently they are. At a certain moment their arm shifts over gracefully to behind your shoulders. You slide towards them, and they snuggle into you with a sigh.
<BR/>It's a good night out at the movies.
<BR/>When the curtain drops, you both meander out into the hot summer night, chattering about the picture: favorite lines, perfect moments. The golden lights of the marquee make your faces glow like movie stars. A moment comes, a lull in the conversation, and their eyes twinkle in the warm bulbs as they look up at you, cheeks still flushed from Destination Moon. You feel the moment gather like a wave above to crest, a baseball at the top of an arc.

<BR/>Your lips meet before either of you can stop them, shattering the question of whether you should. The moment holds its breath with you, as if together you can defy gravity, stop time, fly to the moon in a silvery rocket ship.
<BR/>When you pull back, the look on their face mirrors your inner thoughts: mischievous and giddy, like a bandit with a roller coaster for a getaway car, careening towards something grand.
<BR/>"Thanks for a wonderful night at the movies, Martinez," you say.
<BR/>"My pleasure, Floyd," they say back. You hail a cab, thinking happy thoughts.
<BR/>As you hold the door open for them, they pause, attention snared by something off in the distance. "Looks like a fire over there," they say.
<BR/>You follow their glance to see a plume of smoke turned pale orange by city light, spilling into the sky. "Yeah," you say almost languidly, as if caught in slow motion, "and isn't that awfully close to…?"
<BR/>They nod, biting a lip, confirming your fearful geography. The spell breaks and something clenches in your stomach: now everything moves much too quickly. "Driver!" you shout, hustling Vic into the cab and following right on their heels, "follow that smoke, fast!"

<BR/>The closer the cab gets to the column of smoke, the further your heart sinks. It's not a trick of the night or perspective. It's more and more clear that the fire is coming from the Studio McStudioface lot.
<BR/>As the cabbie screeches around the final corner, your breath trips somewhere in your throat. Vic lets out a little gasp of despair. B Stage is burning. Smoke erupts from cracks in the walls and great licks of flame dance behind the upper windows. A small crowd, including members of your crew, has gathered under the cast-iron sign, silhouetted black against the fire's glow.
<BR/>You jump out of the cab and rush forward. "Is anyone inside?" you shout at a kid you recognize as a set runner.
<BR/>"Dunno, chief," he says. "Some people been working late this week, but no clue if anyone was in there tonight. Sure ain't seen anyone come out, though."

<BR/>You have only seconds to decide what to do. If the fire spreads to C Stage, most of your props and costumes could be destroyed, not to mention the negatives of all the footage you've shot. You can't imagine a worse disaster for your production. But if anyone's trapped in B Stage, by the time the fire department gets here it might be too late to help them.
<BR/>Maybe you could galvanize the crowd into action, but with the stress you've been under lately, you're hardly at your best as a leader just now. And on the other hand, you can already hear the sirens getting closer: maybe you should leave this to the professionals. You'd never forgive yourself if anything happened to your team, or to Vic, because you were trying to play the hero.
<BR/><B>CHOICES:</B>
- Turn to B Stage, to look for survivors.
- Turn to C Stage, to save the negatives.

<BR/>You start barking orders, and people begin to respond. You've been a leader before, after all. People are slow to get moving at first, but soon you've rallied a handful of troops, people eager to do what they can.
<BR/>"Okay, people," you say, tucking a scarf back into position, "we need one team to look for anyone still in B Stage, and another to ferry the negatives out from C." You check yourself, suddenly remembering something. "Actually, scratch that. We moved the negatives to B last week. So the second team'll form a bucket brigade, try to keep it from catching fire."
<BR/>Thank God you've kept cool enough to remember that…if you'd been more stressed out, that's the kind of crucial detail that might have slipped your mind.
<BR/>"Let's move out!" you shout. "Be quick, and be careful!"
<BR/><B>NEXT PAGE...</B>
<BR/>Your people are off at a run. You stay outside on point, relaying info and barking orders.
<BR/>Before long, the B team reports no signs of life in the burning soundstage, thank God. It's a good thing you haven't been pushing your crew harder, or who knows what might have happened. Without a rescue effort to distract them, the team has managed to save a few vital props and set pieces from the blaze.
<BR/>The other team moves swiftly and efficiently to set up a bucket brigade, dousing C Stage's walls and roof with water.
<BR/>By the time the fire department's left, hours later, clouds have moved in and the night is black and grim. You stand looking desolately at the smoking remains of B Stage. Most of it still stands, but it's totally gutted. It'll take a lot of money to rebuild…money you don't have.
<BR/>Vic takes your hand. "What's going to happen to Studio McStudioface now, Floyd?" they ask. "What'll happen to Outcast Odyssey?"
<BR/>You shake your head. "I don't know, darling. I really don't know."

<BR/>The gate swings opens with a mechanical whir, and you nudge your car through, fingers clammy on the steering wheel. The winding curves of Mulholland and its lovely view usually clear your head, but today the drive just made you dizzy, more aware than ever of sheer drop-offs: one wrong turn from disaster. This might be your last chance to save your studio.
<BR/>In the wake of the fire, all hell's broken loose. Production has come to a dead halt while you drown in investigations and red tape: the police haven't ruled out arson, and the insurance investigators haven't ruled out fraud.
<BR/>What's become clear is this: getting Outcast Odyssey back into production and completed will take a lot of money, and fast: more than Studio McStudioface's got by a long shot. You talked to the bank, but they won't help you. Your personal savings were already bled dry. What you need is a new private investor.
<BR/>Hell. What you need is a Hail Mary.

<BR/>"Now remember," Eugene had said, hovering nervously outside the car while you angled the rearview mirror to take one last look at yourself, "don't talk about the money right away. Put your best foot forward, get her interested. Reel her in. Be firm about how much we need, but try not to come off as rude or presumptuous. And don't seem too desperate! These big-money types can smell despair on you, actually smell it."
<BR/>"You're a groundswell of encouragement, Gene," you replied grimly, starting the engine.
<BR/>He sighed, and reached through the open window to pat your shoulder. "You'll do fine, Floyd. Just…bring home the bacon, all right?"

The grounds, though fussily well-maintained, nevertheless have a strange air of neglect, like a toy that's never been unwrapped. Rounding a bend, you see the house itself, smaller than you expected but richly appointed: you're almost surprised there's not a line of footmen in livery waiting to greet you.
<BR/>You park in the gravel circle and walk up the steps with all the confidence you can muster. Within moments of your sharp rap on the door, it's opened by a well-dressed butler.
<BR/>"Floyd," he says with a small bow, escorting you into the marble-floored entrance hall. "Mrs. Garbo is just finishing an important telephone call and will be with you shortly. She wished me to express how much she is looking forward to this meeting." He gestures with a white-gloved hand toward a pair of elegant French doors. "You're welcome to wait in the library, if you please."
<BR/>You do please, and moments later find yourself in a well-appointed room lined with well-appointed bookshelves.

<BR/>Running your finger across the spines, you remember Greta's love for reading, a purer form of storytelling than the endless compromises and imperfections of moving pictures. Looking around the walls, you don't see a single shred of her Hollywood past: no posters, no framed photos. You hope you haven't made a mistake in dredging up a part of her life she'd rather forget.
<BR/>Glancing round the rest of the room, you notice an abandoned newspaper with a familiar face on the cover. Picking it up from an overstuffed chair, you smooth it out and stare in growing dismay at the headline:
<BR/><I>SILENT-ERA FUNNYMAN FISH GRUNDY HELD IN CONTEMPT
<BR/>Fish Grundy, golden-age stage and screen star, was held in contempt of court today for pleading the Fifth at a special congressional hearing. Mr. Grundy was subpoenaed by Congressman Jonathan Creed to testify about Communist activity in Hollywood. The actor is alleged to have attended a number of Party meetings at a well-known Red address, 99 Maplewood Street in Los Angeles, and to have met there a number of Party members with connections to Soviet spy networks and propaganda machines. Charges have not been filed against Mr. Grundy, but his name is expected to be added to the Hollywood blacklist.</I>

<BR/>The double doors creak open behind you before you have time to think things through. You try to put the matter from your mind and turn around with a smile as Greta Garbo steps into the room.

<BR/>"I wonder if you'd care for some hors d'oeuvres?" she asks, beckoning towards the door. The butler steps smoothly in, balancing a silver platter. He places it on an oak sideboard and pulls off the lid, revealing some gooey piles of round balls topped with a pasty green sauce.
<BR/>"Roe of gejang topped with lobster tomalley," she says, gesturing to the platter but not moving to sample it herself. "The roe are, of course, the eggs of a rather unpleasant-looking little fish. The tomalley is the liquified insides of a lobster, specifically the bits that filter out impurities, apparently. It's the latest delicacy at all the society parties. Won't you try a bite?"

<BR/>You've never acquired much of a taste for gourmet food. In fact, you tend to stick with pastrami whenever you can get it. So you're not prepared for the explosion of rancid flavors, the mealy texture of the bitter, oozy sauce, the tiny squelch of each rank fish egg bursting in your mouth. This is possibly the most vile thing you've ever tasted.

<BR/>Greta's butler sets up a small projector and screen. You thread up the reel and run the footage, crossing your fingers.
<BR/>There's only a handful of scenes, and the editing is rough: just good takes spliced together in more or less the right order. Watching the footage, you can't help but feel self-conscious. Nothing's really jumping out: neither the acting, nor the directing, not even the technical details. You're worried the whole thing just comes off as bland mediocrity.
<BR/>As you pull the curtains to let daylight flood back into the room, Greta seems nonplussed. "Hard to get much of a sense of it from that…so unfinished…" You decide to move on to something else, before she can talk herself into disliking it.

Time passes…
The low level of crew stress improves the directing.
The high quality of the direction so far improves the acting.
Your tendency to prioritize the project over the people slightly increases your crew's stress.
The film is a little over budget, and this slightly increases the crew's stress.
Garbo's consulting slightly improves the quality of the acting.

<BR/><B>NEXT CHAPTER!</B>
<BR/>Chapter Eight
<BR/>And before you know it, you're back in business.
<BR/>The rest of the shoot goes relatively smoothly, but Greta's funding only goes so far. You have to beg favors from old friends and be extremely stingy with the checkbook to get back on your feet again. But the film gets finished, shot by shot.
<BR/>True to her word, Greta checks in on you from time to time, asking for status reports and offering the occasional piece of advice. You do have to bite your tongue now and then, and make the occasional decision you feel is wrong for the film, in order to keep her happy. This seems to annoy your director, Thomas Avery, but there's nothing to be done about it. You made the deal you made. Fortunately, her intrusions overall are rare.
<BR/>Finally, the last day of your shoot arrives, and then, at the end of a long, grueling day, the final shot. The crew grows respectfully hushed as Thomas calls for take after take of a short but crucial monologue from the end of the second act. After a whispered consultation with the camera operator, he gives the thumbs up.
<BR/>"That's a wrap!" Gene calls, and the studio bursts into cheers. Ada runs up to Maria Ripley and throws her arms around her. "You were great, Maria!" she says.

<BR/>"We did it, Flowers," she says. "Congratulations."
<BR/>"We're not out of the woods yet," you say. "There's still so much to do. Editing, music, sound mixing, marketing…" Your ability to continue speaking is interrupted by the pastry Livia has deftly maneuvered into your mouth.

<BR/>"There you are," Greta says. You see her holding court near the back hall, drink in one hand and a tiny dog in the other, accompanied by a large man with an instantly familiar face. "Flowers, do you know Orson?"
<BR/>You've never met Mr. Welles in person, but of course you know his films. He's put on some weight in the last decade, but it's just made him even more imposing. "A pleasure, sir," you say, extending a hand.
<BR/>Orson, who's been admiring a large stuffed penguin in the hall, turns back to you with a mildly inebriated smile. "Beautiful bird," he says (and that voice is just as hypnotic in person), "an adult emperor, if I'm correct. But yes, congratulations are certainly in order, my dear, on your successes so far. Here's to many more." He finishes his glass in a large swallow with a flourish, then frowns in the direction of the bar.

Wriggling free from Greta's arms with a snarl, he manages to give your hand a vicious bite as he races off into the crowd.
<BR/>Clutching your bleeding hand, you say a word you wish in hindsight you hadn't invoked in front of Mr. Welles. Greta finishes sopping up her spilled drink with a napkin, which she hands to you with an apologetic cluck.
<BR/>"I'm so sorry," she says. "Mr. Rickles is never like this. Probably frightened of all these people, poor thing."
<BR/>"He needs his blue bone," Orson mutters, frowning and still staring in the general direction of the bar, apparently unperturbed by the drama. You begin to wonder if he isn't further gone than he's letting on when Greta touches his arm.
<BR/>"Mr. Rickles used to be Orson's," she says. "I adopted him when his daddy had to go to Europe for a while. What did you used to call him, Orson darling? Before he came to live with me?"

<BR/>"Chief!" he says. "I came straight from the office of the arson investigator. They said any potential evidence was almost certainly destroyed in the fire, but they found something you might want to see. They say there's no prints or anything they can work with, so they turned it over to—"
<BR/>"Slow down," you say, grabbing both flailing wrists and bringing them gently to his side. "It can wait a minute. Take your jacket off, get a drink, then we'll take a look-see."

<BR/>Mr. Rickles, gripping the tube in his teeth and gnashing at it furiously, snarls up at you.
<BR/>"Give that here, you mutt!" you shout, reaching down. But the tiny dog leaps back, growls, turns and sprints back into the thick of the party, gripping the cardboard tube tight in his slobbery little jowls.

<BR/>"By the way, Mr. Welles," you say, "I want to tell you I'm a huge fan of the editing in your pictures, especially Citizen Kane. The pacing and match cuts in the opera house scene are especially marvelous."
<BR/>"You think so?" Orson says, brightening. "I thought everyone had forgotten about that picture by now. Of course, Bob Wise has to take much of the credit, although we did plan everything out together in rather excruciating detail."
<BR/>You pepper Orson with technical questions, and he seems to relish the chance to discuss nitty-gritty with an expert. At one point, needing his hands to illustrate a complex camera setup, he absentmindedly shifts the dog off his lap and sets him loose. Nodding and smiling, you desperately keep one eye on the mutt as it trots away into the party. By the time you're able to wrap up the conversation and make your excuses, you've completely lost track of him, though at least you've pried him from Orson's overprotective fingers.

<BR/>Over by the fireplace, Fish Grundy's still standing alone, holding a flute of champagne and staring contemplatively into the fire.
<BR/>Mr. Rickles kneels on the carpet before the fire, worrying at the blue tube with yellowed teeth!
<BR/>"Grundy, grab that dog!" you shout.
<BR/>Fish blinks in surprise. "Uh, sure thing, Flowers," he says, setting his champagne on the mantel and kneeling down. "Here, boy," he says, holding out a hand and inching forward. "Come to papa…"
<BR/>But the dog's having none of it: he leaps to his feet, snarling around the tube, and darts through Fish's legs back toward the throng. Though Fish reaches down with the reflexes of a catfish noodler to snatch him, he misses by a hair's breadth and his momentum carries him into a full forward roll, leaving him lying on his back, blinking and confused.
<BR/>"Slippery varmint," he mutters as you help him up.
<BR/>You sigh. "Old friend, I think I need your help."
<BR/>He laughs when you tell him the score, clown tassels tinkling as he shakes his head. "Looks like we got ourselves a regular screwball comedy in the works. Just need a long-lost twin brother and a stack of pies, we'll be ready to shoot. Come on, let's go find that mutt."

<BR/>A grin breaks out across Fish's face like the sunrise glinting off an especially devious pond. "Flowers, I'm glad you asked." He taps a finger to his nose, and whispers: "Watch this."
<BR/>Rummaging around in his baggy clown pants, he produces a can of mixed nuts from some deep pocket with a flourish, politely offering it to the Goldwyn. "Care for a light snack, madam?" he asks.
<BR/>"Why thank you," she says, accepting it and fumbling with the lid. "It's such a bother to make one's way all the way over to the AAAIIEEEEEEEE!!!"
<BR/>This bloodcurdling outburst follows the explosion of a four-foot-long mottled snake from the can, and accompanies the Goldwyn (and the contents of her drink) flying through the air in a colorful, frenetic blur. A dozen people leap to her aid and, supporting her on a bed of concerned muttering, escort her off to a quieter part of the house to recover, with many a dirty glance shot Fish Grundy's way.
<BR/>"I'm afraid your reputation may never recover," you say, handing Fish the rubber snake.
<BR/>He shoves it back into the can and grins. "If they can't take a joke…"
<BR/><B>NEXT PAGE...</B>
<BR/>You lift up a corner of the couch as Fish waits nearby, crouched like a catcher at a ballgame. In a streak of mottled fur, the dog zips straight toward him. "Gotcha!" Fish shouts, but the dog bounds off his outstretched hands, sails through his clown wig with a muffled whoomp, and races off into the back hall.
<BR/>"You know," Grundy says, patting his wig with a frown, "I'm really starting to dislike that dog."
<BR/>"There's no way out of that hall," you say. "Let's get this over with."
<BR/><B>NEXT PAGE...</B>
<BR/>You race into the now abandoned hall with Grundy. Mr. Rickles, still gripping the tube in his tireless jaws, growls at you and backs up, but is starting to realize he's cornered. You've got him now.
<BR/>"Fish, cover me!" you hiss, advancing carefully. Something like fear flashes through the dog's black eyes, but only for a moment, replaced by the grim stoicism of a soldier leaping from a trench. As you move closer, he backs into the farthest corner of the room, wriggling his hindquarters and readying for a Hail Mary leap.
<BR/>"Gotcha," you say, pouncing. The dog springs forward in a desperate bound, just escaping your grasping fingers, flies straight into the marble plinth supporting the stuffed penguin, and keels over, knocked clear out.
<BR/>You wrest the tube from the dog's jaws, clenched tight even in sleep. "All in a good day's work," Fish says, stepping forward to help you. Then he halts, eyes widening as you both hear a familiar booming voice approaching from the direction of the party. You look at each other, then down at the rather dead-looking dog and your hand on the tube.
<BR/>Orson's lumbering shadow spills into the hallway. You've got only seconds till he catches you kneeling over his comatose former pooch. You've got to hide the dog…
<BR/><B>CHOICES:</B>
- …down Fish's oversized clown pants.

<BR/>Seconds later, Orson steps into the hallway to see you and Fish standing side by side, all smiles, Fish's hand casually patting some loose stuffing back into the bird.
<BR/>"Gentleman, madam," Orson says, tipping his hat unsteadily. "Just looking for the little boy's room." His eyes shift to Fish and widen. He shakes your friend's hand vigorously. "And Mr. Grundy," he says. "Wonderful to see you again. Heard about this dreadful blacklist nonsense. An absolute disgrace." Welles shakes his head. "You know you'd be welcome at my new production house on the Continent. We'd give you such roles to play!"
<BR/>"Thank you, Mr. Welles," Grundy says with a broad smile, a single bead of sweat rolling down his forehead. "But my home's here in Hollywood. Can't see myself ever getting too far from it."
<BR/>"Neither could I," Orson says moodily, "once."
<BR/>"The restroom's right this way, sir," Fish says, starting to take his hand off the penguin to point and then quickly replacing it when the thing shifts unsteadily.
<BR/>Orson nods, about to lumber by, then turns with a thoughtful look on his face and regards you seriously.
<BR/>"Flowers, a word of advice," he says. "You're a promising talent, really very promising, and I…" He pauses, sighing heavily and staring into the distance. "I would hate to see you make the same mistakes I did."
<BR/>"Oh yes, sir?" you say. Once you dreamed of getting career advice from Orson Welles. Now that the moment's come, you find yourself rather distracted. A faint rustling comes from somewhere inside the penguin, but Orson doesn't seem to notice.

<BR/>Orson nods, fixing you with a paternal gaze filled with heartfelt camaraderie perhaps not quite merited by your acquaintance so far. "It's a terrible machine, Hollywood," he says. "Lifts people up and spits them out after strangling their souls, trying to package them into tiny identical pieces. Turning art to meat, marketing it to executives, housewives, middle school principals. Real voices, real stories terrify them. You've seen that. You know the score. But."
<BR/>The penguin rustles more loudly and a muffled, groggy whimper comes from somewhere inside it. Orson frowns and glances at the bird for a moment, then shakes his head and turns back to you.
<BR/>"Don't let them commodify you, Flowers," Orson says in a voice like he's auditioning for the role of God: even though currently flavored with vodka, it's hard to ignore. "But worse, don't commodify yourself. Stay true to your dreams. No matter what it costs you."
<BR/>"I will, Mr. Welles," you say, with all the seriousness you can muster given your current circumstances.
<BR/>A yelp comes from inside the stuffed penguin, which starts rocking gently. Fish, who still has his hand near it, smiles weakly.
<BR/>Orson frowns at him. "And Mr. Grundy…that bird is a priceless heirloom, not a toy. Good evening." He grunts and proceeds into the washroom.

<BR/>Two minutes later, with a vestige of normalcy returned and the dog limping woozily back towards the party, you've shaken hands with Fish and at last get a moment alone with the evidence tube. Though marred with tooth marks and rather wetter than before, it's still intact. You rip off the seal and upend the contents into your hand.
<BR/>All that's inside is a small brown nub no bigger than your thumb. Frowning, you pick it up and hold it to the light, and that's when you see what it is: the stub of a cigar.

<BR/>"Well," you say, brushing off a spring-colored scarf, "this is a promising start. The decent pacing is a result of the great performances from the cast. And the average level of polish is thanks to being under budget, but dragged down by some of the tension among cast and crew affecting the final quality. We'll keep working on these in the editing room, and we can also try to reduce or draw more attention to other aspects of the film. Thoughts?"
<BR/>"Seems on the right track to me," Gene says.
<BR/>Greta looks thoughtful. "Maybe," she says. "Let's see what more time in the editing booth brings, shall we?"
<BR/>You spend the rest of the day hammering out plans for the editing…

<BR/>The rest of the week you alternate between the editing room, managing operations, and talking with distributors. It's an uphill battle to convince theater chains (and sometimes, even individual theaters) to show a film from an upstart studio without a track record.
<BR/>You've also got to keep your production staff occupied, now that shooting on Outcast Odyssey's wrapped up. What should you do?
<BR/><B>CHOICES:</B>
- Put another Studio McStudioface film into production. This will cost money and stress, but create good buzz for the picture.

<BR/>Not every picture's going to be a Outcast Odyssey. To stay in business, you'll have to get a regular pipeline going. You hire a producer to get a new project moving and keep the lot bustling.
<BR/>Midweek, you're scribbling your signature on some checks when Fish Grundy knocks on your office door.
<BR/>"What can I do for you, Fish?" you say, setting down your pen and massaging your cramping hand as he drops into the seat across from you.
<BR/>He takes off his hat, putting it in his lap and fiddling with the brim. "Be real brief," he says. "Got an idea for a new project maybe you and I could work on together. It's bonafide cinema gold, Flowers. Perfect for Studio McStudioface. Like to hear the pitch?"
<BR/>Before you can respond, he leans forward, gripping his hat tightly. "Look, I know you're not supposed to have nothing to do with me, on account of Creed's miserable blacklist. Flowers, this thing is squeezing me dry. I can't get work. People I knew thirty years, they won't take my calls. I'll stand outside their office, they won't even open the door." He shakes his head. "Working with me now's a risk. They could shut you down, put you in jail even. I know that. You bet I do. But…I got to ask. To at least just ask."
<BR/>He leans back, looking tired, as you consider how to respond.
<BR/><B>CHOICES:</B>
- "Of course. I'd love to work with you again, even if my studio comes under fire."
- "Maybe we could work together, unofficially. If we kept it under the table, we might not get caught."
- "I'll never stop being your friend, but you know I can't work with you until this blows over. Maybe I could help out some other way?"
- "I'd love to, but the studio just can't afford another project right now. You know how it is."
- "I'm sorry, but I can't help you. It's too dangerous for me and my crew."
- "Maybe it's best if we're not seen together any more."

<BR/>By Friday, the gauntlet of editing has mostly pushed Fish Grundy's problems from your mind. You're living and breathing reels of footage, now, dreaming in alternate takes and manufactured moments: the weight that twenty extra frames adds to a single look, the intimacy of playing a scene in close-ups instead of medium shots. You've become a machine for constructing the perfect version of Outcast Odyssey, the Moviola's metal bulk your body, its reels and runners your appendages, its glowing screen your mind.

<BR/>They roll their eyes, spinning a loose pickup reel playfully. "I thought we were supposed to be getting to know each other better," they say, "and I like to cut to the chase."
<BR/>They think for a moment, looking down at their salvaged filmstrip. "What did you do during the war?" they ask softly.
<BR/>You sigh. "Not big into small talk, are you?" you say, pondering your response to the Question. Apparently, the one everyone in your generation's doomed to forever ask and answer.

<BR/>So Vic starts the telling, haltingly at first, then picking up speed. It's no less hard to hear for having some notes in common with plenty of others you've heard. Like a lot of them, it starts with a high school sweetheart, some disapproving parents, and a plan born of desperation and painful love.

<BR/>She wanted to be a nightclub singer. Had the voice for it. Vic followed her from city to city, always looking for gigs. "I would have followed her straight into hell," they say flatly. "Nearly did."
<BR/>But she didn't know when to stop. She became obsessed, started forgetting the life she was actually living for the one she craved so much. Neglect bred quarrels, then screams. Finally, she left.
<BR/>"Left me broke, alone, in a bad place," Vic says, slamming a fist against the side of the Moviola. "Halfway across the country, no diploma, no prospects. And then the war." They shrug. "So I did what I had to. That's all. And maybe you understand a smidge better now why treating people right matters so much to me. A movie don't cry itself to sleep if you neglect it a while."
<BR/>"Is this why you're afraid of moving up in the ranks?" you say, softly. "Without a diploma—"

"I didn't even realize how in love I still was, even then. I never did make my peace."
<BR/>They sigh, chucking the film scrap into the trash. "Sometimes I think I ought to go back home. Visit her grave. Forgive her, maybe, forgive myself. Maybe even get that diploma. I expect my teachers are all still there, waiting. Most of 'em were too ornery to die."

<BR/>After lunch, you both return to your duties. For the rest of the day, Vic seems…preoccupied. You don't think much of it at the time, with a million other concerns distracting you, but in hindsight it should have been obvious that a major decision was working its way through their mind…
<BR/><B>NEXT PAGE...</B>
<BR/>Saturday. For once, you're staying home, snagging a much-deserved weekend off before you forget what they're like.
<BR/>You're working your way through the paper, a rare squall of rain pattering against the window, when someone knocks on your front door. You pull it open to find Vic Martinez standing on your doorstep in a rain slicker, damp but determined. Holding a suitcase.
<BR/>"What's all this?" you say, too surprised to remember to say hello.
<BR/>"Seems my pa died," they say simply, but shrugs off your shocked reaction. "Weren't that close, but it's the last straw. Too many headstones back home that ain't been visited. Too much unfinished business." They take a deep breath. "Been thinking about what you said. And it's time to get that diploma, put some things to bed. Ran away from so many things, back then. I'll always be running unless I get this sorted out."
<BR/>"I thought you seemed preoccupied, last couple of days," you say. "But sweetheart, surely you can't be leaving so quickly."
<BR/>They nod. "Got to catch the two o'clock train. I can't stay."
<BR/><B>NEXT PAGE...</B>
<BR/>You feel your heart sinking, something deep in your bones beginning to ache. "But when are you coming back?"
<BR/>They sigh, staring into your eyes. "I can't say, Flowers. Could be a week, could be a lot, lot longer. I just don't know."
<BR/>"But I need you," you stammer, flushed by your sudden selfish honesty. "I can't get through this thing without you. Vic, I thought…I thought we were becoming something together. Something worth hanging on to."
<BR/>Suddenly they're in your arms, hugging you tighter than they've ever done before, and your hand is against their hair, and the rain is dripping into your eyes.
<BR/>They pull back. "Maybe," they say. "But I have to figure my own self out first, and the only place I can do that is back home."

<BR/>They bend leans up to give you a peck on the cheek, then heft the heavy suitcase. "Good luck, chief. Good luck with Outcast Odyssey. Hell, good luck with everything."
<BR/>They walk off into the drizzling rain, and it's so much like a movie, you can't shake the feeling you'll never see them again.

<BR/>Chapter Ten
<BR/>"Friends, good taste isn't a matter of geography. A fine beverage is appreciated just as much in Los Angeles as it is in New York. And that's why people across the country drink Andy's Best Cider…"
<BR/>You glance at the clock. Just five more minutes till the broadcast is over. Keep it together, Floyd.
<BR/>Don Mason finishes up his commercial, speaking through the chrome microphone to his nationwide radio audience with practiced assurances: "Just remember your A-B-C's, and choose Andy's Best, with the red and gold label." He nods to you, smiling. "And friends, if you're just joining us, we're coming to you live from Studio McStudioface in Hollywood, California, where this studio's bold new visionary, Flowers Floyd, is answering questions from our listeners around the country about her first picture, Outcast Odyssey. Our listeners have already been hearing buzz about this picture, including the involvement of reclusive Hollywood legend Greta Garbo in this project." (He's kind enough not to mention, or doesn't know about, some of your publicity missteps, like the fact that nearly all of the film is shot on the studio lot, your growing reputation, fair or not, as a red and its aging black-and-white sensibilities.)
<BR/>He squints through a pair of reading glasses at some notes. "A Mrs. Davidson from Chicago, Illinois wrote in to ask this question. 'With so many coming attractions for new pictures these days,' she writes, 'I hardly know where to begin. What's one word that describes your new picture?'" Don grins at you. "What do you say, Flowers?"
<BR/>You clear your throat, thinking fast. "Well, Mrs. Davidson," you say, "the word that comes to mind is:"

<BR/>At last, the interview's over. You shake Don's hand and slip outside for a quiet moment alone while Gene helps the show's crew pack up.
<BR/>The last weeks have been rough. While your film is moving through postproduction as smoothly as you could hope, there's been no word from Vic. You wonder if they made it back home. You wonder if they're coming back.
<BR/><B>NEXT PAGE...</B>
<BR/>And the tough decisions don't stop coming. Back inside, Eugene grabs you for a screening of some of the latest special effects work. As a musical science fiction picture, Outcast Odyssey requires some movie magic to make its story come to life, and a special crew's been working hard to make these shots amazing.
<BR/>But the footage is disappointing. Rather than transporting you to another world, the seams and wires seem all too grounded in this one. What you're watching seems more likely to inspire giggles than flights of fancy. Of course, maybe you're too close to the project to see the shots objectively…will the matinee crowd even notice?
<BR/><B>CHOICES:</B>
- I don't care what it costs. The special effects have to be perfect.
- Maybe the team just needs a little inspiration. I'll stay late a few nights, help them improve their game.
- We'll fix it in the editing room: cut scenes so they need fewer effects shots, even if it messes up the pacing a little.

<BR/>On your way to the editing booth, Gene grabs your arm. "Chief, I got you an all-day exclusive with a reporter from Photoplay," he says. "Clear your calendar for Saturday; you'll be singing for your supper all day long."
<BR/>Saturday? Damn… you'd been hoping for a chance to get to know Livia Lane a little better, so you invited her for a drive up the coast to check out some art festival she wanted to see.
<BR/>Your hesitation must show, because Gene frowns. "Flowers, this is an important interview. The press has really latched on to some of your more, uh…free-thinking actions lately. They're calling you a pinko, if not downright Red. Look, your beliefs are none of my business, but they're bad press right now.

<BR/>Maybe you should give up trying to get any more work done today. On the other hand (and you're realizing more and more there's always an other hand), if you give up now, aren't you throwing away everything you've been fighting for?

<BR/>Take the rest of the afternoon off.
<BR/>You button things up quick as you can and take a long drive east, through the orange groves and little towns of the Inland Empire, driving up and down evenly squared-off roads, letting the wind blow through your hair. It takes hours, but your whirling mind does start to slow down in the end.
<BR/>By the time you get back to the city, the sun's long set, and though you feel calmer, you're nowhere near ready for bed. You decide to take a long walk to help clear your head. It might not be the safest idea, but your feet steer you clear of streetlights and guide you, roach-like, toward the dark. You find yourself wandering the paths of Griffith Park, setting an aggressive pace but no destination, hoping to force the blood from your worrying head into complaining muscles, let their problems dominate, for once.
<BR/><B>NEXT PAGE...</B>
<BR/>After hours, a quaver in your calves brings you back to the present. You feel how far you've pushed yourself and are tired at last.
<BR/>Spotting a park bench under a nearby streetlight, you shift course, thinking to take a breather before heading toward home. But a few paces away, a pile of what you thought was trash and old newspapers shifts, and a grubby face emerges along with a whiff of alcohol and unwashed skin. Stopping mid-stride, you're about to turn away when you recognize the face under the scraggly beard.
<BR/>It's that screenwriter from Paramount who wrote The Vanishing Ones. One of the first to be put on the new blacklist. The one you and Fish saw eating alone at Canter's Deli, what feels like a lifetime ago.
<BR/>"Spare a dime, lady?" he asks, and then with a squint, he recognizes you, too. "Flowers Floyd?" he says, sitting up straighter and rubbing his eyes. He looks down at himself, makes a hopeless attempt to brush himself free of newspapers with a trembling hand.
<BR/>"What happened to you?" you say despite yourself, unable to think of better words.
<BR/>He shrugs, unoffended. "Couldn't get work. Lost my friends, lost my apartment, got sick and couldn't even lift crates. Now…" he trails off, surveying his tiny kingdom of newspapers, blankets and empty bottles. "Got nothing left," he finishes.
<BR/>His eyes lift back up to yours. "You helped me out once," he says, grabbing your arm with an unsteady hand. "Please, Flowers, you got to help me again. Please."
<BR/><B>CHOICES:</B>
- "You can stay with me till you get back on your feet."
- "Look, here's some money. It's all I can do."

<BR/>As you stagger out of the park onto the street, the first rays of sun are just peeking over the hills. The city rumbles with presumptuous morning bustle, not understanding that all you want, at last, is your bed and sleep.
<BR/>You stop at a newsstand to buy a paper, along with some odds and ends for your new houseguest. The white-haired gent behind the counter looks askance as you hand him some change. You can't look that awful after one night without sleep, can you? It's not till half a block later that you glance down at the front page and see your picture on it: your stock head shot, smiling, utterly oblivious to the headline stamped above:

<BR/>"Hello, operator?" you say, jamming the switch hook up and down. "Are you there?"
<BR/>"Washington 239," a smooth voice says. "Who are you trying to reach, ma'am?"
<BR/>"Damn it, I was just talking to Los Angeles. Hollywood 1673. This is the third time we've been cut off."
<BR/>"Just a moment," the voice says, again. After an interminable series of buzzes, clicks, and hums, you're relieved to hear Eugene's anxious voice again: "Hello? Flowers?"
<BR/>"Finally," you say. "Look, we can't seem to get a good connection, and I'm running out of dimes. Let's keep it short. What were you saying about the ad campaign?"
<BR/><B>NEXT PAGE...</B>
<BR/>"Right," Eugene says, and you hear the faint, scratchy sound of him shuffling through notes, three thousand miles away. "We're heading into the final stretch for promotion on Outcast Odyssey. We have a decent amount of budget left for marketing. Where should we focus promotion efforts?"
<BR/><B>CHOICES:</B>

<BR/>"Got it, chief. We'll get those ads running right away. Look, before we get cut off again... how are you feeling?"
<BR/>You sigh. "I've had to abandon my film in its final weeks to fly to the other end of the country to testify before a congressional committee that hates my guts. I lost Vic Martinez, Livia Lane won't speak to me, it's eleven o'clock the night before my Capitol Hill dog and pony show and all I want to do is get to my hotel room and sleep. How do you think I'm feeling?"
<BR/>There's a long enough pause that your hand moves toward the telephone, assuming you've been cut off again, but Gene blurts out: "I'm sorry, Flowers. Everyone back home's rooting for you. I hope you know that."
<BR/>"I do," you say wearily. "Now, Eugene, if that's all…"
<BR/>He hesitates. "There's one more thing."
<BR/><B>NEXT PAGE...</B>
<BR/>"At the bottom of your luggage," he continues, speaking quietly, "there's a manila envelope. It contains a certain photograph that, er, came into my possession a few days ago. Thought it might come in handy. Good luck."
<BR/>"Photograph? What photograph?" But the line's hissing and buzzing now. Whether your assistant hung up or the connection's been cut yet again is a mystery only the ladies at Washington 239 could solve.
<BR/>Curious, you put down the receiver and take the rickety elevator up to your room. Your luggage lies untouched on the bed. Riffling through changes of clothes and scripts to read, sure enough, you find an unfamiliar envelope. You tear it open and upend it. A single black and white photo tumbles out, and once you realize what it's showing, you sit down heavily on the hotel bed.
<BR/>The figure on the right is Pavel Rucinski, disgraced leader of the Hollywood Propaganda League. He's easy to recognize, since his picture's been in the paper even more than yours lately. An immigrant to Hollywood who worked on several films sympathetic to Communism before the blacklist kicked in, Creed's committee say he's now gone underground, colluding in secret with studios to insert propaganda into their pictures.
<BR/>Unlike the mug shots in the paper, this photo shows him smiling, hand on the shoulder of his companion. It's the identity of this second person that makes your knees go wobbly. You don't know where Eugene got this picture, but it's a hell of a trump card to bring into your testimony tomorrow. A hell of a trump card.

<BR/>You keep a thin smile on your face, hoping you'll at least look respectful in the pictures. Brushing off the reporters' questions, you head inside.
<BR/>You're escorted to the jam-packed hearing room, where a panel of six white-haired congressmen sit behind an imposing elevated table with Creed at its center. They're all staring down at the small, lonely spot where, you realize, you're meant to sit and testify.
<BR/>"Thank you for being here today, Miss Floyd," Creed says as you take your seat, and the general murmur dies down. "The other committee members and myself appreciate your cooperation with this investigation. I will now swear in the witness."
<BR/>You place your hand on the official Bible. "Do you solemnly swear the testimony you shall give this committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?"
<BR/>Though it's a question, it's not a choice. Those who refuse to swear in are held in contempt of court and charged with impeding a congressional investigation, sometimes even treason. Once you're sworn in you can plead the Fifth if you like, but for now, you can only say:
<BR/><B>CHOICE MADE: </B>"I do."
<BR/>"I'll remind the witness," Creed says pleasantly, "that the penalty for perjury is a minimum of one year in prison, with the potential for further charges if this committee is able to demonstrate your involvement in any un-American activities. I'm sure she'll bear this in mind during the course of her testimony today."
<BR/>You nod, mind whirling. What you say today will affect not only your own fate, but also that of your film, your studio, your staff, and your friends. You try to keep your heartbeat under control, stop the sweat from beading on your forehead. A few flashbulbs snap; chairs squeak. It's going to be one hell of a show.
<BR/>You try to gauge the mood of the committee, who've no doubt pored over your file thoroughly, studied your past through a microscope. Interesting, you note with detachment. The members of the committee look down at you with angry suspicion. You mop nervous sweat from your brow with shaking hands.
<BR/>Creed clears his throat, looks down at his notes for a moment, then looks up with a polite smile, hands folded before him. "Miss Floyd, you are the founder and principal creative force behind the motion picture studio Studio McStudioface, are you not?"

"This investigation has shown time and time again that these so-called independent studios are a rich breeding ground for subversives and Communist agents. The self-styled free thinkers and armchair radicals in these studios enjoy feeling as if they're bucking the system, thumbing their nose at the establishment. This unfortunate attitude makes them susceptible to the highly trained agents hoping to turn the Hollywood dream machine into a factory for Red propaganda. Whether willing collaborators or unwitting dupes, the result is the same: the corruption of wholesome American entertainment into a tool of the enemy. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take a few moments to establish the kind of behavior that occurs at a 'typical' indie studio."
<BR/>The next hour is exhausting. Creed marches through a laundry list of improprieties, real and imagined, questioning your personal life, your professional accomplishments, and everything in between. Did you work your way up in the industry honestly, or by taking advantage of your male colleagues? Did you willfully ignore suggestions to cull subversive elements from your film? Have you frequently and repeatedly endangered the life of a young girl by allowing her to wander a dangerous film set filled with fire hazards? Isn't the science fiction genre often use to hide perverse ideologies in a seemingly innocuous wrapper, ideal for brainwashing its youthful audience? Isn't your film filled with titillating, overtly sexual images designed to appeal to susceptible youth and expose them to your screenplay's dangerous ideas? Did you harass a small dog at a private citizen's home? The questions veer from the merely ridiculous to the downright insulting.

<BR/>You answer each question as best you can, even some of the uglier ones, clarifying whenever you're allowed to speak long enough to do so. But you're so stressed that some of your answers seem contradictory or evasive, despite your best efforts, and you don't make as many friends on the committee as you might have if you'd been more calm and collected.
<BR/>The members of the committee look down at you with angry suspicion. You mop nervous sweat from your brow with shaking hands.
<BR/>Finally, the questioning pauses while Creed consults with the other committee members. You take a sip of water to wet your parched throat, and wipe the sweat off your brow. The heat is stifling, which you imagine is no accident.
<BR/>Creed turns forward again. "Just a few more questions, Miss Floyd. Would the bailiff please show the photo marked Exhibit 7 to the witness?"
<BR/>The officer hands you a black and white photo, and your heart skips a beat. It's a different picture, but the same face in the photo from your luggage, the one that's right now burning a hole in your pocket.
<BR/>"This is Pavel Rucinski, a Soviet agent, professional agitator, and welcome guest of the Red Chinese while American soldiers were giving their lives in the Korean war. Have you ever seen this gentleman before or had any interactions with him?"
<BR/>You certainly have never seen him in person, so you have no trouble answering: "No, sir, I have not."
<BR/>Creed leans forward in his seat. "Miss Floyd. Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist Party?"
<BR/>You've thought long and hard about this question: whether to lie or tell the truth, whether to volunteer information or give one-word answers, whether to answer at all. You say:
<BR/><B>CHOICES:</B>
- "Absolutely not."
- "No, sir, I am not."
- "I attended some meetings in college, but no, I've never been a Party member."
- "I used to be a Party member, but am not at present."
- "Yes, I am a Party member."
- "My political leanings are not any business of this committee."
- "No, sir. As a Hollywood big shot, I have it on good authority that the Commies throw lousy parties."

<BR/>"And during the time you have been in Hollywood," he continues, "have you had any dealings, professionally or personally, with Communists?"
<BR/>"I work with people of all political persuasions," you say truthfully.
<BR/>"I see," Creed continues. "And have you been encouraged by any of these friends of yours to use your position as a studio head to disseminate Red propaganda? Are you in fact actively involved in this corruption as we speak?"
<BR/>"Of course not," you say.
<BR/>"I believe you are, Miss Floyd," Creed says, razor-sharp eyes locked with yours. "I believe you're part of a vast network within Hollywood, encompassing both the studio system and the independents, that is trying to destroy this country by filling our motion pictures with Red propaganda." His eyes flick up to the audience of the packed hearing room behind you. "But it's the independents, friends, who are the real danger."
<BR/><B>NEXT PAGE...</B>
<BR/>He folds his hands, a self-satisfied smirk on his face. "Think for a moment. Who are these people, these 'independents?' Those too talentless or antisocial to make it with real picture studios. They are losers, gentlemen, by definition. They are immigrants, perverts, radicals. They style themselves trendsetters, makers of public opinion. These would-be Hollywood visionaries think they can tell Americans what movies are. But their product can hardly be called motion pictures at all." He leans forward, turning his relentless gaze back on you. "Your cardboard sets, your washed-up actors, your shoddy storylines can't stand up to A-pictures from legitimate studios. And while you independents have impeded our investigation at every turn, the real studios have cooperated with us, doing their duty and upholding the blacklist."
<BR/>He leans back. "Americans don't want your politics or your agenda in their movies. But more importantly, the government does not want your anti-American messages disseminated. These films are a cancer on this country. They must and will be stopped."

<BR/>Creed gives you about a sentence and a half before banging his gavel impatiently. "Thank you, Miss Floyd. When we're interested in further testimony from you, you can be sure we'll ask for it."
<BR/>"The committee would now like to demonstrate that Miss Floyd's sworn testimony under oath here today is nothing but a plain and rotten lie. We would like to call Mr. Fish Grundy to the stand."
<BR/>Your heart skips a beat as you turn in your chair, along with every witness in the gallery.
<BR/>Walking slowly up the aisle in a faded brown suit is Fish. He stares straight ahead, not meeting anyone's eyes, yours least of all, though you're desperate to catch his glance—if only to see if you still recognize what's behind it.
<BR/><B>NEXT PAGE...</B>
<BR/>Fish sits at a podium between you and the committee, facing the audience, meaning he has to do an awkward twist to see his questioners. The bailiff swears him in and he stays there immobile, sweltering in the heat.
<BR/>"Mr. Grundy," Creed opens pleasantly, "good of you to join us once again. When you last were summoned before this committee you were uncooperative and refused to answer our questions. I believe you have indicated a willingness to be more forthcoming on this occasion, is that correct?"
<BR/>Fish turns over his shoulder, mumbling something, but Creed gives him an exaggerated smile, like an anglerfish might give to a lost, lonely minnow. "Mr. Grundy, if you'd just speak into that microphone, please, perhaps we'd be able to make you out a little better."
<BR/>Fish turns back toward the crowd, clears his throat, and leans forward. "Yes, sir, I'll answer your questions," he says, the microphone making his voice too loud and weirdly wrong. You hadn't realized how much joy was woven into that voice until it had all been leached out.

<BR/>"And are you a member of the Communist Party, Mr. Grundy?"
<BR/>Fish looks straight ahead. "Until recently sir, yes, I was."
<BR/>A slight muttering echoes around the hearing room. While Fish never revealed any political leanings to you, you can't say you're all that surprised. You don't build a career around playing a slave without giving some thought to the oppression of workers.
<BR/>"And Mr. Grundy, as you know, this committee has learned that you were recently approached by Pavel Rucinski on a covert mission to insert Communist propaganda into mainstream Hollywood films. You had several meetings with him about this mission. Is that correct?"
<BR/>Fish looks over his shoulder, an almost desperate look in his eyes: Creed merely indicates the microphone, impatiently. Fish turns back around, lips pressed together, then bends into the microphone, and says, "Yes, sir. That is correct."
<BR/>Now the room erupts in shocked mutters. You sit back in your chair, face ashen. Why's Grundy doing this? Did they threaten him with something?

"'At the time of my meeting with Mr. Rucinski, I had been taken in by the Communist propaganda machine." He looks up, eyes scanning the room nervously. "I…I used to think there wasn't no harm in putting a message into pictures, if it was a good one. Thought maybe it was a way to make things better for certain folks. But I've come to realize that I…" He frowns and looks down at the paper again. "I…was misled. My ideals were used against me, to make me a…a dupe, who unwittingly advanced the agenda of the Communist appa…apparatus."
<BR/>Fish continues to read, in a dull, expressionless tone. When he finishes, he slips off his reading glasses and lets the page fall to the table, staring down at it listlessly. The hearing room is silent.

<BR/>"To my knowledge, sir, yes, she has."
<BR/>"I would like at this time to offer into the record a photograph marked Exhibit 9," Creed says smoothly, "taken in Griffith Park a few nights ago. The quality is not up to Hollywood standards, I'm afraid, but I think it's clear the figure on the right is Miss Floyd. The spring-colored scarves," he smiles, "are quite distinctive. Mr. Grundy, would you identify the figure on the left for us, please?"
<BR/>"It's…pretty blurry," Fish says, hands shaking. "I'm not sure if I…"
<BR/>Creed leans forward. "Mr. Grundy," he says, "you might recall our discussion earlier, where I mentioned this committee would be open to reconsidering your position on the blacklist in light of any useful information you could provide to our investigation. So far today, Mr. Grundy, you have not been particularly useful. Please look again, and do try your best to identify this individual for us, won't you?"

<BR/>"Mr. Donald Ferrel," Creed says, "a former screenwriter and Communist agent trained to specialize in youth recruitment activities, now blacklisted. Please make it part of the record that this photograph records Mr. Ferrel and Miss Floyd having a secret late-night meeting in Griffith Park. Mr. Grundy, to your knowledge, are Miss Floyd and Mr. Ferrel associates of any kind?"
<BR/>"Well," Fish says, "I mean, they had lunch at the same diner once, but that hardly—"
<BR/>"In fact, the two are much more than lunching companions, Mr. Grundy," Creed says. "According to our information, Mr. Ferrel is actually currently residing with Miss Floyd at her home in Hollywood.
<BR/>"Thank you, Mr. Grundy, that will be all," Creed says. Voices rise to a mutter, but this time he lets them run their course with a smug smile, poorly disguised as a look of concern. "Your cooperation here today will be noted when we review your case. You may step away from the stand."

<BR/>Creed chuckles. "No, I suppose not. Let me ask this, however. During the time of her employ, although she produced a number of pictures for your studio, it's true that she was never able to get a project of her own off the ground, despite many attempts to do so, is that right?"
<BR/>"That's correct," Creed says.
<BR/>"Mr. Croghan, I find it odd that an employee of such obviously limited talent, one with no track record of success, was able shortly after leaving the watchful eye of your studio to suddenly raise enough funding to start her own production company." Creed shakes his head in mock confusion. "There must be some explanation for this unlikely investment. Perhaps it came from a group that wanted nothing more than to find someone impressionable like Miss Floyd, someone they could control and manipulate." Creed leans forward. "You're one of the most senior and respected figures in your industry, Mr. Croghan, and you worked with Miss Floyd for years, so I put the question to you: wouldn't you say that collusion with a group like Mr. Rucinski's is the only possible explanation for Miss Floyd's meteoric rise to an undeserved fame?"
<BR/>Croghan leans forward into the microphone and clears his throat. "No, Mr. Creed. I would not."

<BR/>Whispers rise from the gallery and Creed, taken aback, opens his mouth to respond, but Croghan continues talking. "When Flowers was a member of my staff, I found her hotheaded, poor at taking direction from others, and difficult to work with. We did not see eye to eye. But she was not incompetent, nor was she 'impressionable.'" He smiles just a little. "In fact, I daresay she might be one of the most talented people I've ever employed."
<BR/>Nervous laughter erupts through the room. Creed, flustered, gives the gavel a brisk bang. "Thank you, Mr. Croghan, that will be all."
<BR/>Lloyd nods, unfolds his hands, and takes his leave of the stand, giving you a nod as he passes by that you're utterly unsure what to do with.

<BR/><B>LAST CHAPTER!</B>
<BR/>Chapter Twelve
<BR/>Your big premiere at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre turns out to be a bittersweet night.
<BR/>Though you managed to avoid being blacklisted by Creed's committee, you've been surprised at how many people have turned against you in the weeks since your testimony. Old friends, people you've done business with for decades, have called you a fink, a traitor, a Nazi, and worse in the opinion pages, in the trades, behind your back, and sometimes even to your face.
<BR/>There's enough buzz around your production that you had no trouble filling seats for the premiere. You step onto the red carpet, ready or not, to introduce Outcast Odyssey to the world. You smile as cheerfully as you can, looking around to see who else has arrived. There's Maria Ripley, grinning for photographers and shaking hands with fans beyond the velvet rope. Some of the other drunk outcasts are working the red carpet, laughing despite all they've been through. There's Romana and Ada getting out of a limousine in matching dresses, your niece looking positively miserable in hers but smiling bravely for the cameras anyway. You catch a glimpse of Greta Garbo, talking easily with—is that Errol Flynn? The press are eating it up.
<BR/>Somehow, the roll call makes the people who aren't here feel even more visible. And as you look around, reflecting back on all you've been through, you find your heart aching for…

<BR/>You try to make your excuses and escape as quick as you can, but one of them stops you with a hand on your arm.
<BR/>"Took some guts, exposing Croghan like that," he says with a grin. "Never liked that old skeleton, myself. Not surprised the bastard's a Red. Probably a perv, too. That little bow tie." He makes plucking motions near his lapel to general chuckles from his companions, but this is the last conversation you want to be part of right now. You turn to walk away.
<BR/>As you go, you hear the producer rattle on: "Hear things are pretty grim over at the old man's studio. Deals drying up, talent getting out like rats leaving a sinking ship. Hell, I hear the old bastard's even taken up cigars again."
<BR/>As the lobby door swings shut on the knowing chuckles, you try to work out why this statement bothers you. Then you realize.
<BR/>How long has it been since Croghan stopped smoking?
<BR/>Was it before the fire at your studio?

Within a few minutes of the film's opening credits, you can't take it any more and retreat to the lobby. Every cough, every chair squeak, every muttered whisper could mean so many things, most of them bad. The pressure is too much to bear. Looking for a quiet spot for a few minutes alone, you flee down a hallway, open a side door, and step into a storage area behind the screen, filled with crates, extra seats, and an ancient, mothballed projector.
<BR/>The glow from your film paints the room in shifting patterns of light and shadow, and the shifting image looms up before you: mirrored, huge, and distorted. A shield, now, between you and your unseen audience. Reassured, you sit on a crate and take deep breaths, letting your heartbeat slow and mind wander.
<BR/>This isn't how you envisioned this night would be all those years ago, when Studio McStudioface was just a glimmer in your eye. Not at all.

<BR/>But the squeaking door interrupts your solitude. Annoyed, you turn to see who's bothering you now, mouth open to tell them off…but you pull up short. Stepping into the room is Vic Martinez.

<BR/>"Vic," you say, stepping forward and grasping their hand. "I didn't expect to see you here."
<BR/>"Didn't you?" they say. "You didn't think I'd miss the big premiere, did you?"
<BR/>"No, I suppose not," you say. "Is everything…"
<BR/>"Everything's fine. It's a good thing I went when I did. I'll tell you all about it later, but first…" They look at you searchingly. "I heard about what happened in Washington."
<BR/>You take a deep breath. "I told them what they wanted to hear. To save the studio. Would you have done any different?"
<BR/>"Yes," they say. "I would have. And that's the difference between us, Flowers. I'm not saying either of us is right. All I'm saying is that's the difference."

<BR/>"I never was much for fairy tales," they say with a shrug.
<BR/>They look you straight in the eyes. "We've had our ups and downs, Flowers. But we now we have to decide. Do you want to try to make this work? Or should we go our separate ways, let our story end?"

<BR/>You end up sitting together, necks craned up to the luminous screen, watching from the worst seat in the house—or maybe the best—you're not entirely sure. As the comfortable beats of the story play out, rhythms familiar as your heart, you smile on cue at the funny bits and can't help but tear up when the sad ones come. Every moment's predestined, burned into a spool of unraveling celluloid, but even so, you thrill at the reversals, strain against the inevitable conclusion.

<BR/>Outcast Odyssey, reviewed by Robert Langdon for Photoplay
<BR/><I>The long-awaited debut from Studio McStudioface, Outcast Odyssey, is nothing short of a revelation. This clever picture deftly weaves together genres to make something bold and original. Directed effortlessly by Thomas Avery, this black-and-white tale of the leader of a group of drunk outcasts (newcomer Maria Ripley) on a journey to find herself is a coup for the new studio, which survived a near-catastrophic fire and harassment by Congress on the road to getting this stunning picture made.
The film's good points are almost too many to mention, but at the least include its smart storyline, its above-average screenplay, its top-notch performances and its deft technical craft. Ripley, in particular, delivers a standout performance almost certain to be noticed by the Academy come awards season. The technical quality of the film is stunning, setting a new bar for production standards even from the big-name studios.
There are a few points for a critic to nitpick, such as its reliance on genre formula. And mainstream audiences might be put off by its relatively unknown cast and its egghead script. However, if viewers take a chance on this picture, I think they will find it to be well worth the investment.</I>

<BR/>Epilogue
<BR/>"And now, to present the next award, please welcome Oscar winner Spencer Tracy."
<BR/>Vic pokes your shoulder. "This is you," they whisper.
<BR/>"Oh, knock it off," you mutter back with a grin, adding "both of you" when you see Eugene give a hopeful thumbs up from the seat behind you. "There's no way. Can't you just enjoy the party? And smile for the camera." You point towards the television cameras in the aisles: for the first time ever, the Academy Awards are being televised.
<BR/>Vic sticks their tongue out at the lens, which you can only hope is presently focused on Mr. Tracy instead.

<BR/>You leap to your feet, grinning widely, as the applause begins. But as you walk up the aisle, you can't help but notice how many people aren't applauding. How many are turning their heads away as you walk by.
<BR/>You won't let their sour grapes over your testimony ruin this day. You did what you had to.
<BR/>You feel the solid heft of the gold statue and shake Spencer Tracy's hand, trying to put the thoughts out of your mind. This is what you always wanted. Isn't it?
