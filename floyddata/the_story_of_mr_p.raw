						<strong><em>The Story of Mr. P.</em> by Hannes</strong><br/>

					<p class="leftalign">
					<span class="fontish smaller">Like ClubFloyd, the idea behind NightFloyd is that a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.<br><br>Unlike ClubFloyd, NightFloyd often takes on significantly larger works of interactive fiction, knowing going in that each one will take multiple sessions (but not always, as you'll see in this transcript). NightFloyd is also a bit more informal than ClubFloyd in that it's only announced on the ifMUD #clubfloyd bulletin board, and the time shifts around to meet player's schedules far more than ClubFloyd does. NightFloyd is organized by genericgeekgirl, aka Adri.<br>
						<br>
						Below is a transcript of
						
						
						<em>The Story of Mr. P.</em> written by Hannes.
						<I>The Story of Mr. P</I> was released as part of the 2014 Spring Thing. 
						
						You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting

					<span class="warning">WARNING!</span>
					<span class="fontish smaller">Below you will find a transcript of
						people playing this game, and it goes without saying that
						the transcript is full of spoilers. So, if you've never
						played this game, and think you might like to at some
						point, I do not recommend reading any further. Instead,
						you might want to return to the <a class="decorate" href=

<b>Floyd</b> | Here you spend your sleeping hours. Margaret was, just like for the
<b>Floyd</b> | rest of the house, responsible for decorating and arranging the room
<b>Floyd</b> | when you moved in. Without a doubt, she did this with her very own eye
<b>Floyd</b> | for detail. Once or twice, she hinted that you have been
<b>Floyd</b> | insufficiently appreciative of this. Maybe, but you do recognize the
<b>Floyd</b> | things of real practical value, like the calendar on the wall, at
<b>Floyd</b> | least!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Next to the bed, there is a nightstand. You can enter the living room
<b>Floyd</b> | from here. Because you are not using the second door, located opposite
<b>Floyd</b> | to the window, you have decided to place the wardrobe right in front
<b>Floyd</b> | of it.

<b>Floyd</b> | <span class="floydstyle em">Geschichte des Herrn P.</span>, it was adapted into English in early
<b>Floyd</b> | 2014. This English release 1 is technically equivalent with the German
<b>Floyd</b> | release 4. The author loves receiving all kinds of feedback and game
<b>Floyd</b> | transcripts at hannes (at) yllr.net.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Particular thanks go out to Martin Barth and Martin Oehm who were
<b>Floyd</b> | there for advice and tests all through the development phases. In
<b>Floyd</b> | addition, Michael Baltes, Colin Djukic, Marius Müller and Mischa
<b>Floyd</b> | Magyar tested the beta versions - thank you as well! This English
<b>Floyd</b> | version comes to you thanks to Brian Cowell, Andrew Schultz and Jerry
<b>Floyd</b> | Ford, all of whom tirelessly waded through my attempts at finding

<b>Floyd</b> | Here you spend your sleeping hours. Margaret was, just like for the

<b>Floyd</b> | when you moved in. Without a doubt, she did this with her very own eye
<b>Floyd</b> | for detail. Once or twice, she hinted that you have been
<b>Floyd</b> | insufficiently appreciative of this. Maybe, but you do recognize the
<b>Floyd</b> | things of real practical value, like the calendar on the wall, at
<b>Floyd</b> | least!
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Next to the bed, there is a nightstand. You can enter the living room
<b>Floyd</b> | from here. Because you are not using the second door, located opposite
<b>Floyd</b> | to the window, you have decided to place the wardrobe right in front
<b>Floyd</b> | of it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the bed is Margaret.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Next to the bed, there is a nightstand. You can enter the living room

<b>Floyd</b> | So this is the legendary room which Dorothy uses for her hobby:
<b>Floyd</b> | tailoring. Appropriately, it's furnished with a chest of drawers and a
<b>Floyd</b> | dress form. One exit leads into the living room, the other door into
<b>Floyd</b> | the bedroom.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | On the dress form is a colorful costume.

<b>Floyd</b> | A couple of weeks later, one of your little trips lead you back to

<b>Floyd</b> | Through the window, you see a boy sitting on the living room carpet,

<b>Floyd</b> | the table drinking coffee. When she notices you, Margaret carefully
<b>Floyd</b> | opens the window, motions her son over and hands him a cookie from the

<b>Floyd</b> | this welcome gift, you have a powerful sense that soon the cold season
