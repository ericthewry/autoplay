The idea behind ClubFloyd is that each week at a pre-arranged time, a group of people meet online to cooperatively play a game of interactive fiction.</br></br>

Below is a transcript of <i>Punk Points</i>, written by Jim&nbsp;Munroe.  <i>Punk Points</i> was originally released as part of the 2000 IF Competition, where it took twenty-second place. It was also nominated for a XYZZY for Best NPCs. You can learn more about the game, including how to download it, by visiting <A HREF="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/1017"><u>Baf's Guide</u></A>.</br>

</br><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2" COLOR="#FF0000"><b>WARNING!</b></font><FONT FACE="arial, sans-serif, helvetica" SIZE="2"> Below you will find a transcript of people playing these games, and it goes without saying that the transcript is full of spoilers.  So, if you've never played these games, and think you might like to at some point, I do not recommend reading any further.  Instead, you might want to return to the <a href="interactive_fiction.html"><u>interactive fiction </u>p<u>a</u>g<u>e</u></a>.</BR></BR></BR></FONT></P></td></tr></table>

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | At the Show
<b>Floyd</b> | You're in a dark, poorly lit and packed club. Everyone's staring at the

<b>Floyd</b> | band as they go about tuning and shifting their instruments. The guy
<b>Floyd</b> | next to you has a mohawk that flops over to the side, as if the heat
<b>Floyd</b> | had wilted it. In contrast, the skinhead in front of you is reacting to
<b>Floyd</b> | the heat like a Mexican jumping bean, the muscles of his back tensing
<b>Floyd</b> | and releasing, tensing and releasing.

</TD><td></td><td></td></TR>
<TR><td></td><TD><pre><b>Floyd</b> | Before you can do anything, the band explodes into action. The crowd
<b>Floyd</b> | coalesces into a single entity and leans towards them, then falls back,
<b>Floyd</b> | ripples. Being a part of this lurching creature makes your spine
<b>Floyd</b> | tingle.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You're pressed from all sides by people suddenly activated by sound --
<b>Floyd</b> | but you can't hear anything. You can practically feel the sonic waves,
<b>Floyd</b> | you can see it on the faces of the people around you, and you strain to
<b>Floyd</b> | hear the music...
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The guy with the mohawk plants his boot in the skinhead's linked hands.
<b>Floyd</b> | His pierced nostrils flaring, hands gripping the skinhead's shoulders,
<b>Floyd</b> | he launches himself on the crowd. Improbably, they hold him aloft as he
<b>Floyd</b> | rolls over a bed made of their shoulders, heads and outstretched hands.
<b>Floyd</b> | You can't quite believe what you're seeing, and suddenly you hear
<b>Floyd</b> | something:

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Honey?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You whip around and look to see who spoke, but there's nothing except
<b>Floyd</b> | the unremarkable brick wall of the club lined with people standing on
<b>Floyd</b> | chairs to get a better view. None of them are looking at you.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You look back. The guy with the mohawk is still rolling over the crowd,
<b>Floyd</b> | but for some reason he's got a tie on. And his blue hair is flickering
<b>Floyd</b> | like flames. The skinhead offers his linked hands to boost you up, and
<b>Floyd</b> | you quickly put your foot in. Your foot is bare. He looks at you, his

<b>Floyd</b> | dark eyes questioning.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Honey!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You look at your foot. Of course it's bare -- you're in your bed.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Your mother bustles in with your uniform, freshly ironed, and hangs it
<b>Floyd</b> | on your bathroom doorknob. "OK, honey, we're off." She stops at the
<b>Floyd</b> | foot of your bed and puts her hands on her hips. "Better hurry or
<b>Floyd</b> | you'll miss your bus. Don't want to be late the very first day of high
<b>Floyd</b> | school!"
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You smile weakly as she kisses you goodbye and leaves, trying to
<b>Floyd</b> | rekindle the feelings in your dream.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Your Room (on the bed)
<b>Floyd</b> | Your room is a mess -- posters slowly peel off the walls to join the
<b>Floyd</b> | small heaps of clothes that spot the floor like death mounds. There's a

<b>Floyd</b> | path south through the junk from your bed to your bathroom, one going
<b>Floyd</b> | north to the rest of the house.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see a school uniform here.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The mod and the goth join him, and the three of them scrutinize you in

<b>Floyd</b> | "I'm Jackson," says the mod, "They're Stuart and Dave. That was you,

<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "EXPERIMENT 4
<b>Floyd</b> | Synthesis of an Explosive: N13*NH3
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Many explosive molecules have nitrogen as one of the elemental
<b>Floyd</b> | components. Nitrogen single bonds to most atoms are quite weak, while
<b>Floyd</b> | the nitrogen - nitrogen triple bond is exceptionally stable (NH3 is an

<b>Floyd</b> | exception, in that its N-H single bonds are fairly stable). Energy
<b>Floyd</b> | liberated by the breaking of single nitrogen bonds can be substantial.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nitrogen - halogen single bonds are particularly reactive due to
<b>Floyd</b> | repulsion between the nitrogen and halide lone pairs. In this
<b>Floyd</b> | experiment you will make ammonium triiodide NI3, isolated as an

<b>Floyd</b> | ammoniate coordination complex. This compound, when dry, is a
<b>Floyd</b> | detonating explosive that is shock-sensitive. It can be handled when
<b>Floyd</b> | wet, but will explode unpredictably when dry.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | APPARATUS
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Basic glassware including 10-mL beaker, 2-mL pipette, glass rod are
<b>Floyd</b> | required for this experiment.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The product of this experiment is a shock-sensitive explosive when dry.

<b>Floyd</b> | The small amount prepared according to the procedure below is not
<b>Floyd</b> | dangerous, but larger amounts are serious explosion risks. Never scale
<b>Floyd</b> | up this procedure!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (At this point, the editors of Virus have handwritten: HA HA!)
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | PROCEDURE
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Weigh 100mg (0.100 g) of iodine into a 10-mL beaker. Slowly add 2.0 mL
<b>Floyd</b> | of concentrated ammonium hydroxide solution. Stir the mixture for 5
<b>Floyd</b> | minutes -- a red precipitate should form. Transfer the moist
<b>Floyd</b> | precipitate onto several layers of filter paper placed on the floor of

<b>Floyd</b> | the fumehood, away from any breakable objects. Spread out the solid and
<b>Floyd</b> | permit it to dry for one hour.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | While you are waiting, answer the questions provided in the laboratory.
<b>Floyd</b> | These are to be handed in before you leave the laboratory."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | (At this point, the editors have handwritten: SURE TEACH, RIGHT AFTER I
<b>Floyd</b> | FINISH BLOWING UP THE SCHOOL!)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "When the sample has dried, carefully tap it with the end of a
<b>Floyd</b> | yardstick, keeping as far away as possible. No other characterization
<b>Floyd</b> | is required, or advisable."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The teacher quiets the class down, smirking slightly but with a nervous
<b>Floyd</b> | eye on the door. Not turning around, he says, "Even if we did, we
<b>Floyd</b> | wouldn't have the equipment to distil it. You getting this down,
<b>Floyd</b> | Jaimie?"
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Yes sir. You seem to know an awful lot about making drugs, sir."

<b>Floyd</b> | The Path

<b>Floyd</b> | The Path, the thin sidewalk that links the school grounds to the real
<b>Floyd</b> | world, is neither on or off school property. It's no-man's-land, and
<b>Floyd</b> | all suspect activity takes place here. Like most legendary spots, it's
<b>Floyd</b> | rather unimpressive in actuality -- it's a butt-littered sidewalk that
<b>Floyd</b> | heads west to the school and east to freedom.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You can see Stuart here.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Path
<b>Floyd</b> | The Path, the thin sidewalk that links the school grounds to the real
<b>Floyd</b> | world, is neither on or off school property. It's no-man's-land, and

<b>Floyd</b> | all suspect activity takes place here. At night, with the moon shining
<b>Floyd</b> | down, it's a little more mysterious, but it's still just a
<b>Floyd</b> | butt-littered sidewalk going east and west.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You can see Dave here.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You and Dave are sitting against the fence, waiting for the others. You
<b>Floyd</b> | pick up and toss pebbles into the shadows across the Path. Dave keeps
<b>Floyd</b> | plucking at his skull-buckle boots and not saying anything. You wish he
<b>Floyd</b> | was more talkative, but his veil of hair (which he's dyed black for the
<b>Floyd</b> | occasion) is impenetrable.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You're a little cold. You're wearing a sleeveless union jack t-shirt
<b>Floyd</b> | without a jacket, since the rest of your ensemble -- khaki pants rolled
<b>Floyd</b> | up to show off your docs and a gelled up mohawk -- doesn't go with your
<b>Floyd</b> | dumpy corduroy jacket. You look at Dave's long overcoat with jealousy.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Stuart and Jackson appear, talking. They're dressed for the dance. "I

<b>Floyd</b> | don't -- there they are."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Hey," Stuart says, thumping against the fence opposite you. "We're
<b>Floyd</b> | late 'cause Jackson's a total pussy."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Shut up," says Jackson. "We ended up getting it, didn't we?"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yeah, well, if you had just gone in and got it..." Stuart goads,
<b>Floyd</b> | pulling the flat bottle out of his army jacket and shaking it.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "What are you shaking it for?" Dave says scornfully. "You don't shake
<b>Floyd</b> | liquor. It's not orange juice."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Stuart shrugs, unscrewing the top. "Can't hurt," a slightly embarrassed
<b>Floyd</b> | look on his face. "If you're the expert, why didn't you get it?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "What did you get?" you say, wanting to be part of the conversation.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Stuart takes a swig and hands it to you.

<b>Floyd</b> | You take a small mouthful, swallow it quickly. You pinch your nose and
<b>Floyd</b> | squeeze your eyes shut for a second, then pass on the bottle to Dave.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "So I was like, 'Jackson -- just go in and get it,'" Stuart says. "You

<b>Floyd</b> | dress like someone's dad, they'll never ask you for ID.' But he
<b>Floyd</b> | wouldn't, so we had to wait for some rocker to come along who'd buy for

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Dave takes two swigs and hands it to Jackson, who hands it to Stuart.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Even Hardcore here is drinking, guy," Stu says with a smirk, handing

<b>Floyd</b> | the bottle to you. You swig and pass it on.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You remember what happened the last time," Jackson says. "I want to
<b>Floyd</b> | actually get into the dance this time. Pannus has still got me in
<b>Floyd</b> | detention from last year!"
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Well, I mean, you puked in front of him," Dave says with a rare smile.
<b>Floyd</b> | "We're lucky we went in before you."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Stuart is snickering. "You were so fucked that night. The only thing
<b>Floyd</b> | that sucked about it was that you had a chance to puke on Penis and you
<b>Floyd</b> | puked on your own shoes. That's a shame."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Well," Jackson says, "They're obviously going to be watching me
<b>Floyd</b> | tonight, and I want to get into the dance."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "So you can show off all your skanking skills when they play One Step

<b>Floyd</b> | Beyond?" says Stuart, getting to his feet and mock-dancing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Jackson laughs, watching Stuart's scowling dance moves.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ah, it's going to suck anyway. They always do," says Dave, passing the
<b>Floyd</b> | bottle to Stuart. "The last time we missed the only Cult song they

<b>Floyd</b> | played."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "That's why we should have got the stuff faster," says Stuart over the
<b>Floyd</b> | bottle. "We would have gotten in with the first rush of people and no
<b>Floyd</b> | one would notice we were drunk."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Yeah, it's not like we stick out or anything," Jackson says dryly.
<b>Floyd</b> | "Besides, who was the one who was a half-hour late getting to my place
<b>Floyd</b> | tonight?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You take another swig. It's not getting any less vile, but it's almost
<b>Floyd</b> | finished.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "How hard is it to go into a store and buy something?" says Stuart.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You're almost a year older than me. You're sixteen," Jackson says.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You're a bit nervous with the mention of age, since you're thirteen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Rolling his eyes, Stuart takes the bottle from Dave and finishes it
<b>Floyd</b> | off. "It doesn't have anything to do with that. With my innocent young
<b>Floyd</b> | face, I couldn't buy milk past the due date."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "OK, let's go," Jackson says, getting to his feet and pulling out some
<b>Floyd</b> | gum. He hands everyone one piece, which you start to chew. Blueberry.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you get up, you notice a little dizziness. Everyone heads west,
<b>Floyd</b> | taking careful steps, and as you pass the portables Stuart whips the
<b>Floyd</b> | empty bottle into the night and cocks an ear.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | When there's no smash he frowns. "Damn. Missed the sign.".
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You enter the school and walk through the caf. The sudden bright lights
<b>Floyd</b> | intensify your dizziness into a nausea.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | The ticket table is set up just outside the gym door, beside the
<b>Floyd</b> | stairwell. The sudden stop in front of it brings up bile. The senior,
<b>Floyd</b> | who's taken Jackson's ticket and let him go, looks at you guardedly.
<b>Floyd</b> | Then he tells you to wait.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | A moment later, Mr. Collins, the gym teacher appears. He's got a hockey

<b>Floyd</b> | stick over his shoulder and a smarmy grin on his face.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "What have you boys been up to tonight," he says, tapping at your
<b>Floyd</b> | mohawk with the flat of his stick. "Other than hairdressing?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The know-it-all attitude sets off an explosion of rage -- and,

<b>Floyd</b> | unfortunately, also detonates an acid ball in your stomach. You're
<b>Floyd</b> | going to be sick.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Cafeteria
<b>Floyd</b> | While you know that the cafeteria is its same old dingy self, your
<b>Floyd</b> | brain is telling you that it's spinning and painfully bright.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Mr. Collins, the obnoxious overgrown jock of a gym teacher, stands
<b>Floyd</b> | beside two of his apes behind the ticket table set up for the dance.
<b>Floyd</b> | He's grinning in a nauseatingly infuriating way. God, you feel ill.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "EXPERIMENT 4

<b>Floyd</b> | Synthesis of an Explosive: N13*NH3
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Many explosive molecules have nitrogen as one of the elemental
<b>Floyd</b> | components. Nitrogen single bonds to most atoms are quite weak, while
<b>Floyd</b> | the nitrogen - nitrogen triple bond is exceptionally stable (NH3 is an
<b>Floyd</b> | exception, in that its N-H single bonds are fairly stable). Energy

<b>Floyd</b> | liberated by the breaking of single nitrogen bonds can be substantial.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Nitrogen - halogen single bonds are particularly reactive due to
<b>Floyd</b> | repulsion between the nitrogen and halide lone pairs. In this
<b>Floyd</b> | experiment you will make ammonium triiodide NI3, isolated as an
<b>Floyd</b> | ammoniate coordination complex. This compound, when dry, is a

<b>Floyd</b> | detonating explosive that is shock-sensitive. It can be handled when
<b>Floyd</b> | wet, but will explode unpredictably when dry.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | APPARATUS
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Basic glassware including 10-mL beaker, 2-mL pipette, glass rod are

<b>Floyd</b> | required for this experiment.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | The product of this experiment is a shock-sensitive explosive when dry.
<b>Floyd</b> | The small amount prepared according to the procedure below is not

<b>Floyd</b> | dangerous, but larger amounts are serious explosion risks. Never scale
<b>Floyd</b> | up this procedure!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (At this point, the editors of Virus have handwritten: HA HA!)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | PROCEDURE

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Weigh 100mg (0.100 g) of iodine into a 10-mL beaker. Slowly add 2.0 mL
<b>Floyd</b> | of concentrated ammonium hydroxide solution. Stir the mixture for 5
<b>Floyd</b> | minutes -- a red precipitate should form. Transfer the moist
<b>Floyd</b> | precipitate onto several layers of filter paper placed on the floor of
<b>Floyd</b> | the fumehood, away from any breakable objects. Spread out the solid and

<b>Floyd</b> | permit it to dry for one hour.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | While you are waiting, answer the questions provided in the laboratory.
<b>Floyd</b> | These are to be handed in before you leave the laboratory."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | (At this point, the editors have handwritten: SURE TEACH, RIGHT AFTER I

<b>Floyd</b> | FINISH BLOWING UP THE SCHOOL!)
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "When the sample has dried, carefully tap it with the end of a
<b>Floyd</b> | yardstick, keeping as far away as possible. No other characterization
<b>Floyd</b> | is required, or advisable."

<b>Floyd</b> | puked on your own shoes. That's a shame."
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | "Well," Jackson says, "They're obviously going to be watching me
<b>Floyd</b> | tonight, and I want to get into the dance."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "So you can show off all your skanking skills when they play One Step

<b>Floyd</b> | Beyond?" says Stuart, getting to his feet and mock-dancing.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Jackson laughs, watching Stuart's scowling dance moves.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Ah, it's going to blow anyway," says Dave, passing the bottle to
<b>Floyd</b> | Stuart. "The last time we missed the only Cult song they played."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "That's why we should have got the stuff faster," says Stuart over the
<b>Floyd</b> | bottle. "We would have gotten in with the first rush of people and no
<b>Floyd</b> | one would notice we were drunk."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Yeah, it's not like we stick out or anything," Jackson says dryly.

<b>Floyd</b> | "Besides, who was the one who was a half-hour late getting to my place
<b>Floyd</b> | tonight?"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "How hard is it to go into a store and buy something?" says Stuart.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "You're almost a year older than me. You're sixteen," Jackson says.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You're a bit nervous with the mention of age, since you're thirteen.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Rolling his eyes, Stuart takes the bottle from Dave and finishes it
<b>Floyd</b> | off. "It doesn't have anything to do with that. With my innocent young
<b>Floyd</b> | face, I couldn't buy milk past the due date."

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "OK, let's go," Jackson says, getting to his feet and pulling out some
<b>Floyd</b> | gum. He hands everyone one piece, which you start to chew. Blueberry.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Everyone heads west, taking careful steps, and as you pass the
<b>Floyd</b> | portables Stuart whips the empty bottle into the night. A second or two

<b>Floyd</b> | later there's a distant, but still tremendously satisfying, smash.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You enter the school, Stu crowing and pumping his fist, until you get
<b>Floyd</b> | to the side of the walk through the caf to where they've set up the
<b>Floyd</b> | ticket table.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | You and Jackson get in with your tickets but Stuart and Dave are
<b>Floyd</b> | stopped at the door.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | As you enter the stairwell area, you hear a crash from the caf. Mr.
<b>Floyd</b> | Collins, hockey stick in hand, rushes past you.
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | Jackson gives you a raised eyebrow and heads down the stairs. You
<b>Floyd</b> | follow him to...
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | School Gymnasium Pretending To Be A Dance Hall
<b>Floyd</b> | All the disco balls in the world can't hide the fact that this is a
<b>Floyd</b> | school gym with the lights off. They've hung streamers from the

<b>Floyd</b> | basketball nets and two gigantic speakers flank the DJ's table on the
<b>Floyd</b> | stage. The washroom is to the south and you can leave up the stairs to
<b>Floyd</b> | the east. The student council has done a half-assed job of decorating
<b>Floyd</b> | the walls with construction paper leaves, footballs and Peanuts
<b>Floyd</b> | characters, but what's leaning against the walls is far more
<b>Floyd</b> | interesting: shy clumps of girls. Your heart speeds up to match the

<b>Floyd</b> | diamonds of light that sweep the floor, which has a few dancers on it.

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | [You got 5 punk points for that.]
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "I like how you dance," she says, walking up the stairs. In the sudden
<b>Floyd</b> | light, you can see that she has way too much makeup and that her legs

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You nod, dumbly.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "So you go here?" she says, looking around and noticing the gym

<b>Floyd</b> | Second Floor, West
<b>Floyd</b> | There's a prominently displayed trophy case and rows and rows of

<b>Floyd</b> | official looking plaques to impress parents on their way south to the
<b>Floyd</b> | office. The hallway continues east, and north is the way back outside.

<b>Floyd</b> | The Office
<b>Floyd</b> | The office is quiet and orderly, with a large counter separating the
<b>Floyd</b> | office proper from the visitors. Two doors against the far wall are,

<b>Floyd</b> | according to the signs, the lairs of Brother Matthews and Mr. Pannus,
<b>Floyd</b> | and sandwiched between them is a massive painting of Pope Innocent III.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Kym's trying to jot down all the juicy information, but there's too
<b>Floyd</b> | much of it.

<b>Floyd</b> | [You got 15 punk points for that.]

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | "Brilliant!" she exclaims, stuffing her notebook away and closing the
<b>Floyd</b> | disk drive. "This is gonna be the best Virus ever!"
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | You try to remember why that sounds familiar, and then pull out your
<b>Floyd</b> | well-worn copy of the zine. "You did this?"

<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She looks at it, obviously pleased that you have it. "Yup. Well, me and
<b>Floyd</b> | my friend Leo -- I do most of the work, though."
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | She stares at the screen. "I wonder how people are going to feel about
<b>Floyd</b> | the fact that the combined budgets of the art and the music departments

<b>Floyd</b> | are one third of the rugby team's?" She taps some keys and the disk
<b>Floyd</b> | drive grinds and glows red.

<b>Floyd</b> |     *** You have won ***
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> |

<b>Floyd</b> | In that game you scored 40 out of a possible 50, in 327 turns, which
<b>Floyd</b> | gives you the rank of Old School.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Eventually, you become a co-editor of Virus, and when Pannus discovers
<b>Floyd</b> | this he tries to get you expelled. But the impassioned rant you publish
<b>Floyd</b> | and distribute to the school at large -- arguing that Thou Shalt Not

<b>Floyd</b> | Lie demanded the honest journalism found in publications like Virus,
<b>Floyd</b> | and pointing out that the original meaning of "catholic" was "tolerant"
<b>Floyd</b> | -- finds its supporters in the administration, and you're just
<b>Floyd</b> | suspended.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | After graduation, you and Kym and your son get a place downtown. It's

<b>Floyd</b> | close to the market and Anthony's daycare. You get a well-paying
<b>Floyd</b> | government job and Kym volunteers as an intern at a left-wing magazine.
<b>Floyd</b> |
<b>Floyd</b> | Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, see some suggestions
<b>Floyd</b> | for AMUSING things to do or QUIT?
